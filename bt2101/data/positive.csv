generally easy to use, but still learning the different functions. picture quality is superb.
very easy to make adjustments without the need to go through loads of menus. very easy to use, packed full of features and good screen. touch screen comes in useful, didn't think it would, but i like it.
i bought this camera after trawling through a lot of reviews and i am not disappointed. can't beat it for the price.
all good bar one
so easy to use even for a novice  i have always used  a canon camera
great amatuer camera, not overly complicated and intuitive to use
very capable of 'point and shoot'
it's very easy to use on both auto and manual setting. manipulating images on playback is great and the software that comes with the camera covers everything you might need.
fantastic camera for the price :-) was the best deal on line :-) came with an additional battery, which is the only company to supply this offer. was also the bonus of the \xa350 cash back through canon :-) would thoroughly recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying a canon and doesn't know what model to buy and where from :-) superb all round camera ;-) so much still to learn and mastering the camera is something of a challenge but one i'm looking forward to completing to be able to get the ultimate best from this truely superb camera :-) previous owner of canon camera but never believed i would own a 700d :-)) one very lucky happy girl
a great dslr camera. plus i got it when there was another \xa350 off so with the canon \xa350 offer i saved \xa3100.
everything
fantastic camera for just getting into photography ! great bit of kit !
features to take different photos, excellent quality on  movies.. still in learning mode as there are lots of settings to go through.
i imagine even if you had no experience with dslrs! i love the fps - bought it for a weekend at a dark (or artificially lit) exhibition with lots of moving subjects, and it took some superb photos
if you take many family or other portraits, save up for a 430 ex ii flash which is an excellent match with this camera.  bounce flash gives great results.
overall a very good camera, excellent image quality for enter level dslr camera
screen display of all operations
the image quality is amazing! and i love how lightweight it is. carrying it around feels effortless. perfect for long shooting days that involve going to different locations.
awesome camera.
great camera. plenty of features and not to difficult to use. highly recommended.
it's an absolutely amazing first camera
just need to buy yourself a better lens and the possibiltys are endless:)
the quality of the image is very good. i was surprised at the improvement compared to my 450d. it is well balanced and i love the fold-out screen. ideal as much of my photography is done one-handed.
easy to use straight from the box on auto but with plenty of advanced features and options.
features including picture quality. lightness of camera and build -appears sturdy. looking forward to using camera extensively,
if you can afford the extra believe better to go for the 18-135 stm lens. the all you will need is in one neat package

always used canon and always will, easy to use and good quality

the camera has a fairly sturdy feel and quality of photographs is good.
lightweight and well balanced
multi angle touch screen allows simple setting of an off-centre focus point during live view shooting. 18-135mm lens worth the extra money.

the flexibility to let it do the work, or take control and try and do better yourself.
still plenty of features to explore.
good value camera, especially because it came with a second battery. big, bright lcd screen which also has touch controls - i think this is the only significant difference from the 600d.
100
great first dslr

amazing camera, really easy to grasp
its a fantastic camera for a amateur photographer its got everything you need and hd movie facilities has a added extra
every thing good about the camera was what we wanted and does and says every thing we want it to do which was brilliant as a present for my daughters uni course

value for money
it pretty much seems to do it all, you still have to point it in the right direction though.
it's a real easy camera too use , really helps with my filming
i was going to buy 1200d, but price different was so little. this has all the features i need
quality build, quality product and hell of of a lot cheaper than 5d 6d 7d
this is a quality budget camera.
i just love it. thank you
much better image quality than my old 350d. has many more options in auto made and creative mode and the 18-135 lens is ideal for most photo shooting opportunities. having hd video is a bonus too.
not to heavy to hold, good lens for a beginner like me as it covers all i need for now. still in auto mode which is pretty self explanitory
really easy to use, plenty of good features, not a vast difference from the 650d. good value.
great for those who want a professional finish, easy to use for amateurs too.
a very nice high end beginners camera, nice crisp images. added with a 50mm prime lens and maybe a 18 to 135mm zoom to get the action closer.
good picture quality with the stm lens. much better lens as standard compared to my old 450d
caters for point and shoot and for the more advanced user. good touch screen display which simplifies changing settings. can shoot video.
for the price is a very good camera.a good photo camera for the begginer, to who give the oportunity to understand from the first photos the meaning of iso ,aperture, speed and their role to a quality image.
my first pics have been taken using the auto mode and the quality is very good indeed. no regrets.
once familiarised it's very easy to use. it offers many features such as the video, iso to 12800. fits comfortably in the hand. the is 18-55 is stm lens is exceptionally good.
textured case, quality of image ... low light excellent
hdr is working excellent
absolutely made up with purchase.
light weight, easy set up and extremely good quality photos. this camera has some nice features such as touch screen. really impressed.

excellent camera. easy to use. great images.
touch screen, large display
excellent in low light situations and good image quality at high iso settings.  fast responsiveness.
as expected, in moving up from 8mp to 24mp, the increase in picture quality is significant. very much a semi-pro camera, full of useful features. easy to use, with efficient instructions and helpful tips. turned a recent holiday to prague into a pictorial delight!
all the lenses, flashgun and tripod that i was using with my eos 1200d fit the new camera so i didn't have to buy any more kit.
image quality.
great camera the touch screen is really useful.
the overall improvement on the previous canon cameras that i own and the relative price difference from high street camera shops
i have always bought canon, cameras, printers etc. great new features and picture quality especially with my new 120 - 400mm zoom lens, the sensor is a lot better for multi shots even in raw and jpeg mode, the multi angle screen comes in very useful in live mode, this is a great upgrade from my 550d, i am very pleased with this camera.
intuitive
has taken some great pictures - feels good and solid to use yet is light at the same time.
purchased as an upgrade to a previous eos version most of the features were very familiar. takes an excellent image.
live view
as usual it's a very easy to use camera because of it's intuitive menu functions.
amazing photos straight from the box and as you get to know the camera and its features gets even better.
very impressed with image quality, captures more than the eye sees
easy to use; good auto focus; reliable metering
excellent camera for the for all occasions
if you've used a previous model, the controls and menus are very similar.
ease of use
easy to use and sits comfortably in your hands.
lots of features, its going to take some time to learn to use them well
lovely feel, quality and operation
nicely made and works well.  the fippy out screen is very useful and the extra few megapixels can be useful if you want to crop.
feels sturdy, the image quality is great at 24 mp, and being used to canon cameras there wasn't much too different for me to get used to, though it is a lot easier in some cases to operate. the 18-135 lens is solidly built and performs excellently. people have complained about the weight, but i haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. all in all a superb camera, and can be used by professionals and experienced amateurs alike.
like the lock on the programme selector.
everything is good
wifi very useful and very lightweight even with satanised lens
before i got the 760d i had the 60d, these cameras are very similar so i knew how to use it straight out the box, the addition of touch screen is a bonus plus the extra pixels
continuous auto focus and flip out screen
great piece of equipment for any novice starting in the next step up in the camera world
the picture quality is amazing
i had 700d so familiar with set up still learning what new things it will do. like crop facility.
lens is a wide range zoom
canon reliability
*wifi transfer of pictures works well to a pc.
i bought this camera to replace a canon s90.  it is as easy to use and has even better low light capability.
i'm very pleased with the results from my last diving holiday.
amazing burst speed
superb pocket sized camera with high end features and good image quality.
nice build quality, shoots raw and can do 1080/60 video.
great build quality, lots of features, good image quality
full manual control in a compact, same interface as on the dslrs from canon

ease for use. build quality. much technology in your pocket
ease of transfering via wifi
easy to use picture quality very good
it was supplied at a great price, and within the allotted time for delivery - just don't expect next day delivery given where it is being supplied from
raw pictures
quality is amazing just what i wanted.. very light an convinient.. not complex easy and simple controls. love the camera and looks pretty as well.
small and compact
a wide range of features in a compact camera. manual adjustings  nearly like in srl. i like that it is easy to carry with when travelling and image quality meets most of the needs very well. faster than previous model.
good camera
clear photos
handy pocket camera with raw format! excellent image quality. easy to use.
superb images
excellent image quality in a pocketable camera
auto, you get the picture that you saw - brilliant!  my canon 5d slr will be left at home far more now!
small, easy to use. lots of features if you want to learn more about photography. great quality pictures for editing and cropping. great video quality.
build quality and features
i have used it for underwater photos only up to now and found it to be very good
photography. it's ideal for zooming in on birds in the garden or doing close up portrait shots but i would recommend that if you are a first time buyer like myself to buy a ef- s 18-135mm f3.5-5.6 is lens stm. i have had to order this lens on top of the zoom lens. i will get plenty of use out of the zoom lens but maybe wasn't needed just yet :-) but over all like i said, i am still just learning how to use a full dlsr so it's very much trial and error for me as far as lenses go. i would also recommend buying a spare battery as i used a full battery up in just half a day :-) on a slightly different note, the instruction booklet that comes with the product is also very informative and clear to understand. the camera is very well built, quite heavy, but sturdy and easy to hold and the larger view finder is very easy to look through during live view. i'm only just getting to know the camera but am in love with it already :-) :-) i would most definitely recommend it :-) :-)
a great camera, a definite semi pro product. the best apc camera i have used and a real step up from the 70d in most areas. better than my 5diii for video.
finally! i can use my x 1.4 convertor with autofocus attached to my 100 - 400mm lens.
excellent speed of focus,even on moving objects.video also very easy to use with quick change between camera and video recording.manages well in low light.excellent images...very sharp even when subject is moving.camera is able to track movement and with 10 frames per second this camera can shoot action shots easily.
build is obviously amazing with a canon xd series, but this is even better than my 5dii.
the camera was recommended for taking wildlife photos, the speed of focus and shutter speed are excellent. the photos are very sharp.
great autofocus, fast frames per second
is there anyone eith any sense that i can speak to??
excellent canon quality.
everything, it's a brilliant camera.
really easy to use
auto focus and frames per second.
very intuitive
i love the 60fps frame rate and it light to carry which is brilliant.
love it, focussing is amazing and 10fps for the price is unreal
my previous camera was a 700d, the features provided by the 7d mk2 are far superior, i just have to learn how to use it properly!!
high speed. sharp images.
ease of use and the build quality.
speed, focussing, good in the hand
as the owner of an original 7d , i wondered if the 7d mk2 could be as good as some of the reviews. well after using it for the first time taking some action shots all i can say is i'm blown away by the cameras performance even in less than ideal lighting conditions. lots more to discover yet , but canon have again made a fantastic semi pro dslr.
all in all fantastic camera and built like a tank
we have two owned in our family.
best price on the net for the 7d and pretty good turn around on customer support.
good censor, fast and quiet.
cf cards,plenty of features
camera is a joy to have , 10 frames per second and the focusing system is fantastic.
fast, great image quality, great focus. good upgrade from the 7d
gps
well built and serviceable.  good value and a significant step up for me without incurring the expense of the 5d iii.
great on safari with my 100-400 lens; and as a balance with my canon 5d mk 111.
well worth a look.
typical canon product great quality so packed with features,thanks canon
the new cross multi focus is great improvement over its previous version especially with the tracking button and autofocus. the extra sad card slot is useful. the new menu structure is better to navigate.
superb build quality and excellent images
good points have to include 10fps and focusing speed, perfect for action photography.
the camera is excellent and the image quality is superb
af, speed. overall quality.
good photos on high iso.
i attached my canon ef-s 17-55 2.8 lens and took up the cricket club which gives a good back drop for pictures, picture quality is extremely good and pin sharp.
wonderfully clean, sharp pictures, and much easier to use than the 7d was.
image quality
easy to use for canon users
fast accurate autofocus. 10 frames per second when using a fast compact flash card such as the lexar pro 1066x 32 gb. build quality . image quality up to iso 400.
it simply is the best aps-c camera i have ever had to date, money well spent.
good af for tracking moving subjects, bif etc.  easy to use menu system, rugged build quality.
great image quality and focussing.
takes excellent photos. useable iso range vast improvement on 7d mark 1, less noisy.
better  noise control

very happy with the faster shutter speed and also the iso range. although heavier than my last canon, it feels comfortable when handling.
everything
an iteration on the previous eos7d with a number of useful additional features and some changes that were clearly a result of experience. good value at the current simply price
lapse timing.
great auto focus and tracking of moving subjects.
very fast great metering
fantastic focusing - image quality is wonderful.
quick, quiet and good image quality
great speed of focus
superb image quality. the ultimate apsc camera
this was an upgrade from my 60d. though i havnt really got out to use it. from the quick use, it's a really good camera.
fabulous build quality
a well constructed product and far superior to the original 7d
overall, a very intuitive camera
wireless connectivity
gps. focus system
focus system excellent.
all round brilliant
superb camera, loads of options , pleasure to use.
fast, precise af, excellent vf coverage, 10fps. auto focus at f8. better at high sensitivities than expected, fully implemented auto-iso, high iso noise is easier to deal with than it was with the 7d. can share batteries with 7d/5diii, feels very well built. very similar to 5diii in use. extra reach with long lenses.
this is a great camera for if you want something a bit more high spec than your standard compact, but aren't yet of a level to get the best out of a big dslr.
amazing build quality, great compact size yet still packed with features. reports of a terrible auto focus are unfounded it might not be best in class but its more than acceptable.
great all rounder
small and compact when used with the 22mm f2 lens, shots raw
pro image quality
same image sensor as the mid range eos lineup (600d etc), same interface, (but with touchscreen), great size, looks beautiful, good weight.
quality build. even with the 18-55mm lens it can still fit in a jacket pocket. with no viewfinder you get used to it. a smart little camera that packs a punch!
value for money.
well built, easy to use. can use all my eos lenses using the adapter.
quality product at a great price.  got a package deal which was very good.
the flash is removable so during the day theres no need to carry it with you. the quality of the screen is great and takes professional looking photos without the need for a huge dslr.
small and compact, good back up camera as you can use your large l series lens (with a special converting ring).
very impressed on the night mode!
easy access to main features the sliding screen is very useful and makes altering the settings easier to use.  fairly light weight to handle does the job that i needed it for.
love it!
great picture quality.  extremely easy to use.
as a professional photographer i never thought i would get such superb quality from a point and shoot little camera. so much easier than the top of the range cameras i use on a daily basis. i just whip the sureshot out, press on and go. given me so much pleasure and i've only had it 2 weeks!!!
this camera is an excellent choice for a second camera when its not convenient to carry a full frame slr camera with you.  sturdy construction.  nice to have optical viewfinder as live view is dreadful in bright sunshine.
it has everything a dslr has but smaller.s
excellent features with this camera. good to have a view finder as well as screen.
max aperture f/1.8.
good image quality
excellent low light ability
bayonet for extra accessories such a filters or closeup lens etc.
fantastically lit viewfinder. shots in poor light are so very easy. lens is a joy to use. camera does most things my hi-spec nikon slr will do
quality built
love the real viewfinder - so much better than using an led screen. controls are excellent. easy to use
great camera, user interface easy to understand, fantastic as a back up to my dslr
everything that a dslr can do without the bulk and an exellent manual override too.
i haven't had much chance to play but stick it in auto and away you go.
solid feel and positive shutter response. compact size so easy to carry around but image quality for a compact camera is excellent.
good pocket camera when the dslr is just too big.
great size in the hand. picture quality outstanding, video a fantastic to.
i really like this camera and it has many functions and settings.  the auto is great for folks who just point and shoot - but
since receiving the camera i have not had much time to trial it but what little i have done i am very impressed with it. pictures taken on auto are well exposed and colours balance, useful to be able to download images to my computer without the need for cables using wifi. build quality is very good and apart from the optical viewfinder which could have been bettered with frame marks to mark out the aspect ratios i am well satisfied.
excellent useful controls.
very good image quality
- good macro capabilities
compact size, great images,
low light and fast shutter speed alongside build quality
good size, quick and easy to turn on and use. very good night time mode, and firework mode. good in low light. wireless upload.
easy to use, brilliant professional looking picture quality without the knowledge. at the price i paid, why would any one consider anything less that the canon g16
fairly compact will fit large pocket
like the controls so don't have to use active screen for menu.  fully automatic but with option to use manual controls.  good in low light situations.
simple used
just a great camera for its size and price
high quality feeling, good pictures, nice automation and manual options
fast to activate       good quality image
weight makes it portable so that can easily take out on walks etc.
good image quality, control options, reasonably compact.

camera was everything, i was looking for, professional pocket camera
good all round camera
very good image, focus. and precison.
good dark area images
early photos look brilliant
excellent picture quality
so many features in such a small camera.
previously had the previous model 's of the same camera. never had a problem till my last cannon  camera when the lens would not go back, i had had this previous cannon for about 8 years without any other  problems the photo's were brilliant,
small enough for a pocket and has all the usual canon controls found on my slr plus some useful presets and good quality video.
easy to use
good all around camera
all round good camera easy to use and access all the features. image quality is good and great for travelling. not a camera for the amateur, good for the intermediate photographer and those who want to learn more on the manual side. great build and feels solid. a 58 mm filter adapter can be attached for those arty shots. i simply love this camera and carry it every where.
very bright 1:1.8 lens, little smaller that the g12 its replaced, battery is smaller, lets hope it lasts as long. has wifi (though not used as yet) fast start up and shutdown.
nice compact with manual functions
slr like features in compact body.
easy to use
many excellent deals out there will provide a superb value for money camera.
reasonable view finder

ability to take good photos in poor light
amazing lens. features for multiple shots
great quality on images.
reall really lovely pictures and so easy to use thrilled
it's also very easy to switch into macro mode for those detailed shots.
a compact camera with a viewfinder and the ability to over-ride the automatic settings
so easy to use, although it came without a user manual a download version was easy to obtain and use.
fast focus. high iso
without doubt the best camera i have ever owned bearing in mind i worked for a time as a professional photographer. i genuinely can't fault the camera...
the canon g16 is a fantastic camera all round . great for in door use in low light.
but the service i received was top quality i would recommend this company to family and friends .
i just love this camera. it is packed with features and suitable for all occasions. i have only taken around 100 photographs so far, most of them in outside conditions at night and am very impressed. low light photographs are fantastic, many can be taken without even using flash.
the sharpness of the image is excellent and the zoom is brilliant
excellent camera
good solid feel
fantastic technology!
excellent balance between size and performance.
hotshoe and tripod mounting features are standard.
super camera - easy to use
value for money is good. big features in little package.
i've had canaon g series cameras before and this is the best so far.
very  easy to use
low-light performance and apparent reliability
shoot with enough to make it my slr buddy. good in low light.
excellent pictures. the usual good build quality of the g series
for a pocket camera i get remarkable results.
size : image quality ratio
ease of use and great functionality
viewfinder and  wireless
it's very light and easy to use
only recently received what i have shot so far only heightens my expectations.
the best price i could find!
the quality of the photos are fabulous
sx210i as this g16 is so adaptable and easy to use.
brilliant camera this has replaced our canon g9 for underwater photography mainly. great picture quality and navigating around the camera is much easier. the one button access to video is a vast improvement.
looks very good so far but these are early days!
good quality compact thats more like a dslr and perfect for travel
easy to use and quality of pictures wonderful.
compact and high quality feel
good all round compact camera
i am certainly no photographer but this camera was recommended to me.  it is simple to use, fast to take the picture and lightweight to carry.  so far i love it.
so happy! :) exactly what i wanted.
great camera for the price
it has every thing you could really want in such a small camera - terrific
takes raw images. has a viewfinder. light and seems durable. perfect addition, between my slr and ixus.
very high quality compact camera.
good price
robust build quality
it is difficult as so far i have had limited use of the g16 but this is not the first g series canon i have had.
settings all easy to access and manual controls make using the camera quite slr like.
fast focus, access to all controls ie exposure,shutter, iso etc, good build quality, good image quality.
also, use of the camera is simple and straight forward
image quality
nicely built feels superior to other similar cameras
great features, especially the fact that you can shoot in raw.
exceptional image quality for the cost, very technologically advanced.
optical viewfinder, good lay out of buttons and dials, meany features as found on dslr,sn
easy to carry round without the bulk of dslr but with all the control over the image. not a substitute for dslr but a brilliant travel camera for the keen photographer
the camera feels solid and well built. i have not had it for very long but have been able to easily do the things that i want to with it. i like to have an eyepiece to take pictures especially in very bright and very dark conditions. the wifi is great allowing me to have a good view if my pictures on an ipad long before i am able to get home. continuous shooting is impressive.
quite small compared to slr and fills gap for quality images  between compact and slr
compact easy to use good picture quality. good for travelling light when slr too bulky
excellend second camera. professional quality of pictures.  my first camera is canon eos 7d.
this is simply a fantastic piece of equipment - will take weeks to figure it all out
excellent colour balance; tack sharp images on my 28-300l; focusses real fast; menu system easy to understand, set up and use. build quality is excellent. image quality is excellent, better than my 5dm3 (which is excellent), a lot better than my 7d. this is the best camera i have owned, i wish i had bought one when they first came out.  i use the camera to shoot kids football tournaments, which involves lots of action, group and individual shots; very often taken in testing weather conditions, changeable light from one direction to another, even clouds and shadows on the pitch. i have no hesitation to recommendthe canon 1dx camera to a friend.
brilliant camera, fully professional, amazing quality.
built like a tank, superb in lowlight amazing focusing system
built like a tank,great af system and low light ability highly recomended awesome machine
fantasic camera
everything
the top of the line - slr cameras don't get much better than the 1dx.
best camera on the planet.
excellent iso, and af
great quality and features
brilliant quality in very low light and quick to focus.
a great camera, still to really put it through it's paces, but all good so far.
it will blow you away in lowlight conditions.
dual digic 5 processors, iso up to 204.000, 12 frames per sec/14 with adjustments.
image quality at low iso.
built like a brick and image quality is top rate.  the camera is used mainly for macro and sports photography.  the ability to really push the iso value and get good usable photographs is a really big plus point.
amazingly fast shutter speed when needed
fast and beautiful
an amazing piece of kit, within an hour of receiving it i was comfortable enough with it to use it for work!
great sensor in low light
price
touch screen, tilting back screen
image quality for both still photos and video is excellent.  the feel of the camera and the grip is very good.

we bought this camara to use underwater in the maldives and it did what it says on the box
it's a very nice, sturdy, good looking camera.
went down to 25m and it took excellent pictures the deeper the better the picture for the money you can not go wrong  i love this camera
recommended once set to english!
easy to use. down load easy for manual. it is waterproof. good supply from simple electronic for battery charger included with various plug requirements. good screen visibility under water. easy to use zoom. easy to access movie mode. menu easy to use under water. results were good when visibility was good.
haven't had a chance to test it under water yet (which is why i bought it). but as point and shoot, you can't go too far wrong. great little camera.
robust
acceptable image quality bright, clear screen
easy to use also fot beginner. great value for money compared with others brand of cameras with the same specification.
amazing all rounder
takes good quality pictures both in and out of water.
great camera. bought for the water but great for everyday use as well.
just come back from egypt. the image quality has been fantastic. really pleased with the camera
underwater use. loved it when diving
the sort of quality i expect from canon.
great for scuba diving as it is small and doesn't require a case.
being waterproof
i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
fab pictures brilliant buy
facility brilliant, but not mentioned i publicity blurb. neither is the fact that it has gps location built in.
ease of use, waterproof down to 25meters making this compact digital camera a very useful diving camera, either in still or movie mode.
easy to use on land or underwater.  underwater particularly good, producing excellent pictures with good colour compensation.
solid, compact build and seems to cope well with light conditions underwater (tested down to 20m so far).
very solidly built and very suitable for traveling in remote places.

underwater use. loved it when diving
the picture quality is good.
excellent video.  good low light performance
no camera shake,  sharp image, wide angle lens, good battery life.
low noise level, especially in dark. image quality is good for such small camera
very easy to use; good quality pictures
i have to say canon 300hs is amazing and excellent working but the price is some how high and also it is delicate  but it is worthful in buying my point of view u can njoy the experience.....
low light facility.
i bought this to go along with my slrs but haven't used them since!
best camera i\xb4ve ever had. just love it!
very small camera nice to keep it in pocket all the time.
easy to use and takes great images
the quality of the picture is very good.  small camera so perfect for carrying around
excellent performance in low light conditions. intuitive easy to use controls. robust build quality. extremely good picture review facility.
a very good piece of tech for the aspiring photographer which is well worth the money. offers great quality pictures especially in low light environment (when upgrading from compact cameras) some very awesome features which allow you to boost your creativity. the 18-135mm offers an adequate zoom for general purpose use. overall a great dslr i enjoy using.
great dslr camera  with a high quality lens worth the price. easy to learn for a beginner with many advanced features.
comes with a super and high quality lens which is really worth for the price your paying. plus the camera body features like the touchscreen display is suoer handy for fast focus points and to find various settings fast.
image quality
i have wanted to move up to a more sophisticated digital camera but am still a novice, i found this model ideal as it is easy to use with many functions to experiment with, would recommend to anyone wanting to become more experienced in photography.
great size weight and of course image quality
does the job that i need it to do and produces cracking photos.
everything!
easy to take great pictures and can learn to take even better ones with advanced settings.
really good build quality. easy to get started and get some great shots
great piece of kit
as a first dslr, this takes great pictures, is easy to use and the  18mm -135mm lens gives good flexibility for near and telephoto shots.
a very good all round dslr and good value for money, especially with the 18-135 is stm lens. i've been doing photography for 50 years and purchased my first canon eos slr (film, which i still have)) 15 years ago, the lenses and speedlite flash i have are compatible with the 700d. if you want 35mm full frame size like professionals use,   you'll have to pay a lot more money. the 700d is a good enthusiasts camera with good choice of modes so that beginners would have no problems using it. the 18-135 is stm lens is quiet with non rotating front element which is great when using polarizing filter, i'm very pleased with this camera and lens purchase and would recommend them.
very good unit for beginners, highly recommended
very easy to use and excellent picture quality. i need more time to explore this amazing machine.
fantastic value for money and very easy to use.
nice kit for starters or even for the more advanced user.
easy to use and good quality images. not had opportunity to use all features yet but pleased so far
bought this for my daughter as a christmas present, and she is very pleased with it, also bought the 'dummies' book to go with it as this was easier to find out how to use it than the instruction booklet that comes with it.
image quality is the best i have seen on any camera
fantasic verstatile camera with two lens in one basically
haven't used it in anger yet but i am very happy with first impressions
great low light performance. good quality video. the 18-135 zoom is much more useful than the 18-55.
image quality very good
modern up to date camera while not forgetting what it's for..image quality excellent i had a real problem deciding between this camera and the nikon d7100 . reviews tend to say nikon for proper photography and the 70d more for video. well i looked into them till my head was spinning and i made the choice to go with the 70d based on the live view screen and the image quality not for how good it is shooting video witch seems to go against the recommended comparasons as i'm am into still photography..all i can say to help you is i am really happy with my choice the focusing is fantastic the kit lens 18-135 is also very good and the camera is very easy to use the menus are easy to use and set up the buttons on the camera are easy to reach and give quick accesses to the main changes that one would need. the live view fip screen is outstanding just like using a smart phone. the built in wifi was very easy to setup and use.
in built spirit level is a nice addition
this is an outstanding camera and the 18-135 lens is excellent. i have been amazed at the enormous difference between the 70d and my old 500d. the results at iso 6400 are unbelievable! no noise at all. highly recommended and saved over \xa3400 buying online from a major high street retailer.
sturdy, convincing quality for the most part. an excellent choice for someone like me who is not a pro but have taken photos in earlier life with an analog camera. there are more features than i'm likely to use, which can, in a way, be taken as a good point (alas, the price effect).
flip screen is great on and off a tripod. very very fast focus - brilliant
* hot shoe mount for mounting external lamp, shot gun or stereo mic
many of the new features solve a number of difficulties using my eos 450d camera.  church interiors and landscapes with dull white skies will show detail in stained glass and clouds.  touch screen valuable for ease of focus on non centred subjects.  a major improvement, with trhe possibility of simple use for beginners, leading them to add extra skills as they need them.  fantastic to be able to leave my camcorder at home.  i'm hoping to leave my backpack home next time we go on holiday, and just use the cameras and the kit lens.
good lens , loads of things to get to grips with, but just on auto its great
easy to use, good video
great product
the wifi connection to ipad is really useful to review images on the go.
i haven't had the opportunity to use a (d)slr camera for some years, but this was comfortable to use from the outset.  i have picked up the features very quickly and know that i am going to enjoy using it with the lenses i bought.
all good so far
not sure yet
easy to use straight forward. quality build
low light shots very good and the auto focus is amazing
3) a great price compared to the high street
the auto focus is brilliant and performs very well in low light
dual pixel / focusing
it even displays the batteries power for each battery.
easy to use, excellent quality
touch screen, touch to focus, af system
once i got my head around the controls the results were excellent and well worth the effort
ease of use all controls are to hand and images are brilliant(this was a christmas present so only a short time of use)
excellent articulated touch screen. great focusing and low light performance.
its canon
wifi is a + in this model. very fast @ 7fps and the 19 focal points are very useful
touch screen controls
did what it said on the can
guaranteed to enhance your skills as a photographer!
it's a canon! :)
easy to handle and the image quality ans well as the features of this camera are amazing
early days yet, but so far, performance appears excellent. i was also very pleased to find that my old ef lenses work well
this camera is amazing. i still have a lot of things to learn as the spec. is so much higher than what i am familiar with.  the canon lens..ef-s 18-135 is stm also gives amazing results. they both compliment each other. very pleased with my purchase.......
good prices!
very easy to handle even for first time users of dslr
still geting used to this camera and i am very happy with the result. the video focusing is great even in low light so i find this camara very good .
well balanced camera that sits comfortable in the hand with all controls ergoniomically placed
much less noise than my old 40d.
fits great in your hands, image quality, ease of use
as far as i can tell since i bought it recently and i used it for a few shots and brief video, it is a leap forward in mp and clear images. i have the 40d which is great but the 70d makes adifference.
great af
amazing quality, excellent for those looking to step up from the entry level canon slrs. never been so excited by a piece of technology!
fantastic upgrade from the eos 1000d. plenty of features and it feels more robust. looking forward to trying this out soon!
lots of brilliant tech features bringing this up to date from my aging 40d !
easy to use - touch screen - video feature is also good. fast response times. almost perfect!
super fast processor and great image quality - very good layout of major controls and a hugely versatile standard lens that covers everything from landscape to portraits
great image quality, feels sturdy and not over heavy, perfect for wildlife with its 1.6 crop factor..
i have only had the camera a couple of weeks and still trying to find my way round all the functions but can find nothing negative to comment on at this point. if possible i would have gone for the 5d but given the difference in price i think this is a great buy and value for money.
multicharger.
perfect replacement for my ageing 40d, all my lenses work on this body plus i can now take video clips with tiny dof.
i'm just a keen amateur and this camera is everything i could want. the picture quality is outstanding, and i'm enjoying using it.
wi-fi built in
the autofocus of the lens included is wonderful, it preserves the color even in dark, difficult situations.
to find fault with anything, but the composition of an image is more important than needle-sharpness in most cases. but this outfit delivers everything you could reasonably expect!
tracking during filming
features which can only be followed
telephoto lens is superb.
i already own a canon eos 600d, but have developed rheumatoid arthritis in the past year, which has made it difficult to hold or grip for prolonged periods. i bought the eos 100d because it is smaller, lighter and potentially easier to use. this has proved to be the case and it is now the favoured camera; with the appropriate choice of lens, the balance is even better. the outfit came with a free spare battery and a free carry case - a great bargain.
touch screen is a nice little extra - definitely not necessary but some features are great, like scrolling/zooming images and quickly changing manual settings.
which includes an ef 75-300mm lens. which really makes for a fantastic value package.
you will notice a big difference moving from a compact. fantastic camera overall.
the touch-screen that activates taking a shot is so wonderful, it fits my idea of modern-day  photography.  i can make the lens focus on any point i wish, even if the subject is a small one.  it sort of creates a zone-focus field.
the touch screen makes it easier to switch between pictures. if you aren't keen on manually setting the settings then the landscape, portrait, sport, etc is fantastic. with auto focus there's no need to fiddle with focusing on your subject.
excellent pictures even on the fully automatic mode, and simple to use.  much more possible with experimentation with all the different modes and settings.
exposure brillant
light so easy to carry
easy to use, compact, great image quality
bought it as a package with telephoto lens and really good camera bag, excellent value!
handy for easy photography but equally capable of more complex work.
small, light and easy to use. as a novice, i already had pictures which look like they're straight out of a magazine on the first day.
all in all, great value for money and solid enough build to weight ratio.
finally much lighter then other models.
love the ability to click click click without noticeable storage delay
an ideal starter kit for the budding photographer. we bought this for our 13 year old daughter and she has had hours of fun. lots of great features. worth buying a bigger lense to maximise it's full potential which we did. the lense cost as much as the camera. worth it though as the results have been stunning!
use on auto for a start to help get the feel of the camera, then gradualy use other settings as you gain confidence. images are very good, although when you first start experimenting different settings you may have some pics that are not perfect, but it takes time and practice.
this was the best value for money bundle around !
don't think that because it's cheap it won't perform well. this is an excellent camera.
super light and very portable - it fits into my handbag. really easy to use, cheaper lenses than nikon, a great entry level dslr.
good dslr camera. would recommend to anyone.
this is my umpteenth canon and 2nd dslr. i suspect that like most people addicted to slrs the key things for me are ease of composing your pictures and the power of the lenses. this is a beautiful camera and an amazingly quick and quiet lens. i may never use some of the more advanced features because i just like taking pictures and it does that with great simplicity. image stabilization is also great on the new lenses, i also bought the 70-300 usm, awesome.
size, frames per minute, iso range and very easy to use. amazing at this price.
lighter and more compact than other dslr cameras without compromising picture options and quality.
touch screen is fab
it feels nice and solid. i have wanted a dslr camera for a long time and this one has not disappointed me.
as my first digital slr it is very good. the compact size means you do take it with you and it is then available to get those special shots a compact would struggle with.
excellent camera.
light
easy to use
great starter camera for a serious photographer.
good mix of pre-sets and creative
easy to use camera light and small for a dslr
everything
the camera is do light, still so full of features, that i wonder if i will remember all (that's a positive point too me) but it does not make it complex to use. full automatic mode will give you the greatest pictures.
great easy to use camera, giving excellent quality picutes.
size
i like the touch screen, works just like my phone, with pinch, swipe etc.
recommended.

light
size, ease of use, quality of product.
small and light, great image quality.
takes great photos.
bought because i have problems with my hands dexterity, thought being small i would be able to handle camera better than a large dslr model. initially was still a problem but am now finding my way round the camera, so it was a good choice.
easy to use camera with excellent picture quality. the smaller size makes it easy to hold in your hand
small footprint, standard lens connections, all manual and auto functions, loads of features, excellent image quality, built in flash and hotshoe, excellent build quality, great value for money,
great photos, easy to use.
all good all round slr
it's small and light to carry around

small,good looking,excellent pictures
light, compact camera with good build quality and outstanding performance.
feature is excellent, particularly when photagraphing fast moving objects. the camera is easy to use and user friendly.
the camera is fine , dealing with se was horrendous , they lied , i needed camera for best friends wedding , they promised me it within 2 days , i got it 20 days later. i am in process of writing to all camera clubs , and papers to make everyone aware to keep clear. also when you do email them , they ignore it and send you a mail back trying to get me to buy other products. disgraceful way to treat someone!
all good. its a great camera for beginner
easy to use.  good features for a beginner
perfect for a beginner and still then again it does excellent job for a mid range dslr
overall a good camera for the enthusiast.
very easy to use,lovely shots.
great
image quality
it's early days, yet, to really extol its good points. the important thing - it's a camera that does what you expect it to do...give you pin sharp pictures, every time. i've yet to fully appreciate its different programmes. a 300mm telephoto lens came with my deal. i'm looking forward to getting good pics of birds at the nearest rspb location.
enough information to help you along the way
but early to tell yet but seems great.  need to do online tutorial which came free with the camera.  using autofocus at the moment.
easy to use, good weight and grip
east to use, great images and excellent value.
it's very easy to use and it doesn't weigh so much like the other cameras.
easy to use, like the app that comes with it for smartphone. lightweight camera with great photis
i like the freedom of the manual settings, plus you have the fully auto mode
i have very limited knowledge of cameras and photography but have got some great shots with this camera. its easy to use and the app that comes with it offers greater understanding so i may even take it off auto setting!
there are no bad points with this dslr, easy to use. i would also advice to do download app and it shows you how to use the lens and key features, that you may need when taken a shot.
easy to use but has all the professional features you would expect
ease of use, feels solid
reasonably easy to use and understand.
an excellent camera and great value for money. there's plenty of online help too either via canon or users of this camera on youtube or other sites. i purchased 2 additional books which included the dummies guide. this camera is ideal as a first step into professional photography, or just for general use as there is just one single single setting which i call idiot mode - you can't go wrong!
easy to use. excellent value for money. great companion app.
great value for money, easy to use, great for beginners after having a bridge camera
easy to use
intuitive to use with the added benefit of the rear screen showing which mode you have selected.
simple to use and ideal for a beginner looking to step up from a compact.
the camera works well and is a good starter for my daughter
a very adaptable camera that can do just about everything including video.
still early days of using this camera but so far very happy
the camera
great camera! easy to use straight out of box, would recommend for first time dslr users.
simple to use, with very useful app. bought for my daughter, and she's loving it. she's taken some excellent photos!
for a novice this is an ideal camera as it offers a 'halfway house' for those of us who know nothing about photography through the modes it offers where you can make slight adjustment and see for yourself the impact the change has on your image.
ease of use
versatile, with raw as well as jpg
simple; easy to use. and brilliant lenses
perfect entry level camera for budding photographers, i bought this for my 10 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!!!!
my daughter had this as a christmas present and is thrilled with it, perfect for her alevel photography wor
the camera has a small footprint and is light for a dslr.
i find it difficult to rate, as i have upgraded from a compact camera, and am still finding out about the new one.  so far i am delighted with it ( i got a good deal in the sale) and my daughter who is a professional photographer, says it is perfect for me.
i got a great camera on sale which made it even better! good for people who are into photography but dont have the money to spend on a crazy expensive camera when you get everything with this one!
you can literally just point and shoot. the pictures are fantastic.
good for the beginer to intermediate level
one of my hobbies is photographing aircraft and the ease with which i can centre my target is  very good. it is still early days and when i have used it more i will be better placed to judge it properly , but at present i am well pleased.
it's as easy as ... point and press !!!
great autofocus and quality of pictures
great entry level dslr camera. can't recommend it enough for the price.
nice size . not to heavy.
i am novice so it all seems great to me!
easy to use, great value.
everything - lovely camera
excellent beginners camera. lens supplied is decent for a beginner.
great camera to get you started!
it has video now and big increase in picture resolution.
a mostly easy to use dslr camera. the battery seems to go on forever; giving you the freedom to concentrate on getting the perfect shot. the lens it comes with is great for close and mid range shooting. slightly heavy but you soon get used to the weight and well worth carrying it around on your neck for the photos it produces.
good alround camera,easy to use and it's canon at an affordable price.
take quality pictures of the night sky.
the lenses from our old canon (spool type) fit the new camera.
easy to use excellent picture quality for an entry level dslr
very easy to use and work out different features. great pictures and very happy with size of camera
my husband is over the moon with this camera. he says its easy to use with more features than his previuos camera
i purchased a sx700hs instead as the camera came with a 30x zoom and didn't have too many lenses to carry around. the canon name though should make the product shine.
great product.
easy to use
it's  made by canon
nice entry level or caual
it is light, quite fast, has 1080p video recording ability and is cheap. all in all it's great value for the money.
all good
i havn't used my camera much yet, but i am very impressed with it. it was brilliant value for money too. i would recommend this cametra.
excellent picture quality and very good value for money
enjoying learning how to improve my photography.
everything just so easy.
i love how easy it was to start using and produces lovely pictures.
easy to hold and use.
canon app helps you use the features for beginner
it has some good things you can download onto your computer that gives good results
easy to use good starter slur camera.
i love everything about this camera . i would recommend this to any one
found it really easy to good with good quality photos.  very happy with the camera
only had camera for a month but so far i'm very pleased with it, it is everything i hoped it would be. good value but without losing out on a good camera. i'm just learning to use a dslr camera and was unsure whether to choose this one or the more expensive next level up, but am very satisfied indeed with my choice.
good entry level dslr
love  everything about camera
its so easy to use if you have never handled a dslr before.
easy to use and produces great photographs.
good quality pictures
also has a helpful app for your smart phone
like the overall product
very good camera had a great deal on it well worth the money,good for beginners and professional starting off.
very easy to use and the free companion mobile app is very helpful.
when you first view photos taken with canon compared to camera phones and one shoot style of camera the detail depth of field stands out and brings extra lasting value to the images taken
ease of use
picture quality
very good camera for a novice. great value for money especially with the special offer available at time of purchase.
it has the capability of taking video clips
very good camera, like it a lot
i bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it.  she's found it very easy to use and is taking lots of lovely pictures including a close-up of a fox.
my daughter loves her camera, it's really easy to use and she's taken some fab pics with it!
great camera for a first time dslr user
i bought this camera for my son and to say he is delighted with it is something of an understatement.
easy to use
so easy to use with great results. by far the best camera i have used
good value deal - 2 lens and bag included.
fantastic support through app for phone. easy to use for beginners good start point
there are better cameras out there but at a much higher price i find the eos 1200d easy to use and without having years of experience had great results straight from the beginning if you're coming up from a compact or a bridge camera then i would highly recommend the 1200d and there's a lot of help out there to make sure you get the best results.
easy to use , quality pictures good value for money
love it
good quality pictures
versatility!
very easy to use and certainly user friendly.
i am still learning but this camera makes it a joy and i hope that my photography improves to match this great camera.
excellent camera
being able to use my phone to control and view picures is excellent
very crisp clear pictures. big improvement over eos 450d. fantastic live view. fast continuous shooting.
i thought the button layout would be hard to get used too after using the 600d for a long time, however i was pleasantly mistaken an it is a joy to use.
touch screen functionality, wifi with free iphone app, intuative design and menus (for existing canon eos users at least)
fast focusing, excellent handling, high frames per sec shooting (ideal for sports)
touch screen, excellent quality. clear menus
slightly lighter than my eos 40d,focusing  much faster using my tamron 16 to 300 zoom lens. simpler to use,didn't think i would like the pivotal lcd screen but was pleasantly surprised.
many features and options that will take sometime to appreciate and decide as to which ones can be used in the type of photography one undertakes. is wifi enabled. need to have correct types of lenses to use with this.  (i can use the lenses that i had for the 700d.)
features found on a more expensive camera
this is a fantastic camera which is excellent value for money...
picture quality so far
a great camera for video,it was the reason i bought it.
great features, wifi works great with my ipad. superb handling and excellent image quality as always from canon.
everything
the 70d does everything my last camera didn't do. i particularly like its wireless connectivity.
fully featured and highly flexible camera
probably the best crop sensor canon body currently available.
image quality and touch control facility
i was considering the 7d mk ii but as that lacked the wifi, swivel and touch screen and was \xa31000 more expensive i decided to buy the 70d instead.
touch screen, articulated screen, easy to handle
this is a superb camera for the money, much improved on the 60d.
easy to use once you get the hang of it
so very pleased on it's first outing. it didn't let me down
good quality video. solid build. good range of features.  outstanding images
vari  angle touch screen
i upgraded to this after using canon 600d for 2.5 years and i must say this has been a good change. the touch screen, back dial makes it so easy to use. the 19 point af system is a blessing.
touch screen really good
a really great camera.  touch screen technology makes changing settings straightforward.  excellent image quality and wide range of features.  a brilliant all rounder.
nightime handheld (scn) scene mode works very well (no need for flash, uses 3 images)
so far every thing works. good quick focusing, sharp pictures after not to much computer manipulation, that's if you like sharp pictures. a little smaller body than my 50d. wifi works well saves plugging in or taking out sd card.
viewfinder visibility and new focus screen very nice
i'm a seasoned cannon camera user, but it will take a while to get to grips with all the features this excellent camera has. it is great to save money and waste by being able to use the lenses i already own.
generally good and easy to use, had previous canon cameras and this follows their lead.  the slaving of flash is easy and useful in creative photography.  wifi works but is not the easiest to use.
i've only had the camera a short while, but so far it's a great investment and would recommend
the touch screen is a good development, didn't think i would use it but it is definitely easier and quicker then scrolling etc with the dials
able to use my i-pad to view photos and operate  the camera. ease  of use improved over my 60 d.
such an intelligent bit of kit, very impressed with all the features it offers over my previous 500d. not had much time yet to use it but can see the potential it offers.
fast, comfortable in hands, positive and responsive to adjustments and changes in settings.
i am biased because i have always use canon and would recommend highly for anyone who enjoys their photography and is relatively serious about it. i haven't spent time yet on my new canon eos 70d and so can't really add a list of good points but having been using the60d for the last few years i'm sure there will be a few.
it's a present so no comment
good when shooting in low lightnings
having had a chance to use it on trip recently, i was satisfied with my purchase.
much better focus and quick set ups.
great camera, speedy, excellent image quality, wireless operation +++
the best digital camera i have ever used, it is very versatile, all modes easy to access and use.
excellent video focusing.
now includes video and a 20 mp sensor over my old 20d body. can still use all my canon lenses.
high iso rating, fast repeat shots for action
the lcd monitor's ability  to flip out and rotate is most helpful.
camera is awesome
i love this camera. killer features include in camera hdr and multiple exposure. spot on focussing and it fits in my hand like a glove.
i haven't been out a lot due to other commitments but so far i am very impressed with it
this was an upgrade from a 700d, and wow, what a jump! the tech in this is just amazing, the features are so much improved (raw editing, extra photo filters, like tilt shift) and the extra buttons on the camera means you can control with a lot more ease of use. one of the best upgrades i've ever done.
simply perf
i bought this camera for my husband who is very pleased, he finds it quite easy to use having had a previous canon and thinks it is an very good camera. our daughter, a professional photographer (children/babies mainly) has used it several times whilst out and in her studio for clients photoshoots and is very impressed with the results.
excellent update on previous versions.
the touch screen is very useful and the speed of recording the pictures is fast. picture quality so far has been excellent.
canon 70d is an excellent camera. fast focus and the bulit in wifi and the touch/swivel screen are useful features.
the touch screen
zooming, processing raw pictures, video, pretty much everything
superb image quality and ease of use
low light sensitivity cannot be beat
not had any problems so far, brilliant product.
innovative focusing system.
excellent hd video.
great feel good features easy to use
love the touch screen for checking images and focusing
the flip out screen makes a huge difference when shooting at lower levels
a fantastic mid priced canon eos camera that takes beautiful crisp images.
still getging used to it but its very good im pleased with the camera so far
probably the best canon available for s lenses.
such good images
night image processing
compact, articulated touch screen,
af zones, high resolution touch screen lcd
excellent camera with all the features you could want from a professional camera but at a much more realistic price
just as you would expect from canon
very good low-light performance with high iso settings. superb af.
overall good looks and feels like quality in your hand
quite easy to use if you have experience of using a dslr before.  it is fast, compared to my old camera.  it is also comfortable to hold and i am very pleased with the image quality.
fantastic camera
good camera but i need to learn how to use it !
auto function means you can take great photos straight away.  learning about all the many features though is the best bit and will leave auto mode in the past.
4. pictures can be seen on smartphone via wifi
new af points and micro adjustment
after my 600d it has so many more featuresand getting into them takes a bit of time but there is usually more than one way of getting into the setting that you want. the controls are all pretty easy to find once you have got the layout. very pleased and don't regret buying.
touch screen
tilt swivel panel for live view, wifi, ease of use and powerful multi-point auto focus
touch screen and wifi.
nice and heavy, well built, solid, robust, professional feeling.
touch screen - much more usable than anticipated.
a grip of right handle
autofocus is very good. its a big step forward.
machine with good quality, very good functions. who comes from a 600d, 700d will be rendered.
great specifications
fantastic feature set.
flip screen
packed full of features for the enthusiast.
fantastic piece of kit.  love the wifi features, controlling with iphone is great and wireless transfer of images

it is lightweight and the controls are easily accessed and conveniently placed.
superb camera, wifi is awesome.
overall excellent performance.
usual canon genius an absolute must have camera for this price
amazing af, touch screen
dual sensor, touch screen, picture image
if you have use a dslr before the touch screen you will find a wonder and so much quicker.   great to handle  no complaints. shoots so fast you will need more sd cards lol
easy to use easy to get to know brilliant bit of kit
fantastic camera , full of features with great image quality.
really good quality camera
tilt screen very good, easy to use.
the sensor is far better quality than previous camera model (previous camera was a 650) pics great quality
an excellent dslr with superb features.  extremely fast, great image quality and well put together.
good in low light conditions
awesome
excellent fast and accurate focusing
superb build quality.
unbelievably good performance in low light, significantly better focusing system and many small, but important improvements compared to mkii. based on quick experiments, also the white balance seems to be working better.
i did have to wait a while fr i to deleiver however most definetly worth it! and same regarding the cost! it's a lot of money however for my line of work it is definetly worth it!!!
dual card slots
both output images and build are top quality - there's a lot been written by the professional pundits about the mk3 and it seems they are spot on with their assertions.
would definitely recommend this.
excellent image quality when paired with the right lens, simple things reasonably easy to accomplish, works pretty much like other canon camera. intricate interface with a lot of functionality. does however work out of the box. rich full colours, sharp focus, good tracking [when you set it up right!]...
full frame sensor with crop frame speed. this is what the mark 2 should have been. excellent af, and dr.
low light performance
if you have used  the canon 7d then you will be a home with this %d mkiii, great camera
lightweight (compared to 1ds, 1d etc.)
fantastic quality and features, worth the money.
the immediately noticeable improvement is actually the fantastic viewfinder. it just seems so much clearer and brighter. and the build feels even better than the mk2. i also have to use nikon's at work but for me there is no comparison in terms of logical layout and menus.
auto focus system.  image quality.  low noise even at higher iso. build quality.  so much to like about this camera and it's great fun to use.  a great step up for anyone wanting to go full frame.
better placement of buttons. very good weather sealing. the real-metal-body gives a wonderful quality feeling. new screen and 100 % of the picture is showed in the view-finder. the electronic level help is really useful especially in darkness and the auto-focus system is just so much better than in mark ii and also the different case mode for ai focus is excellent!
it's an excellent camera, image quality and focusing wise, as good as one could get without going to the expense of the 1dx, can be straight forward to use but if you specialize as an amateur photographer as i do, like wildlife mainly then the camera has all the versatility one would need for almost every situation, especially low light condition now with the high iso and low noise image quality, the focusing on the mk111 is significantly superior than the mk11and better than the 7d, excellent build quality to! in my opinion it has everything you could want from a camera whether its wildlife, sport, weddings or just home life.
beautiful quality, easy to use, excellent af system!! great buy, though a big jump in price!
hi iso - lo noise
image quality , build of camera
much better focusing than mk 2.  dual cards, burst rate
build quality, light weight,the silant mode is very good
superb build, great image quality and an all-round brilliant piece of kit.
much less noise in low light than the previous model
control of the groups of focus points is simple, easy and quick to change.
low light shooting is much improved focusing is fast and 6 frames per second is super for nature and sports photography
everything can be adjusted to suit your shooting environment or artistic taste.
had 2x 7ds quite happy with them but the 5d mk3 i am very happy with and will be getting another
it has all the pipes and whistles anyone can ever wish to have. it is solid and well built. innovative features. great picture quality.
image quality is fantastic, focusing system a big improvement, ease of recording motion work is good.
image quality,focusing ,build,and the low light shooting,all the controls in the right place.fantastic camera.
just research your product and make your own mind up ,i'am happy with this so its all good ,enough said.
image quality, features, build quality
too numerous to mention, but the ability to set the dof button to switch between ai and one shot is worth the upgrade from mark ii on it's own!
af system
greater depth of field for same distance to subject compared to crop sensor
this is the ultimate camera, i have worked with crop sensor cameras for years but the image quality of this camera blew me away. it is so pin sharp, the soft shutter release is perfect for wildlife photography and the extra af points makes it so much more versatile. the build quality is as you would expect from canon and the redesigned shell makes it easier to hold. the rear screen is crisp and easy to view in all light conditions.
where do i start.... it's fantastic!
autofocus drastically improved from the 5dii.  also the higher iso is even better.
big step up from the eos 5 mk i i was using, just as easy to use but quicker focusing, sharper focusing, excellent image quality
the quieter shutter is way better than the mk ii
this is the 2nd one i have bought. these cameras are top notch..
we use these cameras in our book scanners because of the speed of download, excellent colour image quality and the ability to have complete control from a pc.
like new button layout
best of type camera - excellent all subject all situation full-frame camera with very good image quality.
familiar product, great workhorse camera. i like the mirror lock-up facility. shutter release is very soft compared to the mark 1. af variations are excellent and the controls are in the right place for me. the menu preferences in my menu are very helpful as i found that navigating through all the options time consuming when in the field. there maybe a shorter method but i have not found it yet. battery life much improved. like the level facility on the information screen. not really used live view as yet so cannot comment on this. camera not bought for it's video facility but i will have a look at this in due course. like the dual card facility.
fantastic camera capable of taking high quality shots
image quality is great
i cannot say as the camera cannot be used because the battery is faulty, therefore score of 1
ergonomic, light, magic focusing system, very fast, long life battery.
always a canon man, fast, good handling full of features.
am very happy with the product and the company that sells it.fantastic deliver.
having upgraded from the eos400d this camera feels and is much heavier. however the moulded grip is so much better so that you feel you have a solid hold on the camera. in fact you get the impression of a solidly built camera. easy to start by using the full auto mode
fantastic camera moved up from a d5 so l have to get my head around the new layout .the images are second to non hi definition good for cropping in photoshop.
easy to use  and i love the camera so much i now have two !
headphone socket hdmi out
improvements from mk2
excellent construction. terrific images.   good functionality.
huge improvement in af over mkii
autofocus is outstanding. a very complete camera.
good in low light. allows all features of 600 ex rt flash guns to work properly.  excellent focusing options.
super camera from cannon
* silent shutter
can't doubt this product. love it.
inbuilt hdr, very easy to use, and results are very good
price and robustness
great features for film as well as photography. well built with some nice improvements on the already great mark 2.
excellent camera, read all types of reviews and tests before buying.
not recommended for anyone who does not have extensive knowledge of serious photography prior to purchase.    unbelievable auto-focus system, but easy to get wrong when quick change is required.
excellent build quality
coming from canon d550 the 5d iii lets me gets much more out of my lenses: 24-70mm f2.8, 70-200mm f2.8, 50mm f1.2, tokina 11-16mm f2.8. like they are made for each other (which is of course, but a bit surprising for the tokina). :-)
video functions and quality
amazing quality. incredible low light and iso response. best value dslr on the market.
loads of features
image quality stunning. just done my first wedding shoot with it and got much higher proportion of keepers
its just an amazing camera. stunning images. easy to use the basics straight off, but the menu on the 5dmk3 is getting very busy with access to many features that probably will never get used so a bit of a shame they cant be hidden away. saying that its probably just a case of getting used to them. the main thing though is this camera is one of the best cameras on the market today.
multi point focus
easy to use until you can master all its applications
excellent camera
professional quality equipment and images
noise proformance, iso proformance, 64 auto focus points and 41 cross type, i know they don't state this but this camera dose to 60fps video.

a high quality system camera with excellent backup both from the manufacturer and independents.  build, performance and operation are all top class. close to the cutting edge of modern digital photography, it is very nearly as good as it gets at any price and very difficult to fault in any meaningful way.
great upgrade from the mk ii
photo quality

larger rear screen
an amazing piece of technology that lets you take great shots, can you afford it, buy it immediately
image quality is stunning, feels like a professional camera.
fantastic functionality
great camera. i've upgrade from a 5d mark ii and thought about a 5d mark iii but i'm very pleased i went for the 6d. i read david clapp's blog and that was good enough for me to buy the 6d. excellent camera with lots of features.
very easy to operate. great performance. great picture quality. havn't tried movies yet.
easier to use than my previous 50d much better pic quality
silent shutter
best dslr on the market for its price
wifi
beautiful to use. much easier than my 100d. takes lovely pictures at high iso speeds. great for candle lit scenes and early morning photo shoots.
ease of use , well built and plenty of features
awesome quality at low light scenes, low noise, best value for money full frame camera
was between the 6d and 5d mk iii but im glad i chose the 6d. image quality is super and the high iso gives you new possibilities that in my 650d didn't even dare to do. highly recommended full frame camera.
compact body that feels really light and solid. large bright viewfinder, uses sd cards.  close to 5d in picture quality at half the price. focussing in very low light.
fabulous camera and extremely high image quality.
full frame .  wifi...gprs....love it
sensor,  canon compatibility, features, latest tech advances, lightweight, price.
* wireless use of external flahes (off camera shooting).
and classing myself as one of them i'd say it's all the camera body i'll ever need.
if you want a great camera with most of the features of the 5d mk3 then this is the camera for you
good compact size as i have small hands this is a big bonus for a full frame
perfect
silent shutter sound, quick and easy exposure adjustment, weather proof
clear screen. easy to use. great quality images

amazing camera, good value for the money.
excellent camera and good value. works well in low light.
gps
overall
good priced entry level full frame dslr!  well built with enough automation if you want it but fully customisable for those who want to explore their creative side.
my old 450d was pretty good, but i knew it was not getting the best out of my l lenses. image definition is breath taking on the 6d!
wifi + gps
good build quality  -- great images -- easy to get into hdr.
great viewfinder. excellent image quality. good colour rendition. easy to customise. nice to handle. very quiet and smooth shutter release.
the price looked good
many improvements, small and big, over original 5d.  quiet operation, speed and hdr are some examples.
a well designed and built camera with a full size 35mm sensor
camera is canon 6d
easy to use full frame sensor lightweight to carry fast enough focus
ideal as a step up to full frame.
full frame sensor at an affordable price
awesome image quality and beautifully built. stunning low noise in images even at iso 10000
good entry level full frame camera offering good detail in the images
massive difference in image quality in comparison to a crop sensor. viewfinder is beautifully clear and bright. takes and bit of time to get used to the layout after using a different camera but still more intuitive than a nikon
given excellent results
settings
the image is high quality in low light. it's light weight. best camera for portraits, weddings, indoors, and landscape.
will be able to assess when current problem sorted
picture quality
i like the way layout of the button is made.
i bought this item after having the eos for only a short time. the difference is incredible.  i bought it mainly for the low light settings as i am a gig photographer  and i am delighted with 5he difference.  a huge step up from 5he 7 in every single way. i 5hough the 7 struggled badly to even focus in low light.....this one does it with ease.
low noise, wi-fi, full frame
just fantastic, especially for the price. more than suitable for a good number of pro jobs; don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
great image quality.
full frame.  good iso . simple menu. weight.  size. canon reliability.
full frame at reasonable price. low light performance excellent for astrophotography.
shooting in dark, amount of noise at high (3200-6400) iso . ...aaaand taking photos in low-light conditions. smallish in size for a full frame camera.
small, light weight body with powerful imaging!
the image quality is very noticeable crisp and clear compared to other canon models that i own. i intend to purchase another as a back up soon
i bought it for the wifi features and improvements over my original 5d. thrilled with the results and extra features.
im so happy with it all!
light weight, good for travel, good build quality, easy to use.
an amazing camera - so happy with the purchase
still exploring it....
great taking shots at low light conditions
screen views for camera functions allows speedy choice and access.
full frame with good price, image quality
excellent full-frame body especially in low light.
a really good buy
very high iso settings without losing image quality, info screen on the viewing screen full frame picture
i really love it, it's a real little beauty and very good value for money.
its a 5d mkii with better low light capabilites.
light weight, quiet operation, fantastic quality
definately value compared to mkiii,and full frame is different from crop sensor, i would advise keeping a crop body though for long lenses.
great feature. when using it does, feels like quality
image quality is stunning. the body is small and light for a full frame camera. handles nicely and a joy to use.
i bought the eos6d to replace an eos7d; the latter had occasionally not functioned correctly in recent months.  as a full-frame digital slr i already knew that the image quality from the eos6d would be much improved.
amazing, excellent low light images.
gps, wifi works well with my mac, good image quality, smart feel and build quality
great resolution, fast autofocus, lightweight, good build quality
still getting used to using it
raw image quality which i use 99% of the time.  for me, used to the eos system it is a great camera.
easy to use, works just like my slr but much smaller and lighter
quick in response and taking amazing quality pictures
the big bonus with the camera is its picture quality which is very good even in comparison to my  dslrs.
compact. great image quality especially in low light. love the touch screen, especially the ability to use for shutter release.
tilt screen with addition of the evf
i have only had this camera for 3 days so far it is excellent.
canond7 used .easy to switch between camera,s.brought         ele veiwfinder with it great pieces of kit.
access to the full range of canon lenses via the included adapter
before i purchased the 70d i thought i would not use the touch screen much but instead i have found it very useful especially zooming when reviewing images. i have experimented with the wifi and expect as i get more familiar with the camera i shall use this more. the results from the camera are excellent. i have just returned from the ve day airshow at duxford and am really knocked out by the results.
excellent  camera for the enthusiastic amateur photographer. allows for excellent auto shots yet creative auto adds more control of picture outcome without getting complicated.
really user friendly- on screen instructions of what some of the features are. moveable screen to allow ground use, wi fi option is brilliant as images can be sent to smart phone and camera can be controlled by smart phone
phase detect auto focus in liveview is true innovation from canon...beats contrast detection hands down and is very useful for auto focus during macro photography, videos and any kind of fast moving action (watersports).
image quality
very intuitive, excellent features, well designed.
love it
excellent size and the focus is pin sharp.   very fast processor in camera and amazing pics even in basic shooting modes
superb handling. too many more to mention.
very easy to use and great picture quality
great image quality on a camera under \xa31k
easy to use and produces excellent pq. so many features to use and excellent for a fairly confident amateur to try a more professional type of camera.
very good camera!
good quality. touch screen is nice
high dynamic range in the scn setting is very good.
excellent balance and feel
early days just getting used to the upgrade from my eos 450d. image results excellent great buy.
lens feels well built and solid and has a smooth feel when zooming.
an outstanding camera and lens package. image quality is excellent for both stills and hd video. user friendly with a host of features that would satisfy both the amateur and professional. the facility to fire speedlites off-camera is a really useful tool which saves spending a lot on the canon st-e2 speedlite transmitter. i can fully recommend the canon 7d and 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 is usm.
although the camera its heavy, it feels balanced and robust in your hands.  the buttons are well placed even for my small hands.  camera responds well even in cold weather.
really pleased with the 7d, it has to be the best in its class. image quality is fine and gets much better when you upgrade from the kit lens the the l series.
the higher fps cf the 50d gives me a better selection on the action shots and invariably i get the shot i am looking for. a very good camera.
i have no hesitation in highly recommending both camera and lens to anyone
amazing image quality, and the inbuilt wireless flash control is really useful for external lighting. the new viewfinder overlay is incredibly useful, as is the increased number of af points.
great image quality and user friendly interface.  camera and lens combination feel well balanced in the hand.  very useful focal length range equivalent to 24mm-136mm on this body.   lens image stabilisation performs very well.  great battery life and very fast auto-focusing.  built-in flash very useful to have.  (more expensive professional 5d and 1d series do not have built in flash so that's yet more expense to buy a flash gun.)  useful bundled software including eos utility to control camera via computer.  overall, a highly recommended camera, full of features, but don't just take my word for it. do your research and read/watch some of the hands on reviews.  if you just want to take snapshots it will do the job very nicely, but there are less expensive models which will do equally well.  to get the most out of this camera it is definitely worth reading the manual and also to turn the dial out of the automatic modes. {;\xac)
this is a camera that will give excellent photos at the touch of a button or complete control over the final results.
i bought the eos 7d as a replacement for my ageing eos 350d and have been blown away by the features and the overall quality of the camera.  you have to spend time with the manual exploring all of the options then it all makes sense.  the best features are the quick menu to accessing all those things you use most of all, the user definable menu, the large lcd screen and of course the is lens which is a brilliant 'standard' lens for this amazing camera.
excellent camera with superb build quality. top end picture quality..features are excellent once you familiarise yourself with all the functions.. this camera is defo not for beginners .
great camera, easy to use and great results
after reading the other reviews, i was looking forward to getting to grips with all the new setting and the steep learning curve that i have heard about but was disappointed as it was not much different than my 450d and at first i didn\x92t think the picture quality was much better ether, until i compared the shots on exactly the same setting 450d v 7d the difference is tremendous and the 15 / 85 mm lens that came with the camera is excellent.
for an aps sensor the quality is stunning and the high asa images are quite superb. i'm very happy.
great camera can\x92t find any faults
very capable camera/lens combo of doing just about any photo shot you want. its an expert camera for those willing to read the manual and learn it. no matter what level you are, be prepared to study, practice and learn before you get the hang of this fine piece of machinery.
a outstanding engineered piece of equipment
fantastic camera all round. i use it for wildlife (my passion) and people (because i'm considered to be a reasonable photographer with a very good camera). the wide angle lens is of great use and high quality. the aps-c camera sensor (that collects the light for the photo) is smaller than 35mm which results in a magnification of the picture so that a telephoto lens gets you closer to the birds. the down side is that wide angle shots require what would seem to be an extreme wide angle lens. this lens sorts the problem well and is good value when purchased together.
i am a newbie to the dslr and i find the 7d very user friendly, i have not used all the functions yet but i have took some very good photos which i was very impress with, the 15 - 85mm with 7d is a perfect match for allround photography and it's very good for getting started with, i am happy with my purchase and learning more and more things everyday.
i am over all very impressed with the camera.
the camera is even bettter than expected. the lens is really good: extremely fast, very quiet, and sharp. very clear lcd display.
excellent focusing
8fps gives you a sensational touch in composing photos, you can use this art of machinery however you like.
excellent camera, can not find anything negative about it. the only deficiencies are in my knowledge but i have bought this camera to step up in my photography and it is definitly helping with that.
image stabilisation and image quality.
all
as i've only had the camera for a couple of months it is all good while i get to know how it works ;-)
like all canon's well put together and having used one all others are easy to use.
how much canon is been advanced to make photogarphy to take out from complication.
all
it's fantastic , the 1d mark 4 is the only thing that's batter

stunning image s  a very good camera
excellent piece of kit. only just purchased so with anything new it seems complicated, but i'm sure it will become clearer. so far build quality is excellent, viewfinder size very beneficial.
excellent handling, fast response, viewfinder 100%, well layed out controls. metal framed body.
so far all good
does all i want and more.
shutting speed
very good quality, excellent pictures.
stability, af system, image quality

been wanting a new slr and this fits the bill , if you are looking for a new one this i would recommend .
a well made camera with very good features.
upgrading from a 450d, this was like a little slice of heaven. i didn't realise i needed an upgrade until i tried this camera. the low light conditions i work in are a breeze for this camera!
low light image quality, and touch screen option
quiet shutter, stunning images, lots of features, great locking system, touch screen
movable screen, is. capable of very high speed.
an excellent camera pitched only just below the 'pro' range but much less expensive. gives everything a pro camera 'needs' without the expensive added bits that, to honest, are just gimmicks to justify the pro price-tag. a super, full-frame camera!!
5d mk3 picture quality in a smaller lighter package.
video quality good and so easy to use.
very good camera.it do what you want.
an excellent full frame camera at a very reasonable price. fantastic 24-105 kit lens

it's just great for stills. fast, sharp and great quality of image.
the lens gives excellent image quality and is versatile enough for many different subjects. the body is solid with a great viewfinder and low light performance is better than average.
camera was well packed, but have not had a chance to fully test it's performance as the manual supplied was in japanese. on contacting customer services, their approach tends to be to get rid of you, rather than to solve the problem. very unhelpful.
good in low light. quick and reliable focusing. full size sensor. feels solid and well made.
robustness.
easy to control camera from smartphone using  eos app, in camera hdr, combine multiple images into a single photo, wi-fi transfer images to pc , great image quality, great quality l lens
low light focusing is brilliant.
full frame, nice gear!
the canon 24-105 lens is outstanding and out-performs the 24-135 in every sense.  the extra 30mm is neither here nor there.  the image results far outweigh the extra length
it's just perfect and cheap!
superb piece of kit
light weight full frame
happy with iq, good iso use, minimal grain

great ease of use, camera and video footage a+
wanted to buy a good quality digital camera, easy to use, for a weekend to see the edinburgh tattoo.  quality of photos were excellent and the video images were also good.  bear in mind i am an amateur, so to me the photos were very good.  easy to use, but i just selected auto mode, as i only had the camera one week before my holiday.  i know that there are many feautures available, which i am unable to use to full potential, but i am enrolling on a short part time course to learn more about digital photograpy, so hopefully will be able to take better shots.
large touch screen which is very easy to use.  lots of different picture options (colour accent, colour swap, miniature etc.).  good zoom.
highly recommended as a convenient to use, high-quality image-maker
easy to master
compact, lightweight. is very versatile because of its size. very well built. it has a very high specification but is easy to use.
feels good to hold - reasonably easy to use without looking at instructions - i have had it for awhile and not had time to read the book and i am pleased with the photos.
so many features - had the cannon  xusv for years, which did me great service but this is in a league of its own!  so many facilities i can't name them all here, as though i got it for xmas i only started using it saturday for my granddaughter's birthday and i was just picking it up as i went along, but think i need to sit down and read the manual as i don't think i'm getting the best of what it can do at the moment.
personally i haven't found anything bad with this produdt yet, if there are any.  i received it as a gift from my husband for christmas after my old canon of approx 10 years gave up on me.  i find it so easy touse and i particulaly like the fact that i don't need to put on my reading glasses all the time to make sure i am doing the right thing.  with the large screen it is so easy to see a good (or bad) picture and the controls are very simple.  yes i would highly recommend this for a lightweight camera giving ease of use and very good pictures.  bear in mind thought that it does not come with a small memory card to get you started, you need to buy one at the same time.
special effects
superb photos, and great little camera.
ease of use
easy to use and excellent image quality in all conditions
everything is perfect .
it is easy to use but it takes a little learning curve to get the best results. the camera has a lovely look and feel and had a few compliments when i asked strangers to take photo's for me.
i bought this as a present for my husband who has a technology phobia, but he has found it really easy to use and the picture quality is great.
good battery life and display changes are almost instant. overall a much better model than the ixus 130.
lovely photos, really intelligent camera. great to have a separate auto function then at a flick of a button to be able to load your favourite mode as well - e.g, i can have an 'auto' colour mode, but then switch to black and white in one click, as opposed to scrolling through the whole menu.
easy tu use and pictures are of good quality.
quality build plus up-to-date technology in compact form
lots of features, image quality very good, build quality very good.
the camera is so easy to use,i am not a great camera person but this even makes me look good. viewing your pictures is great because the colours are very good and clear.i took a long time to find the right camera and with this i know i made the right choice.
nice features and hd video very good for small device
size and ease of use
pleased.
canon ixus 210 is the bes camera on the market

easy to use. lightweight. excellent zoom capability.
like everything but i've only had it a few days, still learning
the 24/600mm zoom lens
raw + jpgs

the quality of the images even when using the zoom up to 30 was excellent. no camera shake at all.
easy to use, handy perfect bridge camera. good value for money
very comfortable to hold - much more so than my original little powershot camera. have printed off the manual for ease of use - the clearest to understand manual of any piece of equipment i have ever purchased and well indexed. haven't had time yet to explore all features but so far am very pleased.
happy with this purchase. will certainly recommend to a friend.

i am delighted with my camera and accessories. thank you
have only taken about fifty trial photos in the week i have had it, but found it easy to set up, without downloading the manual, and easy to use.  every function is spot on and the resulting images have been great.  i have not used the video functions, as i only use a camcorder for that, so i cannot comment on that aspect or whether the biggest criticism of the battery iapplies or not.
have a trip to canada coming up , looking forward using the full zoom, without the bulk and cost of an slr with separate lenses.
excellent camera with lots of features and superb zoom.

i have just upgraded from a previous ixus which served me well and decided to stick with the same brand.  it has not disappointed. i wish i had bought it sooner! very good pictures and so easy to use.  i totally love it !
accomplished little camera.  great for slipping in your pocket.  lots of features - probably too many if all you want to do is point and shoot.  12 megapixel prob too many but great to have the option.  photo quality very good.  wide angle great too.  perfect on a holiday to iceland!

very compact and easy to use. excellent picture quality for a camera of this size and price.
although i bought this product as a christmas present for my son, i know that he likes the features and got the hang of it quickly.  i personally also use a canon and would always recommend that brand.  the ixus has also several fub features that would appeal to anyone who also uses photoshop or similar computer programmes.
looks cool.easy to use,soft wear easy to follow. lots more!!!!
so easy to use, very clear photos, much better than my previous camera (nikon coolpix) and the 'kids/pets' setting is great for taking photos of my 'non-stop' toddler! great size for the handbag, good size screen.
as with all canon cameras very easy to use.
easy to use.
good camera
slim but stylish build and ease of use make this a must have for the point and click brigade. had the equivalent olympus previously and find this a much better product.
small and easy to operate
'auto' setting recognises things very clear/easy/quick. battery lasts long, very good movie capture and can record long depending on card size. 8gb sdhc card was more than enough no probs at all.
excellent light weight camera, easy to use with good quality images.
so easy to set up and use and such good value.  my grandaughter was takng good quality photos within minutes. (i'd charged the battery before i gave it to her).
easy to use, nice compact camera
small
this is the third canon ixus as i like mine so much, i bought my daughters the same camera. i have had many cameras over the years but this one is superior. friends have purchased the same after seeing the quality of mine.
a great pocket camera with substance and style. easy to use with great quality images. may be a bit on the small side for very large hands but ideal for nimble fingers. uses an sd memory card and a lithium ion nb-6l battery which are easy to source for spares.
has a good solid feel, truly recommend this camera!
fits in my handbag so i take it everywhere.
needed to change camera so picked this one.so far i am not disapointed,but need to get used to the small size.
memory card.  this is better so i am told.  seems fine to me.
an excellent camera easy to use and very light would easily fit in your pocket if you wanted, picture quality is great and a rechargeable battery what more do you need.
easy to use. compact.
big screen,good images
very easy to use and i don't do gadgets.  light enough to keep in your bag.
great compact camera.excellant quality pics
really pleased with this fabulous little camera.
so easy to use!! this is the second canon ixus i have had and therefore i am probably biased!!
small, light and easy to use.  so far haven't had to recharge battery but then it hasn't been used excessively.  i carry it in my handbag at all times.  i'm really pleased with this camera it replaced another one (not canon) which always seemed to have a flat battery.
a small compact camera, easy to use.
smart handy camera
had an ixus camera previously and as the function set ups are similar it has proved very easy to use.  the large viewing window on the back is great.  battery life is good and it is a re chargeable battery which is always the best bet.
quality is good...........
ease of use
easy to use and understand, buttons easy to push.
easy to use and fits in your pocket. bought it for my mother-in-law and she loved it.
ideal camera for what i wanted - something not too expensive as i won't use it often, but looks good, built well, easy to use and takes good photos and videos in auto mode. i had used this model of camera at my office and liked it, so got myself the same one.
a very good compact digital camera that's easy to use.
ixus 105 - i found the camera easy to use, the instruction booklet was clear and easy to follow.  i have only experimented with shots so far but pleased with the results. lots of detail on close up shots.
the camera is small well balanced and fits the hand well. simple enough controls for all the family to use and simple to download via usb or card reader. we have 3 canon ixus in the family and an slr because of the intuitive nature of the controls and software.
love the camera.  it is so easy to use, and the pictures come out so clear.  i really like the large screen to view your photos.
quick to start up, excellent pictures
zoom
the camera is very good! it is easy to use and produces great ppictures. my daughter has a canon s-90 which is 3 to 4 times the cost of this one, and the 105 produces very comparable pictures.
this really is a great camera for the money
awesome zoom lens and very easy to take good quality pictures, indoors and outdoors - and i've hardly started exploring the additional features
excellent image quality, great zoom, great high iso / low noise.
easy to use. menu option also has brief description of the relevant functions.
amazing zoom needs stability as you would with slr with equivelent zoom. having raw is great, thats what clinched it for me.
having been a press photographer for over 40 years in fleet st i can say that if i had this camera before i retired it would have made life very much easier.the lengh of the zoom is just fabulous and the picture sharpness is amazing for a camera at this price.even at the full 1200mm its great and plenty good enough for newspaper work and takes away the need to carry a heavy and very expensive bunch of lenses.i would recomend to anyone considering this camera to go out and buy it.
fantastic zoom range,clear handheld pics of the moon!great for close ups of birds etc in garden.good quality of pics,excellent macro.screen rotates to any position
this is a great camera, i have got a lens adapter ,so now i have uv lens ,lens cap, and lens hood this is 58mm adapter, , you can also get adapter that has 67mm thread ,the adapter is the most expensive, ten to fifteen quid ,which is no price to pay to protect the lens,the other bits were no more than three quid each,  from ebay,pukka magnification, nice compact well made, canon are the only one for me
lite compact, very good light filtering, good anti shake, easy to ujse
image stabilisation for hand held photos even at full 50x zoom (i've turned off digital zoom) is good.
great zoom lens and best value for money
a very good bridge camera for an enthusiastic amateur photographer.
multi functionality, lightweight, optical and digital performance, features.
light weight good size and good build quality.
small and light enough to carry around, huge telephoto range, good image quality and fast focusing at maximum telephoto range.
it has so many great features there are too many to list. you just have to read up all it can do. the lens is the widest range i have used and i am a professional photographer. i just wanted a smaller camera to cover everything in my travels. this fits that and more.
lcd screen and super zoom.

no obvious delay between pressing shutter  and taking picture.
good  tele lens and small  size and value
simple to use
the sx50 is a great camera. it is a camera which i can take anywhere, not too bulky for travel. the image quality is amazing and it is probably the best camera which i have ever owned. delighted with it and would recommend it wholeheartedly. some reviewers seem to have had issues with the eye level viewfinder but i have found it good to use although i took some time with setting the dioptre.
canon camera is just awesome, incredibly luminous and powerful telephoto lens. the software very easy to use and the interface is logical. for me, the real surprise was the viewfinder, the accuracy of the adjustment. i like the camera really.
nice and light - great features - great zoom with great results
everything about this camera is fantastic
wanted to photo birds so the zoom is good ,the camera lightthe tilting screen is handy for plants no getting down on wet ground.still getting use to camera but so far very good.

all good

i took some photo's of the gibbous moon last night, and i'm absolutely astonished and delighted with the results.  i used a tripod, but left the camera on automatic, without flash.  it's my desktop image now! fantastic!
light weight, controls at easy reach, extensive range iso, high mag range ideal for wildlife
it is light compact with the eos quality photographs plus it has a cam corder also
back in again image quality good zoom size huge 1200
this is my third canon camera, although my first bridge camera, and  i am completely happy with all the functions, especiallly the tremendous zoom capability, easy to use after downloading the pdf instruction manual, many of the functions are similar to my previous cameras which made it easy to follow. all round good value for money bridge camera.
zoom is 50x and the camera is light to carry compared to long tele lenses.
fantastic product, incredible value
this is an excellent camera, and the price was good.
a great step up from the sx40 hs with the addition of the larger lens, super vivid colours setting and the ability to take hdr photo's.
i have never taken such amazing pictures, even with the zoom, which incidentally is amazing. i have yet to explore a lot the features but expect great results.
excellent 50x optical zoom.  very good image quality.
easy to use, but worth reading the manual thoroughly.  a bit tempting to use it on auto.  very sharp images, even at night.  image stabilization excellent.  super zoom, in every sense.
its a good all round camera .i took some pictures off the moon thay are fascinating..thay are so good no one believs me.i have the canon sx40hs from value basket its good now the canon sx50hs is very very good it does all that i whant

i bought my canon hd 50x  bridge camera immediately prior to a very special three week holiday in asia and did not have time to familiarise myself with it beforehand.   set on auto it was very easy to use and the 50x zoom is excellent.  the image stabilizer works a treat even when taking photos from a moving coach.   this camera exceeds my expectations.
having used or owned most of the bridge cameras available during 2014/15 i can say that this camera although now superseded by the canon sx60 hs is by far the best camera for outright image quality nothing else comes near it, images are very clean at 80/100 iso  and are still usable upto 800 iso, the image stabliser is excellent as is the focusing.  other cameras may have longer zooms but its not much good if they then can not deliver a clean (low noise) detailed image.
easy to use, bought as a christamas present for my 13 year old son.
zoom lens and wide lens.x
outstanding zoom
staggering zoom, big screen, general ease of use
so good i bought one for my son and fiance
takes great, clear pictures, lightweight and looks good
point and shot on auto
i heard good reviews of this camera and bought it on this basis. however, once i started to use it, i could not fit a protective lens filter to it. the camera shop said this camera cannot have a lens filter because it has not got the thread for a lens to fit to. i was disappointed.
too many to list
fantastic range on lens for a small camera
easy to use from a idiot's point of view but can be excellent with a modicum of effort
light, conforms to other canon cameras operation and layout making it easier to use immediately.
fantastic love it
the zoom lens
everything was great.
easy to use menu and to find way around the screen
light, good looks, lots of features, gr8 quality pics.
very flxible configuration, excellent lens and good battery life.

good clarity even at full zoom.
brilliant phto's and the magnification.  wow !!!!!!!!!
it is ok ;-)
used for bird photography, easy to use, excellent picture quality with identifiable images even of distant birds
amazing camera - i love it :-)
excellent quality photos, superb zoom
great for bird watchers
50 x zoom with excellent is, a very good point and shoot if you do not want to take your slr

100x digital zoom amazing, nice features, good lens
all good
good sturdy model.
great budget camera!
~good upgrade from standard digi camera
great camera with lots of features and great special effects
fantastic zoom easy to use. everything's easy to get to from holding position. my first top quality camera and got the hang of it quickly.
the zoom is incredible for a bridge camera and images are clear and crisp. great price and great camera
good camera when first starting to take more proffesional pictures gives plenty of scope to see improvemnet in picture quality.
zoom for such a small camera
very large focal length range. lightweight and compact.
just so impressed with the camera, my last bridge camera was a nikon p100, in my opinion nowhere near as good.
zoom, image quality, battery charges separate from camera
good zoom and a good replacement for my previous camera..canon powershot a80.

perfect dice of a camera for a safari that is for what i bought it for. very light, the zoom is amazing.
simple to use and yet comes with a wide range of features that can be gradually explored and introduced into the range of images taken
the zoom lense was the thing that imprest me most and the quality of the picture when using the zoom. there were now bad points as far as i was concerned.
absolutely thrilled with the powerful zoom
works really well.  it's good to use, light and effective.
its taken my images to a new level.
easy to handle, ease of use, picture quality fantastic and zoom power excellent .
has everything i wanted in a neat little compact package! great features, great quality.
being a digital camera, it is excellent video capabilities
one very fantastic compact camera
the image quality is really fantastic.
nice compact, easy to use, but good image quality just what i wanted from a compact camera.
like all the other cameras in this digital ixus range that have preceeded this one, it s a wonderful piece of workmanship. it takes really great pictures, is very easy to use and is packed with useful functionality that takes its capability way beyond the ixus 850 which i was previously using - and still use alongside my ixus 1000.
many features, versatile, good image quality
good zoom range and lens with stabilization to back it up
optical image stabiliser, low light multi-image facility, excellent hd movie quality, 10 x optical zoom
i bought this camera for my 6 week trip to south america. it has great features and image quality is fantastic.
good screen size, zoom and features. also slow motion at 240 fps.
the zoom is excellent and you get all the beautiful images you can expect from a canon.
love all the funtions in manual mode and my partner is able to use the camera in auto
zoom
small, easy to use
great low light pics, easy to carry around, pretty fast back to back for what it is!
zoom range combined with image quality is why you'll buy it
canon products are great - very easy to use
super slow motion video very good for improving my golf swing.
excellent product all in all. ui is easy as this is my 2nd ixus.
an exceptional camera from canon. i like the function where it will takes 3 or 4 shots and then decide which to keep from the selection.
quality of image
great canon quality, reasonable price, usual canon standards and ease of use through the menus...
compact, large screen, easy to use,stylist,well built,reasonable video
easy mode is so useful for beginners
excellent picture quality, great zoom and focus
ease of use
for the price, this is an awsome little snapper that fits in the pocket well.
relatively cheap. takes sharp photos in good light.
canon are definitely the best camera in my opinion. the picture quality and ease of use is awesome! wouldn't buy anything else.
this ticks all the boxes
lightwieght to carry but lots of features and easy to use
it's a great little camera that punches well above its weight.  it is easy to use with one simple dial if you want to 'get tekkie' with it, but the auto feature really does do everything for you.  the pictures are fantastic and i love it.
quality of shots is fab.  ease of use and to carry.
easy to use
lovely camera
fantastic camera and suberb pics
light and easy to use
excellent selection of programs to help get the best results. very good zoom lense and a good video facility.
handy and light weight.
excellent photo quality, brighter than other cameras (even in low light conditions).
simple to use, great shots, ideal for taking pics in a holiday as it is small and light! great camera!!
great value for money. very easy to use.
not had enough time with the camera. but it is a learning process
very happy
easy to use, very useful having a rechargeable battery
all the good points of my previous canon camera with a few of them
lovely pink colour!
light to handle, size easy to put in bag or pocket, nice and light.
small - fits easily into pocket/handbag.
compact, simple to use, good picture quality
really great little camera, excellent image quality.
all as above
it is easy to use and light to carry around.
light weight easy  to use.
really like this camera, it is small light and takes good pictures, i use it as a point and shoot and haven't even read the manual yet but just loaded the card and batteries in and used it.  very happy with my purchase.  nice big screen and so easy that my 5 and 3 year olds can use it as well and take a reasonable photo.
compact, very sexy, image quality is great, video is awsome and the wide angle lens really makes a difference. just tried the digital macro this morning: a view down a drinking straw... brilliant!
- big screen
small size, face detection, automatic shooting mode detection ... ... you name it...
excellent picture quality, ease of use, sturdy construction
looks cute and sleek, easy to slip into a pocket
small and easy to use
simple to use, good range of features

start up time
nice feel to the camera
great quality in all aspects.
camera is easy to use in programme mode, with all you items you can alter easy to access.
great wide angle lens
you get a 7d at half price, except the pro features like weather sealing, 8 pic/sec, focus micro adjustement...but do you absolutely need those ? and you get a swivel screen, which the 7d does not have ! so you can shoot your hd videos without having to look through the viewfinder ! precious if you want to film from the ground or overhead and still have a perfect composition!
it was a close call between the eos 60d and a nikon d7000 and i'm so glad i opted for the eos 60d. superb build quality - nice and solid. the image quality is fantastic - even in low light and having full hd video is a real bonus. i didn't think that the swivel/tilt screen was going to be much use, but after using it i believe it'll be the norm for dslr's very soon - very useful.
the top lcd screen makes it easy to adjust settings without the need to enter the menu making continuous picture taking easy.
this is an upgrade from and eos 400d. i prefer to have a larger heavier camera in my hand and this suits the bill. the flip out screen is great, especially when used for low down shots. control of the camera has taken time to come to terms with but that is to be expected when changing cameras, this being the only reason why it scores 9 rather than 10. the increased number of setting menu's allows the camera to be tuned to your own needs and the ability to save these settings is a good feature. this is a great camera for stills and hd video recording.
everything ! i moved up from a canon eos 400d, yes i know its 4 years later with plenty of more gadgets and features but the technology crammed into the camera is little more than amazing, processing on board digi4 processor, vari angle lcd and hd movie recording, i just bought the canon lens 18-135mm and grip for it and the pictures are totally amazing in low light........ go and buy one you will not be dissapointed.
+ ability to create a custom setup for quick access
seriously good low light performance.
excellent camera. a reliable friend in the field. i'm not leaving home without my canon 60d.
ergonomic; great image quality; excellent hd video; nice interface design
great picture quality at heigh iso.
ease of use,handles well.flip screen is whats been missing in canon cameras.
comfortable shape.
very good camera for the money, and canon have done well with the 60d. fast, and the images are great for the sensor size. if you want a decent backup camera, or are new to photography then this one is for you!
must be about as good as it can get with a crop sensor. its really good.
having recently purchased the eos60d  i am currently testing it in the rockies on holiday.i have the eos40d with me also and find that the 60d is giving me sharper faster shots especially where time is of the essence.the eos 60d is quieter to use on those times when silence is needed and knowing that the camera has been weather proofed was a blessing when a large heap of snow fell from a pine tree on to me and the camera . an acciental drop from four feet also proved another of the camera's merits.i am, so far, well pleased with its performance.
brilliant camera.  great features, easy to use in both auto and manual modes.
really like the build quality and image capture of the 60d.
picture quality
great feel. the fold out screen is brilliant and in future would want this addition in any future model purchased. this addition should not be under estimated especially when taking macro shots.
* the fold out screen is a huge point for me
plenty of settings to play with.
great quality images. very easy to use controls and interface. hd video is a plus, but not as good as a dedicated camcorder for casual recording.
everything is just great!
flip out lcd screen
very light and stronger than steel
very versatile camera body especially when coupled with a canon efs 18-200mm lens.
the camera.
nice piece of kit great to handle and the features are easy to use to. would recomend to anyone.
nearly everythng about it
very good camera, lots of good features. with free angle lcd screen, it will help you become more creative photographer or videographer.
nice and easy camera to use and i do love canon products
excellent dslr camera, providing brilliant images.
well build all the buttons are nicely ergonomically placed. swivel and tilt rear screen helps when taking shots at difficult angles.
the flip out and rotate lcd screen
very easy to use (double coding wheel) and great image quality.
everything that goes with a canon camera
this camera is quality. i've used many different makes and models over the years but i would recommend this to my family and friends. the quality of the prints says it all. not really been heavily used yet but i'm sure it will be in the future.
robust, comprehensive feature set.
value for maney
good value for budding photographers. manual is a great help and canon website also good for help
the fold out screen is a huge bonus particulary with macro shots. i cant understand how more expensive pro cameras do not have this included. image quality is superb and if you are a canon user the layout should seem familiar. upgraded from a 400d and the difference is enormous. like other reviewers i have no need for video but it is there so maybe in future it will get used?
i am happy with this camera.
movie
great image quality, hd vidoe is amazing when used correctly. its a canon dslr.
filters and mini effects let you edit pics on camera  if no pc available
nice camera to use
easy to use as i already have a canon camera and the controls are very similar
the camera is great
huge range of canon lenses to choose from to use with this camera.
its a great dslr, perfect for filming and taking photographs. good value for money, its perfect
swivelling lcd panel. dust delete data facility. good processing software.
after changing up from a 350d to the 60d as you can imagine everything is an improvement
not the latest model but still full of great features and great to own
perfect investment for my first dslr camera, unbeatable price too! feels just right in your hands.
a very good upgrade from the 1100d and the price is right. it doesn't make the slightest difference to the camera that a 'new' model is on the market.
not had it long enough to be too familiar yet but first impressions are good
very good
picture quality is top class for an outstanding price, and a very long battery life.
tilt lcd viewfinder
tres bon produit
the iso range and the quality of the images in poor lighting conditions
great camera. low grain on high iso. i am a photography student, this camera does what i need it to and so much more. high speed shooting mode paired with a high speed sd card is incredible
very good pictures and speed in use; comes with good software/electronic instructions.  easy to use once the basic settings have been set up. uses canon interchangeable lenses from previous body (kept as spare).
a decent camero body for beginner film makers, but, when you unlock the camera to its full potential using magic lantern it can be pushed to a far better than average production tool
good quality of images even at night. easy to use.
superb beginners professional camera, very high quality images
everything
the vari-angle screen is great when using a tripod. the image quality with the 18 mp sensor is brilliant and the fast 5.3fps is ideal for sports photography.
thank you for the very good connection between the quality and the price!
the image quality is so perfect.
feeling
a brilliant camera
screen
feels solid and gives excellent results, like the swivel screen.
technically this camera ticks most of the boxes one would only find on more expensive models.
the one back where you can more it about
lots and lots
all controls to hand flip out l.c.d screen very good easy to control good looking camera thanks
ease of use, weight
great camera highly impressed
excellent automated exposure, focus etc. results are pretty good in almost any lighting condition and it copes extremely well with backlit and over bright subjects. manual settings pretty much in line with canon slrs. i like the presets feature that allows you to get your favourite combination of manual settings for a situation and then switch to them in a single button click when you need to. the manual dial for exposure adjustment is also very useful. the camera gives you the choice of exactly how much help you want it to give you. i've had a fair few compacts and before this the only one i liked was the g5, i like the g12 for all the same reasons
its so versatile for any user even a begginer and the pictures especially in low light are amazing.
excellent quality photos. takes the same battery as my g10 and g11.
too many to list but it has a white balance feature for video. great for underwater.
fantastic range of features in a small, portable body. wide angle lens allows you to capture buildings close up, sweeping landscapes or big crowds, then you can zoom in for portraits etc. camera offers plenty of automated scenes, or you can take over and do everything manually.
solid as a rock. great image quality and nice features. a little buddy to my eos 7d and very handy and transportable. i used it with a wp-dc34 underwater housing  when snorkeling in the greek isles and the results are fantastic! very pleased with my g12 and waterproof case! i've used it at a couple of indoor parties (wedding reception and a birthday bash) with a canon speedlite 270ex  external flash and again the results are superb. dslr standard and no mistake.
very solid construction
the flip out screen is a very useful addition to the g12 making it much easier to take pictures both above and below your normal eye level shot.
i wanted a camera that offered more manual controls and flexibility, having had a canon powershot 560 previously.  i also wanted something that was easily portable and accessible, handbag size in fact.  this is a great camera.  it is easily transported, quick to use and gives great results.  it is very good in low light and the macro setting is also very good.  the battery life is excellent.  the screen is also protected when closed.
noise levels are very good and only start to show as 1600 iso.  not that much different from the g11 though, except for the control dial which is set in the front of the camera in slr fashion.
the image quality and functions are superb. the flexibility of a professional yet the ease of use for a novice. the tilting screen is fab for taking natural shots. the hd movie is great too but it eats into the memory card but great results even on a roller coaster! i love and my kids love the fact you can look through the view finder to take pics which saves on power which enabled me + kids to use it for 4 days of our hols 750 + pics and didn't need to charge it! i also like the neck strap as opposed to the usual wrist strap. the bulkiness is great for big hands like mine and the small hands of my 5 and 7 year olds. i don't envisage we'll by another compact for a good time to come because this meet all our expetations.
great picture quality. compact camera with the features of an slr.
takes excellent images in low light conditions.
optical viewfinder  (i normally wear glasses to read an lcd screen, but don't need to with a viewfinder) / swivelling lcd screen makes it easier to hold camera up high (eg above crowds) when taking pictures / good picture quality.
jpeg facility.
too many to metion
feels quite robust.
excelent various option
handling, reliability, ease of use, range of exposure options, image quality.
exceptional functionality with features of much more expensive slr cameras. i previously owned a canon eos 400d and this has more functions than it did and still provides top quality images. if you don't want to utilise the manual settings the auto settings still produce excellent images, although if it's a snap shot camera you are after look at the lumix tz20
camera before, so i am still learning all the settings on my g12, but i am experimenting with the settings and the pictures i have taken have come out great! if you want to point and shoot then you couldn't fail to get the best results with this camera set in auto mode, the disk that comes with it is also very helpful and well worded for first time snappers. the camera is compact, so literally comes everywhere with me, i have had the g12 for a month now and already have the biggest and best photo albums that i have ever owned. recommend :)
takes photos in raw as well as jpg
this camera is very easy to use.  but features and build quality is great. there are many futures for everybody. overall good camera.
image not bad quality for a compact.         does raw files
pocket size
images are amazing, so far still use auto function :) but it just great
jpeg shooting, grid screen.
great camera
image quality, manual settings
robust construction.  all the features you'd expect from an slr.  compact size and canon's reputation for quality.  takes hundreds of pictures on one charge if you use the viewfinder rather than the rear screen.  exposure compensation and focusing are very good on auto mode.  colour saturation is excellent.
as screen can be covered.
complements my canon 30d slr.
spirit level, high iso image quality, build quality, controls
a sturdy camera that gives the photographer more control than the normal compact.
amazing versatility and excellent picture quality.
we have only just got this camera but so far it is a remarkable camera with many features which will take some time to assimilate but it is all there in the product guide. however without that you can just set it to automatic point and shoot and it will provide you with fantastic images given that you have the ability to frame a shot that is.
i am not a photo-pro but what this camera offers is more than sufficient for me!
build quality,  versatile lcd screen, well featured, ease of use
i love the quality and feel of it, great size too
the video application is very interesting with a good quality
good all round camera
technical spec and build quality
hd video recording excellent low light capabilities
design
raw files, lens quality, build quality, professional standard camera
packs a lot of functions into a small space
results appear to be very good.

very good camera and extremely easy to use. has all the features one could ask for

i like the flip round screen so i can see myself when taking self shots
perfect
position of dials is user friendly.
raw format available.
beautifully made, and as easy or as complicated as you want to make it. fantastic results.
happy with the purchase .
this product takes very good portrait even on the automatic mode. still a beginner so i am learning more everyday, excellent!
good price, features and very good product !
easy to use but very good quality
build, versatility, quality,
easy to use by everyone with profesional abilities.
image quality
love this camera, i bought this so i have a camera with me all the time, it won't fit in your pocket i'd go for the canon s95 if you want a pocket camera. it doesn't replace an slr but over all its a great  camera feels good in your hands  and i've had some great shots from it, i'm glad i went for this over the nikon p7000. go for it i'm sure you'll love it ...
lots of dials - easier to use than software menus
excellent all round camera with easy manual functions and fun creative options
second buy, had a g12 before and loved it.
easy to use and manually operated camera. a really good value for money. picture quality is really nice compared to size.
very easy to use as a point and shoot camera but also with very many sophisticated settings available to put the user in complete control.  almost as good as a dslr but without lens interchangeability, even so the zoom range is very good.
easy to use with excellent quality for a starter camera in photography.
so easy to use good size for your bag - just want i wanted
results appear to be very good.
easy to use
raw files, lens quality, build quality, professional standard camera
packs a lot of functions into a small space
clarity of images
all
very solid build, lovely handling
good clear photo, excellent colours at comfortable distances, (unsure as yet about clarity on longer distance pictures when using zoom)
light, simple and powerful. good quality images
the product is decent with all the modern and uncomplicated functions you would hope for in a compact camera.
wireless transfer is an excellent feature once it's up and running
it is simple to use, takes really sharp photographs and is nice and compact.
good quality, looks nice, picture quality really good, touch screen easy to use.
hi tech camera with lots of goodies . nice and small, handy for your pocket. smart looking camera.
excellent point and shoot. reliably takes a good photo every time even in low light. wifi upload to tablet/phone/pc especially useful. bought this camera as a pocket point and shoot to capture new baby photos. this is easily up to the task.
didn't receive this camera but the canon camera i finaly bought is great
good image quality
feel, and for my use, the picture quality is excellent.
compact, fits shirt pocket. simple layout. good close up picture quality.
great little camera, with some very handy features and image modes. great value for money.
very good camera easey to carry /put it in your pocket and in her handbag
overall a really good camera, you can put in your handbag and take it anywhere. images come out sharp well worth the money.
excellent clarity and sharpness, good auto mode, fast start up, touchscreen is far better than previous reviewers have suggested, needs improvement but still very good!  so light and small is ideal to take everywhere.
wireless feature is excellent.
excellent photos. easy to load onto ipad with canon app.
really easy to use, great quality product.
all in all a much better camera ..my only dissapointment was the change of memory cards as i'd already built up a large stash from my previous eos.
anyone who has never taken a photo before can pick up this camera and  within ten minutes take a great photo. i had a canon eos 400d but the 550d is far far better.
i think its an awesome camera for a good price for 650 its a must buy for beginners. it has very high quality image capture resolution and full hd 1080p aswell as 720p video capture. the kit lense are great if your really new and want to just get into photography. very studly build fits nice in your hands and it isnt too light or too heavy to carry around. the image exporting is very easy just connect and copy images and video files easily. very good camera for all sorts of events and its really good with close-up almost like a macro very good detial. features are also there iso, shutter speed, aperture and many many other cool handy features for you photography shots. defintely a best buy probably my best buy yet and it is worth it. buy it, its awesome!!!
great camera to learn photography on, the images are really sharp and vibrant, all the features of cameras double the price, happy with my purchase
. hd video is incredible.  great feature: focussing whilst in live view; you can zoom in 10x to get pinpoint-accurate manual focus on any part of the image.
already being a canon dslr user, i found the 550d intuitive and simple to understand.  initially i was unhappy that metering mode no longer had a dedicated button, but found that i can access this mode easily though the quick control button instead. the image quality is excellent and with all those pixels, cropping is a doddle.  the hd video quality is very impressive. the 550d does everything i expected it to do and has lived up to my high expectations.  but..... days after purchasing, the 600d was launched.  is the 600d worth the extra cost?
i haven't got to use the hd video feature yet so i can't comment.
it has every feature that you could wish for. it has allot of manual overrides if required.it is light and easy to use. well constructed.
could go on, but it'd be boring - a very good product for it's price range.
delivers everything it promises to!
very easy to use and takes good pictures.  did not have the opportunity to try out the creative zone features yet but having read the manual it should not present any problems.
having upgraded from the canon 400d the difference is superb the new features make the camera easy to use and the live view is great and not to mention the 18 million pixels make your pictures so sharp.
i was able to use the camera and utilise the differing features with ease. the quality of the immages were very good and far superior to the images of my older cannon digital camera. it is light and easy to carry . i am very pleased with my purchase and would certainly recomend it to others.
top end features in a smaller consumer friendly body
the hd video is a good feature. the image quality is good. the eos550d is light to carry.
pro features and pro results on a budget body ! buy some canon l grade lenses for pro results !
easy to use, fantastic image quality, worth at least a look into
this is fourth canon camera i have purchased in the last 20 years, and once again i am impressed with the product. the technology is first class, and the build quality up to canon's usually high standards. this camera is, in my view, aimed at the enthusiast/experienced amateur market, and the operating features certainly allow the enthusiast to experiment easily and safely. that said, the auto features mean that the camera performs well in the more conventional 'point and shoot' mode. overall i believe that this is an excellent camera which i am happy to own and recommend.
the ability to shoot full high definition (1920x1080) video is a big plus, which is the main reason why i bought this particular camera. you can also shoot 50 fps (frames per second pal) or 60fps (ntsc) for slowing the motion down, results are smooth and non jittery. coupled with a decent lens (the lens is everything) still images are fantastic from the 18 mega pixel sensor. the lcd screen is bright and crisp. this being my first dslr i'm well pleased with it. for the price you won't find a better entry level dslr, and i did do a lot of research beforehand.
screen with live viewing so you can preview the shot before you take it and make ajustments to get the result you want. takes small sdhc cards with a high capacity and great processing speed for full 1080p movies which are far cheaper to buy than the cf cards used in most dslrs. the weight is very supprising especally when you compare it to the old models like the 350d is a great camera but the 550d feels lighter and can do a far amount more.
range of features and image is outstanding
a good all round camera a big improvement over the 20d camera execellent  pictures and a hd video camera if needed
the hd video is excellent, superb stills quality.
the zoom lense is terrific.
super easy to use for great quality photos. a great starter dslr.
canon manual is very good, and takes you through the steps easily.
light compact body with a great feature set for the money. the screen is excellent.
it is a good quality dslr. i have been very impressed with the images that i have taken.
canon currently doing a cash back deal on this model
excellent camera. so far i have only used the automatic mode to take photos and the majority of photos are amazingly good quality. this is definately the best camera i've ever owed.
for the price it outweighs its competitors.
excellent specification for the price
sturdy. quality images.
an absolutely incredible camera. like the size, not too heavy for long shoots. bought this purely for video, and it's excellent. as easy or as complicated as your knowledge allows. obviously not as good as 7d, or higher end, hence the 9 rating, and images are only as good as the lenses used and the amount of hours the user puts in. superb.
thus the image quality is outstanding in this price class and resolution range.
having bought this camera as a complete amateur, and i've been nothing but impressed so far: easy to use, and a good manual - you can basically start straight away on the automatic settings, and get fantastic results, but then there is plenty of room to grow and get more experimental. gets a thumbs up from me!
great camera, great pics , packed with features. very pleased
prior mirror up
very easy to use easy to handle thechnical spec easy to understand a very good allround camera for the amature photographer
so easy to use great image quality many features to enhance your photography experience can't wait to take it on holiday,
ergonomics is also great, previously had a 450d and the 550d feels much better in your hands.
image quality, features, large screen to review images, or use for live view. controls are generally well positioned and easy to use. i stepped up from my old 350d, which was very good, but this is excellent, a real pleasure to use.
my first dslr and very impressed. great spec for the price. has all the features i need and more.
my canon 550d easy to use very good camera,a good upgrade from my 450d
easy to use fantastic results
most programmes work well with ease and picture quality is far better than the old version 300d that it replaces
just brilliant
fantastic picture quality. everything you could need on a camera and more. video quality is excellent
number of features for a reasonable price
a lot smaller and lighter than the 10d , 30d etc , menu is slightly different but you can notice a massive improvement in shutter speed and the quality of your pictures
happy with the camera rplaced my previous canon with this one.
ease of use in auto mode
great camera, easy to focus in on one part of photo in photoshop,
excellent image quality. able to use old analogue eos camera lenses on new digital eos.
easy to understand instruction book with the product.
not tried canon software yet.
first dslr. on full auto very easy to use with excellent results.  now trying all the features and taking a bit of learning (well past retirement age), but with practice i am sure it will prove to be an excellent purchase.
simple to use, gives excellent high quality photographs having 18mp, photographing in raw gives outstanding results, however it also has an easy mode for beginners, a light camera, but strong build, each setting gives a brief explination on the large display screen.
easy to use, brilliantly sharp photos camera is a great price.
only had for 2 weeks so still trying out , excellent images
excelent picture quality with fast refresh rate. very easy to use. highly recommended.
this is a lovely camera, ready to go in manual to take lovely clear pics and easy to use to learn how to take pics by setting yourself. lens with camera a good start for most pics, battery life good.
great value.
all good apart from raw file will not open in photoshop cs3
af very quick, is excellent, reduces blur
the canon 550d is an easy to use dslr camera also being female find its ideal for smaller hands, but not to small, its full of features you would expect from a dslr and the image quality is fantastic very impressed with the camera
so far very good.
great to use. ease to learn and fanastic results...
brill
all good but i have moved up from a much older lower spec nikon.
software linked directly to a laptop to view and store images, most bimportant when working with a microscope.
i found it straight forward and easy to use with noticeable improvement on portrait picture quality, which was what i was looking for.
camera is fairly lightweight for dslr with a good feel to it.  the screen is easy to view and the battery life is exceptionally good.  essentially i bought it for taking pictures of my lads playing football and cricket which it does very well with the tamron telephoto lens i added.  the advantages over 35mm are massive as you can take so many more photos thus achieving some really great pictures whilst deleting the rubbish ones.  this is great for the teenagers to learn to take great pics.
good camera in that price range
easy to change settings and features
overall, after 2 weeks of intermittent use i thoroughly recommend this camera.
easy to use. terrific zoom lense.
and no need to carry giant telephoto or extra-wide-angle lens, so the nikon will generally stay at home.
if you're an amateur who wants to take professional looking pics that will impress your friends and don't want to spend a fortune, i would highly recommend this camera.
canon quality of lens and image.
easy to use camera with plenty of functions and a zoom which is more than you will ever need, nice to have the option of a viewfinder on bright sunny days. quality of images is excellent.
easy to work out manual modes, even if starting from scratch. sharp focus, even at max zoom. several modes for different effects. viewfinder enables use on sunny days. led screen tilts so you can take shots of mushrooms etc without diving in the dirt. very good battery life
better value than old sx10is; high performance so no need to buy dsrl at far greater price.
having had a canon a630 for some years i have found using the sx40 hs fairly easy. like the flip out back screen, viewfinder is fairly good (shows information rather than just image). find that the camera tends to let in quite a lot of light in auto mode so i find setting the iso at 100 in p mode gives reasonable results. you do have to play around with the settings to get the best results. i like the features such as colour swap, which works well. zoom lens is good for the camera price. the camera is more compact than an slr allthough you still need a bag rather than a case.
same features as other canon cameras meaning it's easy to find your way around.
many features
image quality - best of the segment, at this time; video quality, also excellent.
just returned from a few days away,i found the optical zoom brilliant.even without a tripod the pictures were rock steady on full zoom.
fantastic camera, great pictures and features. everything is much better than i expected. if looking for a bridge camera this is the smart choice.
reasonably easy to use, great optical zoom, small and light.  great for someone who wants slightly more than a point and click but doesn't want the complexity of a full blown slr.  all in all, this is very good general camera which anyone could use and get good solid results and represents extremely good value for money.
fantastic zoom, sharp images
the zoom is amazing
solidly built.
it's not complicated to use, good quality picture from maximum zoom, no hassle as no lenses to change.
ease of use and number of features, filters etc. and not least a fantastic zoom
the ultra big zoom can go to 140x (35x  x 4x) with the added digital zoom with great results.  anti shake at high zoom works well. video quality is good.image quality very good. value for money is great.
it's relatively compact and light to carry, photos are clear and sharp and the screen makes viewing so simple.
no more carrying around big len,es in bag on holiday.
very simple to use and understand. fantastic zoom facility and wide angle.  makes high quality photography very simple.
good quality photos and easy to use for first time bridge camera user. love adjustable viewer.
easy to handle superb photos all in all a good camera
very good zoom, which is what i wanted it for. easy to use and good quality images.
zoom, hd video, stability control

every thing i have tried so far

easy to use, great features, fantastic zoom, pictures are good.
versatile flip screen.
a very good all-rounder: a really easy camera to have with you and never miss a moment. video performance also very good.
so many other features
a fantastic camera for someone who wants great results but dosn't have to be an expert to achieve them. my first impression is that i wont have to ever upgrade this camera, is does it all for me in one neat package.
so easy to use and literally point and click for great photos - even from a moving car!
distance.
great quality and design
many possibility with this bridge, excellent fo user who want to be a photographer!
i need a lot more practice before i can truthfully come up with any good points.
all of them
early days but impressed overall
tr\xe8s bon capteur, tr\xe8s bon zoom
its best camera for basic users even for professionals as well ! it has all those features which you can imagine to use and enjoy in your friends and alone ! if using with a tripod stand its even better !
long zoom
easy to use for a beginner.
flip screen handy for anglers like me for taking self takes.
easy and intuitive to use
easy to use
great results compared to standard slr's that i've previously owned and used.
my best camera so far and i've had quite a few, my very first camera was a canon. i love the zoom which is the reason i bought it as i'm going on safari next month.
only a small loss in quality at higher iso 1600
all are made easy.
clear pictures
awesome zoom, brilliant camera all round
great prices as at july 2012
great features
turns a beginnger into an amateur overnight!
great value
good quality pictures. big zoom. frame assist button (helping to locate the object when zoomed in)
easy to use. i love it, wish i hadn't wasted those 2 weeks  looking and just got on and got it when i 1st saw it,i would definitely recommend it  and  well worth the price.
this camera is a big step up for me. when i used it for the first time and saw the results it inspired me to learn more as it isn't your usual point and shoot. i'm happy to say the pictures i get now are not even the slightest comparable to my old a550. there much much better! it does take a little longer to set up but the results are amazing. this is by a long way the best purchase i have made in a long time and i am treating it as an investment as i will be using this for a long time.
i upgraded from an eos 10d that cost a lot more body only 8 years ago and the 7d is light years ahead with the 18-135 lens. what a bargain!
a great camera from canon. i stepped up from the 450d wanting something more from the enthusiast range and cannot fault this. i'm still getting to grips with some of the functions but overall it's easy to use.
function / setting becomes available.  all in all the months of should i --shouldnt i were wasted ----i definitly should have purchased earlier
the camera design is professional with comprehensive options that allow the photographer the opportunity to manage their shots.  take a day to read the handbook thoroughly before using!  once you have experienced the operation of the camera and decided on your needs then it is time to purchase the right filters.
i never forgot that and you would do well to remember it to. the canon 7d? to me, it is simply the best.
construction feels superb
great quality motion picture images, excellent control of image quality and color balance, fast down load time.
the camera is so well built and such a pleasure to use that it is difficult to enumerate its good points.  image quality is outstanding, and image stabilization is a real boon in situations where it is difficult to hold the camera rock steady.  the camera is remarkably well designed so that it can be held firmly and comfortably with all the controls readily accessible without their getting in the way or running the risk of being accidentally touched.  the accompanying manual is well presented and thorough.
superb quality photos, excellent build quality. so many features for any situation. highly recommended.
produces great images with normal excellent canon build quality, easily configurable and highly featured; though i found this camera quite a step up from the eos40d and it takes some concerted to get the best out of it
the automatic functions are very positive and quick, especially the autofocus. dial changing to other modes, and changes in mode functions by the shutter button are easy to change.
auto focus, av mode...19 focul points.
quality camera with great hd video!
great quality and pictures. amazing shutter speed. good video. simple to use and change parameters
, and was particularly pleased with being able to review the pictures taken on the large viewing screen.
the camera is fantastic and the price is very affordable.
but even better when you get to know it better!!
from first picking up to the ease of spinning the various control dials, this camera oozes quality. i love it.
i like the feel and ease of use of the camera, the 18-135mm lens is ideal for day to day use as it offers a great range and versatility.
really pleased
takes excellent pictures and is very easy to use especially in full auto, fairly idiot proof in that respect.
automatic settings. very easy to learn how to use. being able to take stills at same time as movies. still images fantastic.
speed. great low light image quality.
only had the camera a short period but very impressed.
everything especially the continual shooting and film making
easy to operate and quality of pictures superb. range of features good and menu system easy to navigate and find options.
good build plenty ajustments,picture great quality.
clear focus screen and grids
having only just nice got the camera unpacked and the weather being some what typically british (rain, rain, rain) i havent had much time with using the camera, however first impressions are great! quality product, nice feel to use and the 18-135 lens is seems like it has the best of all worlds! very happy - now were's that sun shine...
great camera which produces very good quality images, superb!
fantastic build. buttons in all the right places! video capability is excellent. really good in low light. hard to imagine a much better cropped sensor camera.
great image quality, good build quality, lots of features
feels good in the hand
very nice to handle, well integrated and, after some study of the manual, easy to use and change settings quickly. comes with a useful set of software.
a really great camera for all aspects of photography.
wow pictures
great build
the list is endless
as at now i am satisfied, thanks
absolutely stunning pictures! video is good as well even in low light!
wonderful product. unbelievable what you can do with it.
great camera, can't fault.  hd video is fantastic!
everything
great canon quality. extended iso range excellent for low light settings.
amazing image
prise en main,rapidit\xe9,qualit\xe9
tres bonne gestion de la lumiere par rapport au 450 d
easy to use
creative auto
excellent value camera. especially now that the mk ii has been released.
photo mode is excellent, everything you'd expect from a top-end canon. lens is okay, definitely worth the extra money over the body-only option. video mode is excellent, shooting in 60fps is awesome for slow-motion and to give edits a deeper feel.
easy to use.
8fps
the new focusing system with selective areas coupled with a great viewfinder is fantastic. 8 frames a second capture. flash commander built in. 25fps hd video is utterly sublime. built like a tank and handles superbly. lcd is majorly improved. huge shot count from one battery charge. high resolution. sensor cleaning.
outstanding image quality. but it does deserve the best possible lenses you can afford.
i have given the camera 9s across the board because there is always room for improvement, but within its class i don't think there is a better camera on sale at the moment. if i didn't have a 1d3 and 5d2 it might well have received a solid row of 10s.
very easy to use. the overall image quality is a huge step up from my 400d. the possibilities are endless with this camera and i can see the progression already. a very happy boy...
is a boon for macro work. the different af possibilities are great - though they take some mastering. to be truthful it is apparent that canon have consulted with many experienced photographers in producing this camera, as this camera is the sensible development from earlier models, it omits virtually all of the little niggles!
fantastic semi-pro camera that rivals and betters the 5d mkii.  i chose the 7d due to the faster shutter speed and better low light capability + compatability with existing ep-s lenses.
this is a great camera for an enthusiast  or semi pro with previous slr/eos  experience. the menu layout is first class with a number of custom functions which should be utilised to get the best from the camera. the build quality is excellent and feels solid and reliable. the quality of the images are 1st class, with great control of noise at high iso's. the camera is intuitive in use and does not take long to get used to.. read the manual, get to know the camera and all the facilities on offer and you have got an excellent tool for making great images. i use the camera for wild life photography and 8 frames per second  suit this very well.   highly recommended
super fast response with a very quick 8.0 frames per second burst rate making this ideal for sports or wildlife photography. very high build quality with the magnesium alloy body. so many customisable options i've lost count. the autofocus is also excellent with numerous af point selections, af expansion points, zones e.t.c and to top it off it is weather and dust sealed too. the best aps-c digital slr you can currently buy, period.
quality camera build with lots of functionality.  images are excellent.  there is a lot to learn with this camera but very pleased with it and it is worth the money no doubt about that.
the continous shoot at 8 frames per second is awesome
not had it long but the images i have taken have been fantastic quality, the new focusing system and extra af options are remarkable!
a super camera. i upgraded from a 50d. very nice in every aspect worth the extra money over the 50d.
superb camera for the experienced photographer - not for beginners. brilliant metering system providing optimum exposure under a wide variety of conditions. very accurate automatic white balance. long battery life. auto iso setting between 100 - 3200 iso.
5. excellent and very clear menu system.
this is a good solid built camera and is very easy to use and the price is very good .
i upgraded from 400d so i had much to learn because so many good things to use. this gives you so much more especially if you are doing wildlife hand held. results on fast shoot on top qual  are excellent for e.g. fast moving orcas and sea otters from a moving ship in a swell at long length. also uses cf so didn't need to change format though obviously it uses latest and fastest cards. i'm glad i did it!
solid and better built than previous generations of similar canon hybrid cameras. large file size an advantage to a pro. spot on focusing. fast burst rate without motor drive. hd video!
as a keen wildlife photogragher, (especialy birds),i find the spot focusing on the eos 7d very usefull, it helps me pick out my target and get a good clear shot.
early days but the image quality is excellent and particularly when pushed at the hight iso end, still a lot to learn
excellent build quality
excellent camera.
this camera is without a doubt, a dream to use and will lift your photography skills to another level. in your hands, it feels a substantial piece of equipment that delivers on all the media hype and then some more! the power is easily controlled thanks to excellent menu access and i just love the ability to be able to refine my personal shooting settings for macro or birds in flight (as examples) and switch from one to another in less than a second. the benchmark for all sub pro dslr camera's.
built like a tank and fully loaded with pro features.  so happy with this choice.  it's hard to understand the cost difference between cameras when comparing on the web but having these things in front of you makes it much easier.  the build quality, weight, layout and features are fantastic.
build quality and ergonomics are fantastic.  hd video is a plus but it shouldn't be the deciding factor if you're considering this camera.
cannot pass an opinion on the hd video as this no interest to me.this camera is just great, combined with the canon l lenses it will take some beating.
well designed, ergonomically good, the controls are to hand and the instruction manual is simple and comprehensive.
the video quality is awesome.  we shot a music video that is now in rotation.
if full frame censor is of no concern, then i would not hesitate in recomending this awesome canon camera!
solid feel
robust, good at higher iso, easy to use
7 d to suit personal needs. so far, it has done everthing asked of it.
wonderfull camera equiped with many functions, perfect quality of pictures, very fast, precise af
simply a great canon dlsr
live mode helpful.
the canon 7d was an upgrad for my 400d, metering system is very good pictures are pin sharp and colour saturation is excellent. also found the live view very usefull espiecally with close up shots. the constuction is solid and copes well in wet weather. another good feature is the hd video.
solid build quality - takes stunning pictures with good glass. well appointed.
the good points are build quality and technical specification - this is a really advanced piece of camera technology at the price.
fantastic build quality, speed and accuracy of the focusing, features - its going to be a steep learning curve!, the rear screen is excellent, easy menu navigation, i could go on, but i think you may get the drift by now, if you can afford it, the get one!
takes super good speed shots for sports photography
range of iso rating, choice of advanced operations/shooting modes. being able to customise function settings.  on initial use images appear sharp and natural.  choice of autofocus points.  autofocus is quick but have yet to try it out properly in low light situations.  although not into movies i can see this as a useful added feature and will probably use.
everything
built like my old t90, hope the 7d still works after 26 years, great features can't think of any situation it would not handle
10
fantastic camera body with great features and movie making ability.
great camera, takes amazing shots.  a lot more features than my previous canon so make sure you read up on how to make the best use of the features.  good option if you're an experienced amateur looking to turn pro.
its just a joy to use
image quality, features, and if you are used to canon eos bodys its easy to use
solidly built, lots of features, stunning picture quality...a really excellent dslr camera!!!
the camera was an upgrade from my trusty 400d. it is a lot more advanced and has loads more features on it, it wasnt as straightforward to use as the 400d but there are some great tutorials on the canon website. the focus system can be quite complicated but the video's explain everything really well. tip: you have to enable the spot focusing in menu 3 on the camera, otherwise you're stuck with the autofocus system that is a bit hit and miss.
the camera is very easy to use, the image quality is excellent and overall the camera is great value for money.
i had the 400d before this which i thought was very good, but this 7d is everything..it feels and acts like a pro camera and the video is immese.
i'm still on a learning curve with the cameras capabilities but it's an enjoyable process and the results are really quite amazing.
screen is great and overall quality is fantastic, big step up from my 20d the 7d replaces well worth the upgrade.
auto focus extremely fast and accurate.
lots of functions.  you definitely need to read themanual while going through the menus.  picture quality superb.  it is amazing in low light and not too grainy with the noise reduction on.  great camera - just a pity the replacement canon batteries are so expensive!
great camera.  have used a 7d for 4 years and have some great shots. tried and trusted. if you're still thinking about it - don't. go ahead and buy
all within a high level build quality.
great solid camera,great images.
nice lightweight body, beautifully finished and compares very well to d1 and d1s series.the 7d is the perfect camera for travel, the battery charger is small and light as well.the images compare very well to the d1 mk4 and d1s mk2 up to a3 size, more than enough for most photographers.the inbuilt level is perfect for use with tilt/shift lenses.
overall-awesome!
ease of use
the 7d has been assessed by dpreview as the best crop-frame digital slr available. excellent build quality; 9fps burst rate; magnesium body; good range of menu features; 19-point focussing with selectable zones; 18mp sensor; effective dust removal on start-up and shut-down.
all ...
canon have delivered another winner!
extraordinary quality. able to record video
really well built camera with good weight balance
behaves extremely well and shoots perfectly. everything you would expect from a brilliant canon dslr.
an upgrade from a canon 400d so far it has lived up to its reputation, although still getting to know all the features i am enjoying it, feels really solid, i have found it easy to adapt from the 400d..
the d 7 feels so good to handle,it is the best that i have used.whilst there are a lot of features to get used to,they are all layed out in a very user friendly way. i have needed to take time to familiarise my self with the controls,but it is after all a step up in class for me. overall a great. camera
sturdily built with so many specifications you are spoilt for choice.excellent image quality.i find the ability to trigger slave flashguns a great asset.
image quality, customisation
8 frames/sec shooting, great for sports. bright view finder. easy quick select screen.
all in, very good dslr.
light weight and easy to use
easy to handle  not complicated excellant rear screen
the camera is great, still trying to figure out all the functions!
good build, great functions.
i am a sports photographer, so speed of shooting is impressive 8 fps and  focusing is excellent..
i have recently upgraded to the 7d. what a fantastic bit of kit. i am really happy. simples to use, outstanding build quality and, i hope, it will prove to be good value.
solid build, feels good in the hand and excellent pictures
it has everything a semi-pro or enthusiastic amateur could ever want. the build quality is especially good - it feels solid and the ergonomics is much better than other eos models i've used - it just fits!
easy to use.  every thing you could want in dslr
great machine!
i find it comfortable to use and it is similar to the nikon i already have. i will still have to get use to the slight differences but i find it very user friendly.
didnt need to look at handbook as i have a number of canon dslr's.  first canon i have purchased that doesnt hav a focus issue on moving objects. i did move to nikon d300 but i find the 7d more to my liking
this product has everything you want for a digital slr. it's simply amazing!!!
fast, fully featured, ease of use.
menu layout good without too many levels to plough down through. the 1.6 x crop factor because of the c size sensor makes it ideal for wildlife because the lenses can be smaller and lighter.  not too heavy to carry.
i was blown away by the weight and build quality.  this camera far outperforms my abilities, and probably goes some way beyond my amateur aspirations, but i love it.  i paired it with the 24-105mm l-series lens and the colours are breathtaking.  the menus are complex but logical and the flexibility is astounding.  i plan to keep this camera for many years.
all the menus are fairly easy to access. the image qaulity is very impressive and the 8 frames per second is awesome.  i do lots of landscape photos and the ttl level is really useful.  the other level on the screen is also useful when set it up on a tripod. i like the quick access menu button.
easy to use, if you have used older canon slr's this will be a doddle! excellent quality build and images.
fairly light compared to the full-frame cameras.
bought for my son who is a seasoned photographer and very pleased with it
easy to use and very good value
solid build.  fab picture quality and i love the live view on it.  had a canon 400d before so could find my way around the camera fairly easily.  good job as camera came with no instructions so got them from canon website.
fast, accurate focusing (with canon 70-300mm is usm lens). i use this combination for birds-in-flight photography and the results are very good.
professional camera built well!
blows my 550d out of the water ive have just come out of the dark ages after 2 years of putting up with my first dslr thats the learning curve
nice pictures .
while recording the huge amount of data to the card), 8fps very welcome when taking hdr, the ability to control my 3 external flashes from the built in. viewfinder is much better! 100% coverage, plus more info.
speed,flexibility, user friendliness, it's simply a perfect shooter!!
it's all good
excellent product
the camera is amazing, upgraded from canon eos 450d to the 7d, due to lens mount, no regrets, excellent value for money, almost half the price of uk model, camera language had to be changed from japanise but luckily was able to find you tube video with easy to follow instruction.  otherwise - very happy
very fast, nice innovations such as automatic leveling.
camera terminology, control screens very good, digital layout not to complicated compared to other cameras of this type. buttons laid out very conveniently, good grip on this camera as camera is wieghty but well made. video good with easy crossover switch from stills. fast 8 frames per second in burst. this is a much better camera than the 550d but both are excellent cameras. has better weatherproofing although not total as much more expensive cameras. camera feels a solid well made camera in light magnesium metal instead of plastic.
this dslr trumps the 5d mark ii on every level except for the full frame sensor that the mark ii has! one of canon's best dslr's around!
good have been ligter. for some reason camera canon makes all all pro-semipro camera models very heavy!
live view easy touse
best in canon range for all round aspects of photography
every thing is good
18 megs , 8fps, lcd....
feels like a real camera!!
fantastic camera. picture quality better than expected. my previous camera was the canon 450d. thought that was a good camera but compared with the 7d there's no comparison. thought i knew a bit about photography but with the 7d i have a lot to learn. looking forward to it.
build and af
so use friendly, and upgrading from 500d so easy to just pick up and use.  focus points great giving plenty of scope. image quality supberb.
great autofocus system. excellent build quality. very customizable operation.
excellent build quality, feels good in the hands, the buttons are all in the right place, sturdy solid.
this is an great camera. it provides a good choice for anybody who has out grown the canon domestic d-slr range but is not a professional.
video good
canon quality, well built.
high quality performance
it odes ewverything you want
a fantastic evolution in the canon range with amazing features. i have only just received this but i am so looking to put it to the test!
lots of good features but let down but image quality
compared to my first camera, which is eos 50d, 7d is a better to use, e.g  on/off switch. image quality is very good.
controls have a better layout
stunning camera as expected from canon.  it takes an incredably brilliant photograph.
quick focusing
i purchased this camera for the 8 frams per second facility it has enabled me to take much better sports shots
heard good about the camera
feels good, loofs good, handles well.

just fantastic
this camera is very good value for money in comparison to the new mark ll version
it is so user friendly and is a solid well built camera.the image quality is brilliant and is favoured by a lot of professional photographers.
solid build, fantastic images and definitely a big step up from the 550d
great camera for all photographic needs

its a canon
great image quality, great auto focus system, ergonomics very similar to my main camera (5d mark iii) which makes this a great second body.
very complete
more modes/settings than you will ever need.
very happy to have upgrade and far better quality after long time old canon 450d.  feel so confident during clicks.
brilliant camera. superb quality!

too many to write about
i cannot fault this camera it 10 out of 10
??? the only available score is the picture quality.
flexibility of af system
very good quality-price rapport
nice grip with a proper l series lens
great quality at high iso and low light, highly functional and allows you to upgrade to professional quality without having to get rid of lenses from previous canon consumer level cameras. the three custom settings are great for hdr photography and the ability to create your own menu shouldn't be overlooked. the quick screen facility is also welcome.
it brilliant
the feel , the weight, the focusing point system, the menu layout. easy to navigate once you get the hang of it.
easy to use good quality pictures
ease of use

layout, functions and design are similar to all other canon dslr's which makes it easy to get started with.
build quality, image quality, auto focussing, exposure control, 8 fps
good sensor, makes good hd, makes good raw images
solid build, quality feel, image qualitry and shooting speed

very good camera!
quality build, natural and progressive user interface (having upgraded and been familiar the canon 40d body)
i have a canon 40d and a 50d , but this camera , is much better , and of course the experience that make this camera a very good purchase.
its made by canon
good build quality, lots of pro features, lightweight !
love it !!!!
excellent quality
does what it's supposed to do - an excellent camera body, when used with my canon 400 f5.6 l usm lens and my sigma 500 f4.5 hsm lens.
pop up flash so useful and wonder why this is not on the 1d mk 4 etc.
image quality and all the features make it good bit of kit
great camera and when combined with a good lens on the front produces some stunning results - can't fault it at all as yet!
much better value than anyone else i could find.
huge range of features.  good fot canon users who already have a portfolio of canon lenses. excellent build quality and images.
amazing picture quality, amazing extras etc .. easy to use once setup ... video is amazing on it if lit correctly ..
only one word to use - superb!
still trying it out
so far, its just an excellent camera
fabulous canon product. finally something ridiculously economical. razor sharp, extremely fast. magnesium water sealed body. the only competitor within canon forces is 5d mark 3 (not mentioning 1 series).
8.5 fps,i've. iiew overall quality
too many to mention, very good camera.
the 7d is a complicated hi end camera with many functions. it takes some time to navigate your way around it and its menu, but once you have got there the images look great and with the right lenses your set to do some amazing work.
excellent raw image even at high iso.jpegs slightly soft though
good points are its 19 auto focus points for fantastic pin sharp pictures and more for advance photographers
build quality and image quality
without reading the instruction book, i started from where i left of with an older eos slr.  now just want to buy new lenses
just a brilliant camera, full of different aids to help produce stunning shots.
handles well and is well balanced especially with a battery pack on the bottom
will worth the saving.
unbelievable how fast the camera is ideal for shooting wildlife on the move. good points, i can't think of any bad points so glad i bought it
beautiful camera great price.
hopefully no need to upgrade
as irs new i'm still getting to grips with the set up and settings
a brilliant camera that does everything i expect of it.
an exceptionally versatile camera for the keen amateur.
all points
easy to use and lots of features but you need new l lenses for extremely good pictures otherwise in every way it is a very first pro quality camera with 1.6x cropping.
an insanely top quality camera - it may not be full frame like its big brother canon 5d, but it sure does impress with its performance and quality.
very fast and accurate focus. good choice of focus points. can use ef and efs lenses.
good camera
versatility, able to use it for different types of photography.  viewfinder - especially the wide array of focussing points.  much improved live view compared to my 50d.
if you are buying this camera then one would presume that you have a good grasp of the usual manual settings on your existing canon. the 7d takes you to the next level with high quality fast shooting there at your fingerprints. i love it and only wished i'd had it in new zealand a month ago what improvement i might have seen in the images i had taken on my old canon.
all the good points i've experienced with previous canons
well built, good layout high on features,and video is first class
fgood for film and moving image
i am very pleased with this camera!
fast focusing
huge viewing screen, great live view and the in-built flash triggers other canon flashes. waterproofed body seals are good and the 'quick view' button is a good addition. hd video looks interesting but camera not bought for that facility. the pentaprism is great as i wear spectacles and appreciate the clear view.
excellent servo modes for tracking moving subject
very good quality, impressive user features
had all the features i was looking for and some!
excellent quality well laid out buttons. very quick and responsive.
solid construction, fast shutter burst, good lcd display, excellent focussing live view, movie mode (though not really had time to use much yet)
features and build quality
8 frm per second , quick change menue button and picture quality
shots per second
excellent quality, good features
excellent image quality
fantastic images in low light, fast image burst mode and amazing quality 25p full hd video with great dof depending on which lenses and settings you use.
large pixel count with high resolution.  appears to improve speed of focusing.  excellent virually noise free images, even at high iso speeds.  superb ergonomics.  quick menu is a breeze.  big clear rear screen which is excellent in thethered mode.
50d cameras, very good frame rate,
superb new af system! packed with features such as wireless flash control, weather sealing, video, af microadjust, spirit level and above all fast 8fps!
8fps great for shooting sport. high iso with great results
overall, very pleased with the camera - had some reservations over the price when i purchased it but no longer as you get what you pay for with this camera, ie. really good quality and a 'feel good factor' whenever you use it.
excellent, even in low light. videos are very steady.
it's a good size, i like the colour (it's different to basic silver and the surface means it doesn't get finger marks on). the screen is a decent size so you can see the pictures you've taken. it has a really good array of settings which definitely help you take better pictures.
stunning images from the smallest camera i have ever owned. the literal definition of point and shoot with enough ability to tweak photos to keep the avid photographer happy.  even the high definition video is super. because it is so small i always carry it when i am out and about and as such have taken some really excellent candid images. with image quality like this the thought of carrying a huge dslr is almost laughable.
bought this after reading reviews.  wanted a point and shoot compact camera to take family shots, with decent image quality.  very easy to use - i haven't actually read the manual yet, just charged it up and started clicking, using the auto setting, which works really well.  pictures are great and it's so easy to use.  i also really like the weight and feel of the camera - it feels sturdy.
super image quality, almost no shutter lag, beautiful solid construction, very compact.
beautiful looking camera that is easy to use.
great little camera. no bigger than a credit card in length and width. easy to keep in your trouser pocket on a night out. used it properly for the first time on a trip to poland, did everything i needed it too.
love the look of the camera, the compact size fits easily in a pocket and feels really solid. screen good, pictures great even in low light, fast start up time, minimum delay in shots and really simply to use, but with all the features if you want to go through the menus (which are a little confusing to begin with). i did quite a lot of research into which camera to buy, for being robust, compact, good quality and value - i picked the right one.
response to capture movement.  zoom quality is also what we wanted.  picture clarity is great.
built to the standards of an expensive wrist watch - ie incredibly small, but quite heavy, ie substantial, so quite easy to hand hold relatively steadily.  zoom range also quite incredible, fast and, for its size, quite easy to set even though its response to zoom commands is near instantaneous. as a minute, every day working camera it is a tour de force, but of course - because it is so small, it cannot hope to equala larger quality, or slr camera (especially one using film) for the outstanding definition needed for large to very large enlargements and prints. though pricey, its cost is justified by its performance
a good sturdy little camera, easy to use. ideal for the quick snapshots, can also be used for the more composed shots. i use this little camera in conjunction with my dslr.
i had a powershot sx210is but i found it too fidgety as i was used to having an ixus beforehand.  this ixus is amazingly easy to use and is packed with features from low lighting to fish eye effects, from miniatures to smart shutter etc.  at first the metal casing feels a little rough compared to other canons i've owned but you will get use to the casing soon enough.  great build, very sturdy and the hd 1080p video recordings are the best!!
build quality and reliability - second time i have bought an ixus
very small and with many great features, many options allowing you to tailor the camera to your needs. feels well built and of high quality, great value for money. i have tried quite a few cameras before this and most were not as good and much larger cameras were no better, the equivalent lumix was very poor unless in perfect light. my old powershot s60 produced slightly better images more easily, but being an old camera it has begun to die and was bulky and heavy compared to the ixus which i can take everywhere and almost match the s60 quality and take full hd video too.
very few buttons, so easy to use, superb picture and screen quality, good in low light level, multi shot mode excellent, wide angle lense for size of camera is excellent
the camera is small and compact with loads of great features and it takes good quality pictures.
very good price to get this standard camera.
beautiful design and the photos are excellent for a point and shoot. the camera is very compact and i love the vibrancy on the red finish.
this is a really compact pocket camera with a great range from wide angle to telephoto its has a solid build, its easy to use with many smart features and appears very versatile. a great little camera. its a great advance on previous compacts i've had.
size, ease of use to take photo, review, delete,
had previous ixus cameras, this one seems as good as the others
good video facility
you can never go wrong with a canon camera.
good build easy to use
fabulous clarity, sharp pictures, bright screen, typical canon build quality
very intuitive to use and the auto setting is perfect for effortless quick shots. the ability to take close up shots with this camera is amazing!
would recommend as an excellent value for money camera with many good features and ease of use.
the camera is easy to use, picture quality is excellent and overall it is a very good compact camera. i would certainly recomment it.
brilliant in low light, small and easy to fit into your pocket, a fantastic product for little money, perfect for anyone wanting a smart, everyday camera.
easy to use in image and movie mode, consistently good pictures with auto mode, value for money
cracking little camera.  very small - fits easily in a pocket.  looks good too.
easy to carry....feels good to hold...discret,and not complicated,nothing really fiddly about it.basic good quality.hope to have it for many years.
this camera is great as it is small, fits in your pocket and is so quick and easy to use.  all of the extra features are great too.  if you want something that takes a great photo but fits in your handbag on a night out this is the camera for you.  i am made up with it.
slim design, lightweight, good for pocket use. excellent picture quality.
lots of features that are really easy to use
overall a beautiful camera to hold and use, and i am pleased to own it, however on reflection i would look for a higher quality image with more basic image functions - and look to add image features using pc software.
very small, genuine pocket camera. image quality ok for the price and way ahead of any camera phone.
the zoom reaches 20x even though spec says 5 (5.1-20 is extended and looses some quality but also works in video)
superb detail reasonable value considering the size.easy to use.we will see how it works on holiday.
easy to use, easy to navigate, metal casing nice and smooth feel. bright lcd showing what image has been taken.
easy to use and compact
very slim.  nice large screen on the rear. very easy to use.
excellent love it.
black colour has a good matt surface, very good build quality, minimal buttons, so very easy to use. great hd videos, good slow motion videos, great high speed burst. good screen. tiny, and easy to carry to around. overall and excellent buy.
great quality pics and video. loads of effects. colour swap etc, easy 2 use, so chuffed
good image quality at 3000x4000px.
really sharp photos and easy to carry around. crisp colours - can't fault it at all.very compact thus easy to carry in the pocket - handy to keep as a second camera besides a dslr.
compact, high quality build, fantastic picture quality
great camera, i mainly use it for video use but take the odd photos, it captures everything brilliantly.
very easy to use on point and shoot. excellent picture quality. amazingly compact. useful to be able to make digital pictures of about 2mb on a4 setting ie not too big. very classy finish. superb value for money. the perfect convenient point and shoot compact camera.
great video too.
really good camera, it is very small but the quality is brilliant.  would recommend others to buy the camera.

bought from clearance section, was a exhibition display model but looked unused so perfect. stylish, quality. would not buy a less model than this for quality of build and features.
really easy to use!  i've never had a digital camera before, and am generally not very good at gadgets.  but i had this up and running in no time. also, very light and compact, so will be great for taking on my travels.

idiot proof!!!!
10/10 very pleased with my purchase. very compact, full of features and easy to use.
very good quality pictures and load of featutes.. value for money in tha sense..
i am insanely pleased with my purchase.
very good camera for starting a slr experience and a great upgrade for those who had early models like 1000d or 450d, and still wont to keep a small body camera.superb videos and photos. i am very happy with it.
good price as 650d just out, but v little difference between them.
a light package, makes a great 2nd body to back up my 7d. i've used it for travel with a single lens (sigma 18-250mm f/3.5) and it is working well. i am extremely pleased with the images.
handles well, image quality is stunning. lens changing is easy and quick. i'm a canon fan having had various models over the years, this is up there with the best.
excellent images,  rotating flip out lcd invaluable, good instructions. new to dslr photography but this seems like the best product on the market to take me on a journey from beginner to amateur. even on to college / uni level photography.
extremely impressed and well the worth the money.
the vari angle lcd is great  esp when using the hd recording. liveview brings the user frienliness of compacts to this model too.
this is my first dslr.i like it because of the ease of use.if we work with scene intelligent mode of the camera its as simple to shoot without any manual hazzle.this is a fully automatic version.the picture quality never make you feel dissappointed.
i am just learning to use a dslr camera very sharp pictures overall quite good at moment
so far i am very happy with my new camera, so i can only tell that everything is good :)
the led  display unit gives all the information that you need and i lke the fact that you can take photos over the top of objects people etc by looking at the led dispay
very good camera...i really recommend for any beginner...more than i expected.
what can i say, but it's ease into dslr photograghy has made it very much fun and you just want to learn as you go
very quick to focus and taking pictures compared with finepix s9500 that ive had for a few years now.
editing functions make interesting photos. love it.
still getting used to it, but if you don't want to bother with all the details just use auto and it gives amazing pictures
controls easy to get to don''t be put off by the instruction manual, the camera helps you out with info on lcd screen.
great camera which takes fantastically sharp shots.
good for beginers its impossible to take a bad photo.
brilliant. i bought it to get back into photography and do not regret it.
we only bought this camera to shoot video, and its fantastic!
first off i must explain i am a newcomer to dslr cameras, i have owned the 600d for a few weeks now and am thouroughly enjoying the experience. using the manual (online or the provided manual) i have found it fairly easy to find my way around the camera menus, functions etc. as seen from my rating score i find the camera more than fulfills my needs at least for the moment. in my opinion excellent value for money. i am also pleased with the pc software and instructions for the use of.
full featured and punches well above it's wieght for the price. a great feel and light wieght for an slr. the kit lens with the image stabiliser is a boost to the low light usage. where flash is not wanted and natural light is required for asthetic reasons. the 4 stops claimed is a little generous maybe, but a valuable asset that many with see improvements in their photography with. the hd video has to be a huge bonus for any slr user with a few lenses to use.
so far i've used the camera straight out of the box and not taken the time to read the book (canon 600d for dummies) i purchased for it. having only used point and shoot cameras previously i was really impressed with how easy it was to use and quickly learn. i was even more impressed with the quality if the images i was able to take. i would recommend that a uv filter is purchased and put onto the lens immediately before using it, i would also suggest purchasing a 10 speed sd card if you intend to use it for video
takes great snaps.good size for my larger hands.just feel really solid.love it.
love this camera. it has produced high quality pictures from every situation i have thrown at it so far. very easy to use, has auto settings if you are just setting out on your dslr journey but a whole range of features for those looking to get that little bit more from their photography experience. nice and light, very easy to carry and handle.
great camera good low light shots with image stabiliser lens.
brilliant auto iso setting
amazing camera. love the website delivered just on time. and i like it alot overall.
brilliant camera! excellent quality throughout with stunning results.
simple to use, all the controls are so easily assessed to make quick adjustments. also i like the live view shooting facility which wasn't available in my previous camera, the canon d400. i also like the large screen for viewing my results.
ease of use for both simple and complex tasks
i am a keen amateur and already have a dslr camera kit, i didn't want to get stuck with just one type of camera, so i looked for another dslr, which would give me more help when taking photo's, it takes cracking photo's and the suggestions for changing settings seem really helpfull.
very easy to use, i'm a first time user of this kind of camera and i the first time i used it took over 200 in two hours. so easy!
i have had no real experience with dslr's and so have little to compare it with.  it was easy to start taking photos with the intelligent automatic setting.  the choice of use of viewfinder or monitor, the swivel feature of the monitor and the touch screen control are all useful features.
easy of use, great for beginner
this is my first camera and happy to bit with it.
i am no professional photographer and yet the quality of photos achieved is amazing.  you can pick up the camera amnd without reading the inctrrsuctions you can start and take really good photo's.
it is awesome, very good camera, that lets you take great pictures even on the automatic settings but has the ability to let you get fully creative with the manual mode
just everything abiut camera is amazing.
easy to use, helpful interface.
good full hd video features
number of features and combined video and camera is great
excellent camera, high quality product produces high quality pictures
excellent choice of camera for those new to dslr`s
good quality and value for money.  very comfortable to handle.
the photos are fantastic and the camera is able to take photos in difficulty lighting.
over all a good quality camera for the money.
a superb digital slr with many professional features that re-awakens my enjoyment of photography and gives excellent results.
easy, intuitive design for the most used features.  beginning to use other more advanced assets and seems to be of similar ease.
this is my first dslr range camera, i've been wanting one for a while and finally decided to go for a canon eos 600d and let me tell you something this was the best camera i have bought in my life. very easy to set up, easy to use, fits perfectly in the hands, image quality is remarkable, overall you won't be disappointed with this camera.
good firm grip from body.great quality.acent package.
great camera. i researched dslr cameras for ages and asked around. the 600d does what it says. as a novice to this standard of photography my judgement will have to be reserved. but im liking it.
it is a fantastic camera to learn on but i suggest to get body only and get a better lense. the lense is not so great and i already bought a lense with a wider zoom range 18-200. although the better lenses are those with large fixed aperture. all in all a very good camera
profesional and very good quality
as for me, moving from the canon a1 to this one was because of image quality and ease of use.
image quality, build quality, features, ergonomics.
having a flip out and rotate lcd moniter is a great feature
great pictures and hd videos! brilliant for first time dslr users too, very clear layout and easily navigated. would recommend if you're looking for a good, quality first professional camera!
nice lens and faster
using the auto settings it is easy to get fabulous photo's every shot but it has all the fine controls for the professional photographer at an affordable price.
takes sme nice pictures
once you get the hang of it its very easy to use
large sensor, rotating display, viewfinder, good ranking site dp reviews, silver medal, good life battery.
this is my first dslr. i went for the 600d as it was the best camera for the price range i was looking at. i am very pleased with it!
really easy to use, takes a nice photo, good starter camera for someone serious about starting photography.
i was upgarding from a 300d so the quality of images was a big improvement and i love having the video option which is also great quality. the 18-135 is my first image stabilised lens the quality of which is good i haven't used it for motorsport yet when i expect to switch the is off.
i highly recommend
great easy camera to use.
easy to use
- an absolutely brilliant dlsr for those of you who want to get into the world of dslr photography and videography. this camera wwas my first dlsr and i've never been more pleased with a camera, works perfectly, image quality if brilliant, and the tilting screen comes in very handy when shooting at high or low angles.
live viewing on the 3 inch screen.
good build quality, feels comfortable in your hand, just the right weight.
recommended to us by someone that knows a lot about photography as an entry level camera with lots of good features and when we upgrade the body, the lenses will still fit.  so far we have had a good experience with the camera.
fantastic camera. very robust but not too heavy. fantastic picture quality. great features.
fast light good display
image quality and feel
a great cannon camera and lens, has that quality feel about it. it was fairly easy to set up for the basic use, and with  intial testing it was clear that the exposure controls were able to cope with demanding situations.
the inclusion of a macro lens in with the bundle price was a real bonus. the usability does not stray too far from standard canon usability meaning although i previously had a 400d i was able to pick this up and start using it almost instantly. the in-camera lens filter special effects are a nice touch also.
fast camera, relatively easy to use, however some funcitons are tricky to get used to.
live view, higher isos for low light situations, sd card integrated wireless flash and full hd movies.
good quality photos especially for a complete novice like myself. easy to use, and still learning about the camera features
easy to use and understand,a little effort will yield great reward.
excellent quality photos, very quick, quite light to hold. photography is complicated but once you know what you are doing it is easy to use.
first time with a dslr so hardly qualified to comment. more control and better images then compact.
once having digested manual, camera use is straight forward. results are staggeringly good. although having a plastic body, camera feels very well made and professional
still early days, but a super little champion this one is.
great camera with excellent features. image quality is great, the ability to shoot with an iso of 6400 allows indoor pictures to be taken with no flash giving a truer colour range. the camera switches on very quickly, it feels great in my hand and the swivel screen is a very handy addition. make sure you buy a class 10 memory card.
excellent quality camera that works fantastically in auto and even better when you start to use all the features
great advance on 500d no distortion on cropping pictures, great images and fast shooting nothing missed,best ever for ease of use,fantastic.
very good camera useful quality  image  and move just adjusted  as other functions, flash light button 0_+ to increase light and take it professional pictures. modern and too easy to use i definitely to recommended.....
gave it to a family professional to take some photos said it is great and have lot of useful features, photos are sharp and the colour is perfect.
it is easy to use, many standered settings which give a picture quality good. it need a  training for the photographer to study this good product to get best results in picture
a lot easier to use than other slr cameras i have used in the past. each mode has a description on the screen, allowing you to get the best from the camera without having to pick the manual up every time.
this gives excellent results whether still photographs or videos with plenty of options with the camera itself to make custom changes to pics using the camera itself. there is no doubt this is a photographers camera. at first i thought i would never use the semi automatic or manual settings but the camera has optional built in instructions to tutor you so you can't go wrong. with a choice of packages including  two lenses and a gadget bag.it's not just a camera  it's a leap into technology.
i'm a very keen street/fashion photographer and i'm a student so i didn't have loads of money to spend on a dslr, but i haven't been disappointed! image quality is fantastic, performs well in all weather conditions even the rain! small and light, very comforable! good battery life, so no need to buy an external battery grip. much better than anything that nikon could offer around the same price!
trusted canon brand
everything.
i upgraded to this camera from a small compact. good screen size,easy to use,love the extra zoom from the 18/135 lens. picture quality is great.manuel takes a lot of reading.
great picture quality for the price. very crisp lcd screen
excellent build quality, good video features. very good shutter speed for a not too expensive product.
there all good
gorgeous design with excellent features. easy to use with many aweseome filters (for example) to improve the image. it makes life more fun having a camera in hand and the images are spectacular - when you get it right.
an excellent camera producing wonderfull photographs on automatic and presenting me with a wealth of learning to look forward to.
excellent camera
having had the camera for a few months now,  i would just like to say chuffed i am with it.  it feels good in my hands to start with, all the buttons and setting changing controls easy to hand.  the battery life i am particularly impressed with,  shooting on full and fine,  it seems to last for ages,  i can go on a shoot all day confident that it will see me through.  the weight is good,  even with this larger 18-135mm lens,  i find handling it easy.  the quality of the shots are remarkable both for landscape and macro.  i say macro because, with 18 million pixels to use,  i can take a shot say, of a butterfly from quite a long-ways off,  crop the shot and still receive great result.  together,  i think the camera,  along with this lens combination give me,  versatility and after processing, great great shots.
great camera, images good quality. lens is good too at the wide angle end and focuses fast.  camera is easy to use and has variety of easy to use controls. software supplied with the camera is ok, but prefer photoshop.
my first foray in the world of dslr's. i really like this camera and its specs. only have it 2 weeks, no major issues so far!
it`a canon....all said...
everything!
the camera is nice and compact the very angle screen is a great for when your shooting high or low, auto settings are easy to use but manual setting will take some time to learn to use .
i like the feel and balance of this camera controls are easy to use and set
high quality. easy to use.  excellent build quality.
well pleased with the camera so far
a great entry level, yet professional feeling, slr digital camera. have used canon eos film cameras in the past and it can take all canon eos fit lenses. a great introduction to the canon digital camera system.
has many useful features
image quality is awesome! this is my second canon camera (first was 350d) and i love it. easy to use, all adjustments under your fingers, video shots - brilliant.

very good camera ,caters for my needs.
been using slr for years and have just up-graded to canon 600d, am very impressed, i found using it first more helpful and then referring to manual for extra help. picture quality is brilliant, and the camera feels good to hold. it came recommended from a friend who has used same camera for a while and has been more than impressed with it.
a good beginners slr which is exactly what i wanted and it enables me to learn and purchase extra items for this very popular camera.
good intuitive response, coupled with simple operative system -ideal for newcomers to dslrs.

great value for money, especially on the deal i got, worth looking out for.
the camera is very easy to use, the image quality is very good and it is surprisingly light.
great camera and well with eye-fi cards
overall a good camera had a 350d much better
bought as a present for my husband who was struggling with a old minolta 8 yrs old. he said this camera is fantastic. i now have loads of brownie points thank you sony...
amount of flexibility in being able to use camera as totally automatic or with varying levels of customization depending on the effect that you want to achieve.
high image quality, easy to use,good price
nice camera to hold esp as i have arthritis in my hands
a compact dslr, it allows you to decide how compex you want things to be, with many automated settings plus options for self-determined settings.  lightweight, smart and produces excellent quality images.
good solid feel to camera body, variable position lcd allows it to be closed when not in use  thus protecting the screen  controls in accessible places.when shooting.
value for money, well made, lots of info about this camera, lots of helpful hints
just an all round brilliant camera!
easy to work out - especially for a beginner.
well built camera - professional and uses high quality materials.

a joy
everything, overall a very good camera at a good price
easy to handle and automatic shooting styles information being shown on screen makes it simple to use.
picture quality is excellent; automatic programmes are very useful; compatible with my other canon eos lenses i bought 25 years ago; quiet when taking pictures; a very good all-round camera (not used the video element and doubt i will as have a camcorder); rechargeable battery pack; simple to change lenses.
ease of use, controls are well placed
this is an excellent entry level camera if you are serious about photography or just want excellent quality photos with no real fuss.
really easy to use, new to dslr always had point and shoot. started on full auto, now progressing onto the manual setting, show what settings are in auto in view finder so make it easier for a total beginner. not used any filters. tilt screen brilliant when in a crowd.
easy to get going in automatic modes - taking some wonderful shots 'off the bat.' good lcd screen. easy to handle amazing array of options and settings. very high qaulity video.
very light to carry,and small construction
ease of use. picture quality, build quality, value.
good value
good pictures with 18 megapixels. had 400d and quality was not as good
a really good camera for someone starting on a dslr. bought this an investment for some great photo's of the family growing up
it's a great relief to get back to an optical viewfinder.  my previous bridge camera was good but it had an electronic viewfinder. looking forward to exploring all its features.
excellent product, value for money
camera is well built and works well but did not come with the correct lenses.
easy to use
great camera really good quality pictures
great camera
excellent support.
my first dslr camera. find it comfortable to hold, all buttons in easy reach. image quality is excellent, took photo of the moon with 300mm lens but no tripod and you can still clearly make out craters and other details.
amazing camera with superb picture quality. very easy to use. canon is best.
good build quality, packed with easy to use features, brilliant picture quality.
readily easy to use the camera ( in auto mode ) and get immediate results.
excellent value for money.
excellent value for the price. lots of fun but you definitely have to read the manual to get the best quality.
great camera at a great price.
excellent quality photos due to the easy auto focus which takes over the management of all the functions and finds the best, sharpest setting for every shot.
stupendous feature-set for the price. great quality images. not too heavy. simple to use on automatic.
this is a great camera if you are a first step and keen amateur photographer. the image quality is excellent and both lenses (additional zoom supplied in the online bundle) are of good quality. the general interface is easy to use and the instruction book is straight forward and helpful. the camera works well with iphoto for editing basic quality images. the pre settings such as sport have produced some great results. this camera is all i need and is my first digital slr purchase. i really can't fault the camera.
image quality, ease of use.
this is my first dslr camera so i'm still trying to find my way around it, however i looked at a few other brands and found the canon to be the best for what i needed, the fact that you can rotate the screen to to aid with self takes is a great help as is the remote facilities  so you dont have to worry about timers, all in all very good value for money
great camera, perfect upgrade from point-and-shoot camera to dslr models.  have always used canon point-and-shoot cameras and the features plus software being similar, have made the move seamless.
easy to use. great picture quality
merci)
great phots and video quality!!
solid construction but not too heavy, 18mp gives excellent quality pictures. moveable viewer is a great asset. came with a spare battery, remote and canon strap. fairly easy to use once the instruction manual has been absorbed.
setting buttons are easy to access and use.
it's one darn good camera package a great click and go in auto mode. great software too
user dvd
great camera with lots of features
robust. image quality should improve with a bit more experience.
love this camera, this is my first dslr and it's great. i was debating whether to get the 550d or 600d but i'm glad i made the decision to spend a little bit more, it was definitely worth it.
great image quality, easy to use, professional standards, great value for money
point and shoot from the box.
very light weight and easy to use. love it.
easy to learn menu settings, plenty of customisable settings, swivel screen is a great feature. have not put this camera down since purchase!
large rear viewing screen.
this looks impressive and my husband is very happy with the present. i didn't want to spend a fortune but this camera seemed to tick all of the right boxes. it is a 'starter' camera for him and he's very happy-though we have nothing to compare it to in all honesty. there are features he's played with really easily eg different settings for different results eg warmth/cool.
fold out lcd display
all as hoped for
a brilliant bit of kit with a wide range of facilities for both beginner and skilled amateur
classic company
fantastic picture quality, easy to operate even for a novice.
all good
would recommend!!
bit heavy with the 18-135 lens but still very good have not had time yet to fully use the equipment because of bad weather
light compared to my old dslr. feels good in your hand and is easy to use.
canon is portable and it delivered the excellent work.
brilliant entry level dslr, really enjoying getting to know it. lots to learn!
easy to use camera for a novice like me, display is great, and has loads and loads of features
excellent intuative controls and easy to access from the top plate and back of camera.
upgrade on my 350d and there is a real improvement in picture quality and the video function is great.
this is an upgrade from my canon 400d nice new features i like the quick control button saves time and easy to use, the live view is good but as in my bad points could be better . price wise you get a lot for your money. great starter camera for new dslr users.
fantastic camera.  easy to use and understand functions.
easy to use, great value for money, and although not the best build quality it is still a very good camera for beginners and first time buyers. the image quality is very good and the camera also has many features.
this is my first dslr camera and i really didn't have so much trouble using it. during the first few days i was just using the auto mode and it made nice pictures.. now i'm exploring its different functions. i don't regret buying this camera.
shoot' to a more serious camera with good quality movies too.
ease of handling
this is a brilliant camera for a first dslr. as easy or tricky to use as you want to make it.

i have spent a long time considering the move to a quality slr digital camera. the reviews for this product were very good indeed and after 4 weeks of use i have found this to be an excellent product
good value for money.
tilting screen is perfect
this is a easy to use camera, however if you want to experiment, its proved to be good fun.
excelent pictures
very easy to use, as this is my first dslr and a big step up from anything i have had before so very happy.  good user interface and menus are straightforward to navigate.  love the flip screen, gives plenty of scope for over the head/low down shots.  not explored all the features yet as i'm still a newbie to it but feel its all the camera i'll probably ever need
video. nice display capable to move.
good menu clear  instructions and display
perfect size and weight!
the whole image stabilising stuff is excellent, and the image quality is great.
haven't yet mastered all its capabilities!
just full of qualitity and ease of use

compact, good screen with option of viewfinder
size, weight, features, picture quality, ease of use.
very neat, solidly-built camera with large display. also features an optical viewfinder, becoming very rare in a point-and-shoot. includes loads of features \x96 far too many to mention, but you can literally point and shoot in full auto and get very impressive results.
easy to use. good photo quality.

excellent build quality, excellent sharpness and versatility. light weight and handy size.
compact camera easy to use would have liked a manual with camera as opposed to have to download from disc. and a straight to mains from camera lead. but overall am very pleased with it.
the good points are the strong build quilty very good
quality of build and ease of use. in addition the size and weight is perfect
great image quality!
very easy to use with an excellent quality of picture

brilant little camera so easy to use you can just pick it up and  use it. experimenting with the features but so far i have nothing to complain about its all very good
it's easy to use - the quality is good.  i have to say, it's a great little camera and i'm really pleased with it!
slim compact design, features both an optical viewfinder and large active screen. bright sharp display. good video. good battery life. aesthetically pleasing.
i never give 10/10 as i believe you can improve on anything ........... but i nearly did with this product ... not one to study guide books ... i like to pick up and go , and thats just what i did with this camera ... its just soooo easy to use ... the pictures are great and i transfered to my pc with no problem !! this is the first digital camera i've had, so i cant compere to others ... but as a newbie to digital tech ..... i can't fault this camera .... money well spent !
very compact camera with pretty much all the features of a compact you could want.  built in accelerometer means that it knows which way up it is - very cool if you quickly want to see a portrait picture full screen.  great build quality.
small, robust and simple with good quality
smart,camera.easy to use
great camera and easy to use!
good solid build quality, large clear screen, small compact with some excellent freatures.
i'm not very technically minded - i get dizzy when i hear about mega pixels and zooms - however this has been very easy to use. the upload to the compuer routine is very good, and it's been dropped a few times and seems to bounce quite nicely with no ill effects. i'd recommend it.
i've had canon before and i love their stuff. this is no different. very solid camera, takes brilliant photos. lots of settings if you know what you're looking for and what to change for what you want - but i don't!
good quality for a good price
very compact and easy to use on auto settings
nice, compact design with an optical viewfinder, great for sunny conditions.  body feels nice and solid, metal, not cheap plastic. great value for money in terms of what the camera can do, has the basic automatic, point and shoot function but also allows for manual modes and different scenery options.  quality of images (10million pixels) is fantastic in a variety of conditions.  would definitely recommend, especially for beginners who want a decent quality camera but ease of use with great pictures.  very user friendly.
vibrant and authentic colour.
sexy design
light, easy to use . small. feels nice in the hand.
ease of use
compact, light, easy to use, good pictures
image quality and small size.
very good battery life; big screen; screen has very good picture quality and resolution; easy to use. we are very happy with the camera.
what you would expect from canon.
build quality. image and video quality. fantastically compact. great for slipping in a pocket and capturing unexpected shots.
right up to a skilled amateur. the battery life is also worth noting, i'm just back from a two week trekking holiday i took around 800 shots and used only a third of the power.
camera is lightweight but has a good look and feel.
the camera is great, simple easy to use, a good introduction into dslr photography. especially good i thought at the close up shots. lots of features
great standard lens and body
the canon eos 450d is packed with features, like a 3inch screen, live view mode, over 12 million megapixels giving beautiful clear picture results etc, it has many of the features of a much more expensive professional camera but it's body is less robust.  it is powerful enough to take the most demanding of shots yet light enough to be carried virtually anywhere, which is a plus point if you have a family of young children and carrying all of their essentials as well.  this is my second canon eos and in my opinion it makes an excellent mid range dslr choice.
the image quality with the (new) kit lens is quite acceptable, in fact much better than i expected and seems to be capable of resolving the extra pixels. the is works very well enabling hand held low light shots to be taken (e.g. inside churches) without pushing the iso too much. very impressed with the sensor, good dynamic range and low noise at iso 800 (which makes it very usable if necessary). i find the camera handles well, together with being fairly light and (relatively) compact.
large, clear lcd display. very comfortable to hold, nice weight and feel. controls nicely positioned. takes great pictures with the kit lenses. this is my first dslr and i chose it because my old canon ae1 finally died. i'm very pleased with this excellent camera.
canon produce some of the best camera's in the business.  this is no exception!  i purchased this camera in prepartion for my sisters wedding, however, since receiving the item i have yet to leave it alone. plenty of features, comfortable to work with and quite light even with the lens attached.
excellent camera, great picture quality, loads of usefu features, quick to get use to the basic use.
the tamron zoon lens is far better than the canon offered by the same price (i have tested both).  the 4 gigabyte memory card is more than enough for beginners and the camera features and potential is superb.  when testing against sony alfa 14 megapixels, there is no difference at all in the quality results.
purchased to take pictures of my new baby and already 2 weeks on i have stunning pictures imortalising the little monkey. it was worth every penny. oh yes and it takes the odd work photo too.........
everything.  great camera.
this camerra is just so easy to use but with the benefits of letting you experiment with the professional side  of things by adjusting the settings. i would recommend this camera purely because it makes all the  pictures i take look like they are from a magazine or out of an art gallery. i am now being asked to a lot more parties just because any pictures i take with the  canon 450d aare just the best.
absoloutly love it - my first digital slr and doesn't disappoint. really easy to use and taken some great photos.
easy to use
i opted for the 450d over the 500/550d because of the lack of video shooting and the improved performance in low light conditions. i find the 450d produces less noise than the high resolution 500 series because of the lower mpixel count.
light and easy to manage even if you wear glasses.
an exelent camera if your stepping into the world of dslr and want a bit more than the entry level cameras have to offer. highly recomended
the tamron zoom lens is well built and well balanced for ease of use however this lens is a fraction slower to focus and firmer to select the zoom setting than the canon lens.
accepts all canon's lenses
ease of use. quick easy set up and simple to follow instructions.
lighter than expected, twin lens bundle covers most ranges, good battery life and all main functions to hand i.e. iso, white balance, focus, continuous shooting etc.
large screen at rear, viewfinder bright and large (although i am used to a bigger slr one)
easy to get fantastic looking photos, and the buttons are laid out well. good value for the price
had a digital camera and have had quality cameras all my life, but this dslr is brilliant. have been taking exceptional wildlife photos.
display is good, all info in a readable format size
a great little camera for both snap happy people and the more experienced photographer.
perfect package to get you started.  good build quality and feature rich.
easy and fun to use.  reliable. point and shoot and creative options makes this a very flexible photographic tool.  clear, concise menu options.  battery life good.  lens changing quick and easy.
every thing
well designed product, with excellent features, ergonomically sound
small, light and excellent canon quality
super quality pics, even from the 'automatic' settings - learn what the 'manuals' do, and the sky's the limit!. very good lcd screen, easy to read, and lots of info....
overall i am loving it, haven't used a camera out of auto for years but finding my way around the camera quite easily, picture quality is amazing started up an old hobbie best xmas gift  find it hard to put it down :)
ease of use. an absolute beginner can be taking photographs in minutes
excellent image quality
amazing camera and extremely easy to use.
i love it !
the overall quality of the product is very good and the value for money with the twin lense's was exceptional
weight, fits in the hand well.  mostly easy to use.  image quality of standard 18 -55 lens is fine.  convenient sd card memory format.
light compact
fast start up time
this is our first dsl camera and love using it
nice large screen, and plenty of features
easy to use.the lense is brilliant and the pic quality is excellent.
good quality pictures
feels like professional quality camera.  totally the right move from a high spec compact to this model.
easy to use, good range of equipment and lenses that can be added on. great image quality and high speed shooting works well. built in
compact, easy to understand, up and running quickly with good results
this one has been very carefully designed to make it easy to use and to access all of its features.
simple to understand instructions, ease of use from day one of purchase especially if first dslr, comfortable to hold and use even with the large lens in kit,
been really pleased with results so far.  have used both lenses.  the 70-300mm has had more use as taking closeup photos of my grandchildren.  only used in auto mode and p mode so far.
design, easy way round it, coming from compact digital to slr means i've got plenty of learning to do, but the instruction manual is more than useful
all great!
simple to use dslr.
easy to use if you've never used a dslr before and easily accessible functions such as iso and wb
easy to use - even for a novice to slr's
an excellent entry camara with almost all the features of a mid range camera. very light and comfortable to use even over long periods.
i learn because i had an old camera. but it's completely diffrent from what i had. excellent camera
reasonably easy to use for someone who doesn't know a huge amount about photography.
excellent camera and kit,easy to use and excelent picture quality!!!! i just love it!

large screen, live view. quite easy to use. takes great pictures and has high fps for shooting moving images.
although still learning what my first slr can do i am very impressed with the quality. even with a large lense it is relatively light and comfortable to hold.  changing settings, deleting images and uploading photos to a pc is easy to do and the softward provided is very good to get you started. i am astounded at the image quality, fab!
lightwait and easy to use
great value, lots of options and control over shooting. everything a beginner could want in an affordable package.
weight. live-view. image quality.

a good all round camera for a reasonable price.
the is lens is outstanding and the 300mm macro/zoom lens, although not as high quality as the canon lens, has allowed me to really experiment with a range of subjects. both jupiter and a close-up of a garden spider with the same lens, not bad!
handling, large lcd screen, features
exellent camera and lenses. easy to use from day 1 + lots of options still to explore.
easy to use and nice big lcd screen
easy to use in auto mode and has plenty of creative settings meaning cracking pics
very easy to use. 2 lenses for the price of one.
easy to use, picture quality is brilliant!
it is a light camara that is easy to handle. fantastic quality photo's.
easy to use
clear instructions. easy to use.  good feel
good selection of features. good picture quality. enjoyable to use. second lens provides particularly good value to the package.
easy to get started,
lots of settings, including fully manual. outstanding value for money.
as an entry level camera its excellent
so far i have found it relatively intuitive to use and it seems fairly idiot-proof.
ease of use
fantastic image quality if you are thinking of moving up to a dslr i would highly recomend the cannon eos 450
weight, size, clarity of image, display screen size, great user manual
havent had the camera long so still getting used to it, but i've just used it a friends wedding and everything turned out really good........... time will tell
it waas easy to produce really good pictures, even with only a little photographic experience before using the canon. the intrface is much more user-friendly than other cameras which boast similar specs. also, the larger three inch screen is a real bonus.
very light wieght easy to use
all good.  excellent value for amount of features.  highly recommend.
easy to use
excellent image quality with a easy to follow menu system.
first rate performer and easy to use.
light weight, compact, easy to use with information from the manual
very simple to use and very adjustable when you have the time.
good quality, easy to use but i have not had much opportunity to use it a lot yet. i will be taking it abroad next year.
i am a beginner in digital photography and have found this camera easy to use. just took it on holiday and it performed excellently with no problems.
easy to use.  good value.
nice camera, fairly easy to get the hang of and produces really nice pictures. overal very pleased.
great quality pictures, and very easy to use.
very easy transaction - competative price.
easy to use and very good pictures
has everything in the box to just get out there and start taking awesome pictures.
it is compact and lightweight and easy to handle.
the camera is very light to handle and for a relative new person to dslr very good to understand.
an excellent all round package
easy to use and absolutely great picture quality.great value for money too.
excellent camera and kit,easy to use and excelent picture quality!!!! i just love it!
this is our first dsl camera and love using it
weight, fits in the hand well.  mostly easy to use.  image quality of standard 18 -55 lens is fine.  convenient sd card memory format.
fast start up time
super quality pics, even from the 'automatic' settings - learn what the 'manuals' do, and the sky's the limit!. very good lcd screen, easy to read, and lots of info....
easy to use, picture quality is brilliant!
lens quality good
great all rounder - excellent pics with 20x optical zoom and hd movies. multiple pre-set settings for various shooting conditions.
wanted a camera that would be a compact but also give me quality pictures like a slr.  this camera does it all :)... don't get me wrong it's not a nikon d90 or a canon eos 50d, but saying that the functions are well balanced and take's great photo's..  now i have had one, wouldn't swap it for a d90 or a 50d...  maybe a canon 7d or 5d mark2....  /dream
very flexible camera, good telephoto ability - just come back from safari - camera was excellent to get some good close up shots
great range of useful features plus the fantastic 20x zoom with is that works well for me.
lots of great features such as panaroma and colour swap give you the opportunity to experiment.
-good accurate colour balance sensors and light detection sensors
unique feature set, fantastic zoom range, handles almost like a slr,. excellent ergonomics, fast processor, good looks (similar to canon eos cameras), decent build quality. a true hybrid device (camcorder/photo camera).
very good at focusing at distance, still have a lot to learn as there is a lot to understand to gain full use of camera
easy to operate
the camera is of the high standard and quality you expect from canon giving excellent results.  being a bridge camera it is just what i wanted with slr facilities but not the need to keep changing lens for different situations.  i would highly recommend this camera to anybody who is looking for more than an ordinary compact but not wanting a full blown slr.  in short it is solidly built good quality canon camera with lots of scope for the beginner to advance with.
hdmi is fantastic.
excellent quality camera, gives lovely pics and easy to use.
good build quality and image quality
feels good and solid, and easy to pick up the basics. even for a complete novice like me.
i have not had much time to use it yet but so far it seems extremely good.
excellent camera overall...................
easy to use with excellent picture quality . the moveable preview screen is very handy
easy to use and very intuitive.
excellent image quality.   excellent build quality.   compact and comfortable to hold.   controls are intuitive and considering the range of features are the best i have experienced.   face recognition is effective and very useful
small, light and pocket size. good quality photos can be achieved. it is great as a point and shoot but also has manual settings for more advanced use.
build,battery life,image quality
solid and robust. brilliant quality photos, very quick off to ready time.
overall i am extremely pleased with this little gem, and feel it was well worth the effort of researching the market.  and worth the effort of reading the 170 page user guide.  if you want a lot more than a snap-shot camera, download the ixus 980 is full specification and get ready for some real enjoyment!
small good to put in pocket
there are numerous good points.  the camera is feature packed and spec'd to a level which you'd expect to find in a dslr.  the pre-programmable print button is great feature for assigning various options (i've assigned mine for one touch manual white balance control- great for vivid underwater shots [although the scene underwater mode is also excellent]).  the battery life is great, build quality superb and image quality fantastic.  having just returned from a diving trip to scapa flow (orkney's) i now have a sdhc card with over 300 high res images both on land and underwater.  it'll be a struggle to decide which ones to print, as there are many gems!  these cameras are a must for any diver wanting to purchase a camera with manual white balance control, without running to the expense of a dslr.  the camera is a doddle to operate and the supplied software allows for a good degree of post image editing.....not that you should really need to with this camera in your pocket!  for those wishing for a similar spec but with a large zoom i'd suggest the g10, which has the same number of features but comes with a larger zoom lens.
handy size that packs in a good file size, easy to slip int your pocket.
the camera is a little chunkier than the ixus 55 but you hardly notice it due to the overall quality of the product. definitely well worth buying this camera. i spent ages researching this item and found it to be a lot cheaper on this website.
excellent image quality, even in low light conditions. the 'auto' setting is adequate for pretty well any conditions or situations that i have so-far encountered. it's very useful to have a viewfinder, an item that is beginning to disappear from digital cameras. the movie-clip quality is very high, including the sound. in an editing suite it's almost impossible to distinguish between the video from the ixus and the video from my sony handycam. the camera is very small and light and an underwater housing is available for scuba.
very neat and compact mid-price camera with a good feel in the hand. small enough to carry around easily. gd lcd quality. still v new so haven't had a chance to explore all the features.
hi res, nice handling
great auto feature where you can point n take resolution makes even paper prints are excellent quality
great compact camera that has it all!
size. manual controls
very high build quality, easy to use, great camera for the price.
very small and light. sharp lens and high pixel count are adequate for selective enlargements. a4 prints are sharp edge to edge, a3 prints are pixel free. manual (etc) options make it very flexible for creative shots. feels well made. surprisingly good flash coverage. joy of joys, it has a viewfinder.
this camera has lots of features, we particularly like the colour accent setting. the picture quality is very good and easy to take good pictures.
image quality above all, great build quality, excellent features
amazing camera. so easy to use and great pictures.
viewfinder, and predictive focussing.
image quality. loads of features.
small neat simple to use and fits in my pocket.
image quility, especially in low light. optical viewfinder. manual settings
all in all a very good point and shoot camera but with all the features of a 35mm camera you can do just about anything with all of the settings
it had so many good points it is difficult to pick out just one or two.   i certainly found many things that i didn't have on my other digital camera which gave me a much wider menu to pick from, also the number of pixels which i can now control and use less if i want to. .
i have just downloaded the first images off it. i have to say they are excellent.i have found it easy to use.but so far have only used the automatic function.
excellent product. although i have larked 'ease of use' down, the only reaon for this is that as it has leading features in 'manual' mode that require learning, it would naturally not be as simple to use in this mode as other 'just auto' camers. that said, in manual mode, it's excellent.
light, small and should be easy to use once mastered.
the macro was brilliant, very easy to check live focus, it will be great for small criters like the pigmy sea horses and nudibranch.
build quality
all what i need fron a point and shoot
manual white balance
very easy to use as point and shoot but with plenty of manual control if wanted. great zoom, cd quality  sound on video, zoom works in video mode and is very quiet, not picked up on the sountrack of any i have shot. viewfinder adequate for setting up shots with all the information you need. swivel screen makes taking shots above or below eye level easy. although video is not hd it looks great on 32'' hd screen.
speed of start-up, colour balance, quality of image, range of settings, ease of use, image viewer, zoom
simple to use, stunning zoom. use an sdhc ultra iii and airshows are easy
it is excellent for taking architectural features on buildings, even when they are at the top of spires/towers.
easy to use good over long distance without having to change lenses the automatic lens does it all for you. for someone who wants good quality pictures without the difficult technology that some cameras have, this is easy to use and great quality for the money
the flip out screen is really useful (especially for short people to look over others or round corners!).  there is a wide variety of settings.  because of the aa batteries it is quite heavy but it does mean you can change the batteries in the middle of the day!
why carry the extra weight and bulk when this has 95% of an slr's capabilities.
easy automatic or creative manual control. smaller than a dslr but almost as capable. superb image quality.uses standard aa batteries.
simple to use
best camera for the money in its range.
good solid slr replacement for occasional photographers with video and stereo sound.
time lapse.
cracking lens and image quality - sharp, natural colours.
i bought this as an update for the sx1is as i had found this to be a great camera but it has sadly gone wrong. the update to 20x optical zoome is amazing. i find the camera easy to use as separate dials/buttons do different things rather than having to trawl through a menu on a single control. it feels sturdy in the hands and makes photography comparable to my old film slr but with the bonus that you don;t have to worry about wasting film.
why buy a dslr !
as soon as you pick the product up you can feel the quality and when you come to use it you realise that feeling was correct
one lens instead of 3.    easy to carry and use.
has hot shoe for flash
terrific camera....the super zoom with image stablisation is great. i like the bigger feel of the camera and this suits me. with a little knowledge, you can achieve almost anything that you want
well made and easy to use on auto. fantastic lens and fantastic anti shake feature. good stereo sound. feels good in the hand. my best camera so far.
shot modes produce excellent results with little or no effort.  intelligent face recognition that follows your face, multi af settings galore, the list goes on and on.  the colours it produces are vibrant and realistic and in low light it does a decent job even at long focal lengths.  if you're brave, you can set this baby into full manual and configure everything to your heart's content.  i think the best mode is 'program mode'.  you can also attach a standard flash beam or additional lenses/filters. this camera is almost slr quality but for digital camera money.  have i mentioned it does wide-screen photos too?
well-designed and easy to handle with good locations for the controls.
did everything expected and more, first rate.
everything
low price.
as a novice photographer with the will to learn and improve i found this camera very good and have already taken a vast variety of photographs using all gadgets, focal length light  and choice of lense.
excellent pictures with low light.  battery life good.  choice of 18-55mm and 75-300mm lenses gives a good range which should suit most applications.
good introduction to slr photography
it is reccomended as a good camera for a first time user of slr. it certainly lives up to its billing . so  far i have  really enjoyed using it and been able to take some very good wildlife shots
ideal camera for a beginner... straight forward and easy to use... some cool little features
camera very easy to use.  documentation is superb and easily understandable.  pictures taken are really high quality both for portraits and landscapes.  i have used canon products before and this purchase does not disappoint.
easy to use for a non-expert, and the 2 lenses cover most needs.
it's fairly light, however be aware that when you put the larger lenses on it can get pretty heavy if your using it for a long time without a tripod.
very good deal with the lens kits and bag
offers good facilities for the price and can form the basis of your entry into digital photography.
simple to use
image quality is just great, much better than i expected. really am impressed. video is amazing too. very light weight, i carry mine in shirt pocket it`s so small. battery life is ok, altho i`d recomend carrying a spare as back up. start up time for first shot is very quick.
simple to use in auto mode, spend time exploring the features and be even more amazed what this little camera can do. i bought it to use at a friends wedding and got some fantastic pics, i used it for about 14 hours taking pictures and recording hd videos on the day and the battery ran out when it was time to leave the wedding party. i viewed the pictures and videos on the telly and was really impressed! all in all, if you want a small camera that does so much and record hd videos with great functions and ease of, i would thoughly recommend this camera.
nothing was straight). image quality is fine for a camera of it's size. it's not amazing quality compared to the 90is or something bigger, but for an ultra compact with this many features i don't think you could get much better.
great little camera. i was almost going to get the cybershot but this cannon takes much better quality pictures when printed. it's very little, so perfect for the pocket or handbag. i only use the auto setting, but will aim to investigate the manual settings as i think i could take some great shots manually.
video quality are amazing compared to my last sony camera.
love the colour accent feature - you can select a colour that stays and the rest goes black and white! also fab macro images. i love this camera!!!!!
light camera at a good price. this is easy to use once you understand the available settings.
it's tiny! can easily fit in the same pocket as my phone. it has intelligent auto so is great as a capture anything point and shoot
size.auto/manual settings.high megapixals.quick start-up
small compact and easy to use but delivers very good results.
love it love it, very crisp photos and all the photos come out very good. the design is so sleek and mine (red) is a great colour to have, its easier to see the buttons in the red colour than say, the gold one.
excellant value camera - easy to use
delivery and service excellent.
it is a fab little camera - it takes excellent photo's,it is really wasy to use and looks great. it also has an optical view finder which is good if you are wanting to save battery power.
this is an awesome, lightweight camera which is great for on the move.  you can show off your camera in style.  i say go for it!!!!!!!!
good sound recording.
a brill little camera,which i found easyto use
small size. macro close-up is easy and excellent. overall performance is good. had an earlier version so knew roughly what was on offer.
its a great compact camera that looks great
great product and small size.
i found the camera easy to use with the basic controls comfortable to manage. i have been particularly impressed with the hd video quality.
very small, large lcd size, quick to save images.
optical viewfinder.
5) i bought it for someone else and deliberately went for as few buttons as possible. however, there are a very useful set of shooting modes available.
very compact, perfect for slipping in pocket  or bag. looks smart, takes great pictures. very little camera shake, but if it's a problem just use kids and pets setting. my last camera was a canon ixus 70 which was brilliant but died due to water damage, and was pleased that not only were the controls and menus very similar, but the batteries were identical, so i already have a spare. haven't printed any photos yet, but they look great on screen.
has all the features of my previous ixus cameras plus some extra. the hd video is great and saves the need for a camcorder and although its not full 1080 hd (720 i think) can anyone actually tell the difference anyway?!
brilliant picture quality have an earlier model,  also slimmer in size is great for putting in handbag took it to las vegas at new year it performed better than expected night and day with auto focus and hardly any shuddering on all pictures
small, quality shots, easy to use
really nice and compact.  very solid build.  easy to use and easy to view pictures.  really happy with it.

straight forward to use
i love this camera, it is small, compact and easy to use. i also decided to get this one as it had an optical view finder, which is now disappearing from most digial cameras!!
small enough to fit easily in your pocket. great to have a veiw finder as well as a display.
bought for my husband and he's been very pleased with it so far. he keeps telling me he's found more features - he didn't spend much time reading the manual when he got it! i couldn't believe how small it is. the view finder is very small too, but seems to line up well. recommended.
fantastic camera, very small size, takes great pictures during a day and at night
a neat little camera that does all it says on the box
excellent small compact camera,brilliant video and sound. why buy a video camera when this one gives good results,software easy to use,the extra viewfinder is a boon on very sunny days.best digital camera i have ever purchased.
ease of use, intuitive, great quality
small size, price, image quality, the best !!!
i cant think of anything bad very pleased with the camera small compact east to use.

i love this camera! small enough to fit into my pocket and very easy to.  i'm amazed at the quality of the video camera.  early days but so far no problems!
compact good screen optical viewfinder
all round good performance
it's really easy to use and has great picture and sound quality
excellent results, easy to navigate menu
eye piece viewfinder as well as screen which avoids problem of bright sunlight on screen when using. good zoom. good battery life. lightweight and easy to carry in a pocket.
packs so much into a small package. selling point for me was that a viewfinder is included, rare on tadays cameras. vey useful in bright sunlight when screen is hard to use.
battery life
great product for the money. ideal just to slip into pocket when out and about. image quality is excellent as is flash performance indoors. highly recommended for those who want a camera for parties / nights out and for those who always like to have a camera with them but don't want the bulk of a digital slr
outstanding quality pictures and hi-def video. very quick to turn up - no delay taking photos (never miss a special moment!). hd video recording is amazing - better than having a camcorder at 720p resolution. the thinnest camera i have seen with these features - slips into jeans pockets with ease. recommend getting a genuine canon case and a large sd card (minimum 8gb)
packed full of features. images are of a very high quality. camera itself looks classy. very small in size but with an good sized lcd screen
really nice and sleek, lots of features crammed, great for photos for events etc
small, lightweight, large viewer, there's also a viewfinder for seeing subjects in bright light, great canon lens quality.
i have adapted a belt pouch so i carry it with me all the time, even in work.
quality of shots on automatic mode is brilliant. it is particularly good indoors and with portraits. the camera is stylish and attracts admiration. it has a viewfinder - a feature you don't usually get with such cameras.
size, picture quality and ease of use
compact.
small and easy to use.
then this camera must be considered.
excellnet compact camera - i love it!
lots of automatic features that constantly adjust the settings for you (all you notice is the icons in the corner).
the battery life is brilliant on it too - i have used it allot and only had to recharge once in the last 3 weeks.
it's a very good balance between size/zoom/other features and easy to carry around unobtrusively.
easy to use, small for convenience, pictures are  very good quality
compact and well designed
easy to use, compact size, image quality.
image very clear and sharp
this camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures.
great picture, fully auto for those who dont know how to operate a camera. decent enough video footage to get rid of exsisting camcorder.
canon ixus 100 is isso far, all that i require for my standard of photography.
image quality is really good outside especially the colors. really nice design! overall a really fine pocket camera!
it's easy to use, it takes fantastic pictures and it's a really nice design.
good looking and easy to hold.  can take this camera everywhere.
size
size and weight
i bought this for underwater use and the ease of use and access to controls is excellent.  picture quality is amazing compared with my previous olympus muji.
exellent point and shoot compact amazing how much in so little camera
a neat compact little camera that doesn't have too many features to make it complicated. great if you want a camera for taking holiday snaps that fits in your pocket.
it was very simple  for me to use as i'm not a professional photographer.
good small easy to use camera.
quality of the lens and photos produced. number of pixels. size  - amazingly small
compact, good picture quality for a small camera
great size, ease of use, good amount of features. a bargain!
small .... very portable... tons of features...
good quality pictures
very light compact camera. whilst it is not canon's latest model, on average it produces excellent quality photos
this is a great go-anywhere camera. superbly portable and wonderful images - including reduced light. i have used it every day for 3 weeks on holiday and the battery was still almost full - after over 160 images. an excellent buy.
excellent all round camera for any type of user. nice small size and a really crisp picture.
simple to use
it takes good quality photos and videos, plus it has loads of useful features like rotating pictures.
takes great photo's very easy to use.
fantastic camera, amazing video, best digital camera in its price rage and higher well happy with this buy :)
compact.
will also record video in hd.
ideal for slipping into handbag or pocket, no bulk. being a 'point and shoot' user it is very easy, however i have been tempted to experiment a little. having a viewfinder was really important for me as i have difficulty with the screen when it is sunny. so far i am delighted with the camera.
easy to carry.tele photo good.quality and photos very good.
compact, light weight. has auto iso, hd video. for the amateur and as a tourist photography.
great pictures, very compact and easy to carry.
very compact and all in all takes a great photo.
takes very good and fast photo's, perfect for my wife storing it in her handbag ready to take pics of the kids at the drop of a hat. if you are expecting a camera with slr like zoom etc then this won't be what you need, if however you want a good solid camera for taking quick photo's and that gives a good picture and is very compact then this one will fit the bill. filled with good and well thought out features that some at twice the price struggle to have, excellent picture quality for such a small camera. it takes loads of photo's on one battery charge. all in all a good buy. i'd say the best camera in its range
value for money
the fact it is so small means you can pop it in your pocket and carry it around a;ll the time so i find myself taking much more pictures that i did with my old compact camera.
all round performance
cute and easy to use. can pop it into my bag and take it everywhere
its very small for carrying around. takes good pictures but havent used it enough to comment further
small, extremely portable yet still takes lovely pictures and preserves the manual settings that i love about canon cameras.
sleek design.
good camera, good quality images, small and fits easily into any pocket, and good choice of features. brilliant for beginers with auto flash as it recognises images and faces. smart little thing. long battery life
!
small and compact
great size and it looks good and on teh whole instinctive to use

its just such a compact versatile camera i have taken with me every where i go and i have travelled all over central america for over seven months the camera was great.
very good image quality, strong and nice build
small, good battery life, easy to use, great video, fast power up.
size and ease of use
very compact with reasonable battery life and takes a decent picture. has a view finder as well for sunny days on the ski slopes!
amazingly there are very few compact cameras now available with viewfinders. anyone who has tried to take pictures outdoors cannot usually compose their picture without, even with additional shields (have noticed even canon is stopping this feature-which is stupid). camera neat and compact. not yet had a lot of use but have taken both still and video.
great for travelling.  fits into any pocket
very little delay on shutter
great screen - no need for viewfinder after all.
living in malta with bright sunlight all year round, i needed a good camera with an optical viewfinder. this is the best i found in the category and the price range i was seeking.
great size, small and light.
i love it. found myself constatly fiddling with the settings trying everything out ot get better photos and got the rewards

the camera is very handy, easy to use. i use it as a second camera to my dslr. i don't always have the dslr on me but the ixus 100 is always in my pocket ready to shoot and i love it. i can take pictures whenever i need to and the quality is very good and it also features hd movies which is pretty impressive.
i like the fact that it has a viewfinder.  i don't need to put my reading glasses on to take a picture and if it is very bright the screen is sometimes difficult to see.  lovely photos particularly if subject is moving.  i took some great photos of my grand daughter jumping in the water on holiday.
excellent picture quality and small enough for even my small handbags. very easy for point and shoot use, but the programmable mode will take longer to master.
very compact, simple to operate, having a viewfinder, good size screen

compact, light and fits in handbag with ease.   very well made.   fast operation and impressive auto macro feature.
very compact,fits into a small handbag. cool looking design. can use in bright sunlight,because of the viewfinder.
good all round - and compact camera
i wanted a camera that was really easy to use, that takes great photo's and that is what i got.
controls very easy to use.  on screen menu self explanatory.  large display screen.  zoom control incredibly easy to operate.  picks out faces and shows green box around the central focussing element.  by moving the camera slightly, you can change where the camera focuses.  excellent battery life.  can see on screen how many shots you have left.  instruction book very easy to understand.  auto setting makes point and shoot very simple and produces excellent results.
size, image quality and robustness of build.
night mode. size. build quality
great easy to use canon again !
all covered above. this is a superb camera which is very easy to use and takes excellent photographs.

fantastic camera. very fast.i love it.feels like a 'real' camera, very solid construction.
the programed night mode is brilliant had great success with it. the autofocus system seams to lock on and give great pictures every time even in quick snap mode picking birds out of a leafless tree.well pleased with this camera.
it is just a great camera,
this product has excellent scope with numerous features and optional accessories for producing high quality exposures of a wide array of different style of various subjects.
overall i am very happy with this camera.
lovely camera to use. great images with my 24-85. nice to have a proper camera again.
easy to use, good quality pictures. similar feel and design to f80.
a typical nikon - good solid feel and produces excellent quality output. the large screen makes reviewing images a breeze. mac users, get the nikon raw converter for aperture, plug in and go.
high spec and good build quality. it has a good array of features and the controls are easy to find. comprehensive menu which is easy to navigate. the camera feels substantial in the hands without feeling bulky.
solid build, great image quality, spot metering, 10 mp, very easy to use.
the nikon d80 is a brilliant camera, in a hour or so it seems like you have owned it for years it is so easy to use, the image quality is very good.
very fast focus-tracking ability comparing to canon 350d. very good handling and clear menu.
handling is excellent, all function buttons are at fingertips.  in camera menus are simple to configure.
far better features and pictures than nikon d100.
fast and reliable workhorse, good battery life and extensive features makes the eos30d a joy to use.
as i expected from nikon the camera is very good.  as it is my only camera it fits with my ability, and what i was prepared to spend. i also purchased a 18-200 vr lens to go with the camera.
any hesitation to move from film to digital is blown away by this camera.
a well put together camera with superb picture quality, excellent features and very easy to use.
picture quality.  robust build.  speed of response.  lcd monochrome panel useful in bright light where the colour display is harder to see.
serious camera combines sophisticated slr with powerful digital processing. handles well, copes with everything from point and shoot to creative work.
chunky, robust and high quality camera, easy to hold and use. we've got the ultra-wide angle lens fitted as an option, and the panorama shots are truly impressive. large lcd screen for reviewing images, all the controls fall neatly to hand, and for the price, you get a lot of pixels for your money.
big solid build.  plenty of camera to hold onto if one has large hands. very user friendly.  very good quality pictures.
as you would expect with anything canon it's fantastic, the build quality is spot on, no loose bits or things that just dont quite work. mines been through the sahara desert, and always continues to do exactly what it says on the box.
great camera. delighted
this is a great camera with excellence image quality and very simple to use, its also has a very large screen which with zoom and crop image features
among us. the ability to manipulate shots  after taking them  allows for errors when using non cpu lens.
it's a nikon product which gives it a flying start. layout and function are familiar from d50 experience. 10 mpixel resolution is just right for my purposes to enable cropping of images and still be able achieve good sized prints. it has more facilities (d-lighting, extra focus points, etc.) than my previous d50 - with which i was very pleased.
brilliant clear photos
good size display, excellent image quality, the overall weight and feel of the camera lets you know you are holding a good quality slr. in automatic mode a child could not fail to take a decent picture.
everything about this body is fantastic!
very high quality of equipment.
very fast, easy to navigate menu, buttons in the right places, quality feel
the software suite with the camera is also very good although it isn't a photoshop.
great camera excellent image quality
contains a lot of the features of the more expensive d200 without the extra bulk of that camera.  as light and portable as the d50 but with more quality and advanced features.
a great digital slr camera with superb image quality and easy to use features. this allows me to get use out of my various lens originally used for 35mm with good quality printing upto to a3.
slightly expensive, but still the best of its type
awsome for digital picture quality even hand held. head and shoulders above any other camera i have ever used.
straight forward to use. lightweight compared to a d200
image quality and easy to use menu.
a good range of extra lenses is available which i am sure i'll get into at some point in the future.
it's a professional camera, it takes professional pictures. it has a good solid feel. it does low light shots very well.
very easy for an idiot like me to pick up and use with hardly any expireance of using a digital slr before.
the eos 30d is very well built and the images are excellent.
solid build quality
great for the new digital slr user and also for the vetern
build quality, ease of use.
although i am a beginner it is very easy to use out of the box with automatic functions to sort every need.  there is a wealth of functions avaliable on this camera which means you have a wealth of new things to try when you move over to various manual modes.
image quality.
well made solid feel, confortable to hold. excellent image quality, brings out lots of detail. menu and menu access is easy, all buttons seem well thought out and fall to hand easily. viewfinder is extrememly good, as id the large colourful rear display. the camera is on and ready to use instantly.
handles nicely, well balanced with my 28-200 nikon zoom.
continues the nikon quality and performance
it's quite a flexible camera.
great handling camera with plenty of great features for the discerning amatuer. fantastic high iso performance and image quality. the kit lens is an ok starter lens but to take advantage of the fantastic cmos sensor, quality glass is recommended. i have the ef-s 17-55 f2.8 is and ef 70-200 f4 is which are ideal companions for walkabout. i also have some specialist primes for more creative shots. that's the big advantage of d-slr
large lcd, comfortable solid handling and super-quick ai-servo focusing
ergornomic to use, all round performer for the money
very fast (compared to my old 300d), large buffer so can run off a long series of shots.
exposure using flash excellent. easy to use. solid build quality. good lense in package for price and image stabilizer works well.
ease of use, battery life, image quality
excellent all round camera.
my previous camera was a d70 and the transition was very easy.  really pleased with it - so far no bad points.  excellent build quality.  very pleased to have made the upgrade.
excellent advances in technology and useability.
ease of use of the many menus.  once familiarised, the speed with which one can navigate through the multitude of options is outstanding
easy to use for normal shooting, even better pictures than the 300d that it replaced.
excellent camera, especially when twinned with a good lens.
ease of use and build quality
auto focus is superb
i was recommended to buy this camera by my tutors at college where i am a mature student.  i do not regret my purchase at all.  the 30d gives me a great deal of scope in photographic terms to do everything i want.
speed, battery life, quality of build and images
solid feel, very easy to use and excellent picture qualities. many in-camera features, e.g. for image manipulation. this is my first dslr and so far teh experience has been everything i could have hoped for.
reputation for robustness
comfortable in the hand, solid construction no body movement under pressure
shoot to total manual control.covers just about everything the serious slr user will ever require. excellent lcd screen.if you're upgrading from a previous autofocus nikon, existing lenses are interchangeable.
easy to use,controls easy at hand,feels good in the hand.
great features, a good camera for serious amateurs.
instant response and gets it right every time.
image quality
it can be used to produce good photos whether it is used automatically, but also cna be used creatively on manual
excellent image quality
simple to use and professional results with an ability to customise the camera to suit exactly your own style.  this camera performs at the highest level whatever the subject matter.
very cheap when bought with camera as i have done but excellent quality for everyday pictures
easy handling, intuitive menu, good build, great images (particularly with nikon's vr lens technology)
upgraded from a d70 and still just love the nikon cameras and their ease of use.
size of screen/ ease of use

quality of pics is first class. well up to nikon standard.
plenty of features and excellent results, combined with ease of use make this a great camera for those wishing to progress further with digital photography.
everything
easy access to facilities.  good metering and a very good lens.
easy to use by a novice and a handy second hand camera for a dslr user. lots of manual control facilities for a pro user. bright, accurate and large display - have not needed a view finder yet.
love it! better than i was expecting. it takes a while to get use to the way it works but am really enjoying it and have no regrets of buying it.  have recommended it to friends
an excellent camera for those considering a compact camera to compliment their slr, or someone wanting to experiment with more creative shooting modes (manual, aperture priority etc).
this is simply the best compact i have owned. i bought this as a companion to my dslr and for shooting when i don't want to carry a lot of equipment.
a digital camera with a high specification. it is small and compact so can replace a dslr when it is not convenient to carry a heavy and larger camera. it produces pictures equaly as good  as a dslr of similar specification and will even take raw pictures which is certainly a plus for the experienced amateur. although there is no view finder this is no disadvantage except in very strong sunlight. however the ldc screen is quite bright and works quite well in framing a shot. the zoom range is limited but easily controlled with the large ring around the lens.
great camera. for a small compact it takes fantastic quality pictures. really, there is little you can't love about this camera.
good size
i like it very much... because it is light compare to g11/g10. it captures nice images..(it is good it focusing/sharp images) if you want a light camera ... this is for you.
it also means i can now carry a camera everywhere i go.
compact, good manual settings, good photos.
fantastic camera, even better than expected.  bought to replace a powershot s60 and very impressed by how much better it is - very compact, big screen, no red eye ever, great night time pics, vastly improved battery life etc.  strongly recommend.
low light performance, size, raw, image quality for compact.
everything
very good performance under low light conditions
image quality is good bearing in mind this is a compact camera.  it is very compact and easily carried in a shirt pocket.  battery life is good.  low light level image quality is good , iso 800 pictures are quite acceptable.  makes a good second camera to partner a dslr.
good quality pics. worth its value.
has a wide range of shooting styles and produces great photos.
love the massive zoom on this product, i now have massive picture of my work colleagues ear. it is easy to use, but still have enough override features.
it's easy enough to use and there's no faffing about with buttons if you don't want the flash on.  you just don't flip it up!
large, clear lcd, excellent optical zoom for price bracket, compact
easy to use and operate. comfortable to hold. excellent zoom.
easy to use and light and flexible .feels comfortable.good all round camera.
very impressed with the results, especially with using the manual setting.
good zoom range, bright screen, aa batteries, good value
has lots of advanced features for the price, e.g. full exposure and aperture control.  an amazing 10x optical zoom for a compact digital.
very easy to operate and comfortable to hold in the hands. i enjoy using it.
good quality, top spec, good price at time
superb,   just  need rechargeble  baterys   , and  charger
there is an idiot's setting and the screen is large
very good camera 'fits in your poket ready to uses straitaway ,takes exelent photos
very good product with many features. it is great value
love the zoom feature---main reason for buyingt his and it's a canon
really good quality and easy to use.  we haven't learned a fraction, yet, of the camera's capabilities, but we are very impressed.  the camera is a really good bridge between an slr and compact.
excellent image quality and 10x zoom. loads of features including manual control.  small enough to fit in your bag and good size screen.  very good value for money compared to similar spec compacts.
uses aa batteries
everthing
was recommended this camera by 2 friends and i can understand why.superb imageing with a fantastic optical  zoom - as good as it gets.also have a eos400d but this is far better for every day  / holiday use
it was a graduation gift for my daughter and she loves it easy for her to use. she has been taking a lot of photos with it and will have to wait for feed back from her.
ease of use and quality of pictures
it does everything that the 50d does but has the video option which is fantastic. i didnt realise that you can also take a still photo whilst in video mode until i read the manual. the quick control screen is a major bonus over my old 350d. being able to change iso, image quality and metering in seconds really helps with my nature and bird photography. although the build quality is not the same as the 50d its lightness helps when carrying all my lenses with tripods when birding.
provides common (or difficult to find) options quickly. creative modes allow beginners to use it as well as more experienced users. excellent screen display and resolution. resdesigned grip is excellent. depth of field setting provides quite good results, but usually badly fails to include all captured focussing points when using flash.
the quality of image, high iso level in dark conditions and hd movie are the strengths of this product
very small and light comapred to my main 5d mark ii body, easy to use, favourites menu, built in flash.
it continues the build quality that i have learnt to expect from canon
ease of use,  fairly intuitive controls,  large high-def screen.  i bought this to replace an ageing eos300d which was brilliant,  except that with slightly failing eyesight the controls and indicators were getting a bit difficult to read.  the large display on the 500d  is a major improvement in that respect.
i can still use my original lenses from the 350d so it has saved me money.   it is very simple to use and the photographs are outstanding when viewed either on the computer or tv screen through the dvd player.
fantastic screen, good photo image quality
allows you to point and shoot with very little set up but also has the capability to let you select all settings manually. with the addition of full hd video makes it a very comprehensive and versatile camera for the price. also will take all ef/efs lenses
a great camera easy to use, i would recommend the eos 500 d to any one.
exellent and easy to use.
improved on previous model but retaining the ease of use and familiar menu.
a reasonably priced high spec camera.
compact, good quality images.
picture quality, ergonomics, ease of menunavigation, battery life, colour handling.
i have been using the 400d for 3 years, and have found that the upgrade to the 500d is currently good value. i wanted the extra quality of 14 bits rather than 12, and the extra few mega pixels. i also wanted to move to sd cards. live view and camcorder modes are not essential to me, but work pretty well and are a nice bonus. i also think that some of the menu options have been improved, and i like the addition of spot metering. i have played with the raw images in adobe camera raw, and the improved quality has so far not disappointed.
excellent sensor and viewing screen
produces excellent photo's and is not difficult to use.
previous camera was a 400d. best improvements for me are much better high iso (low light) image quality, better customisation features and better preview screen.
can use lenses from old 35mm eos camera; similar look and feel to old 35mm camera; good quality
additional features such as video (hd) introduced but a pity we have to use the screen instead of viewfinder
great iso preformance. really good camera for the pro amature.
easy to use, compatible with previous eos lenses, large file size makes croping for close up images possible.
large screen, video, build quality, simple programmes
as canon, and other makers, are bringing out new models at a rate of more than two a year, there is no need to go for the more professional camera for longivity as the build quality is good enough for the short life it will have.
lots of features. good image quality.
have not used all the features yet but very pleased with the images i have taken so far.
ease of use
great camera, size, functions and build quality. review screen is 1st class
easy to use, and with a lot of features, the image quality is excellent, and hd video mode is very useful.
general allround quality
no steep learning curve from 450d
takes very good pictures, allows plenty of control
very good camera for those wanting something more than the point and click. enjoyable to use and with a little experimentation you'll be pleasantly surprised at the resulting photos.
my 41 year old husband prefers the film cameras, seriously brill camera for all, expensive but you can't beat cannon.
great quality shots once the operator achieves the same standard as the kit.
good quality product
having previously purchased a 450d, the extra features of the 500d justified the purchase of  the 500 d body. the extra pixels, the extra range of iso and the option to use as a cam 'corder proved excellent value for money.  not only that but i could now keep my canon 17 - 40 mm lens on one body and my tamron 18 - 270 mm lens on the other body. allowing me the option of lens without the interchangable aspect.
15mp video
15mp images
know when to use macro without telling it
i  have already recommended it to 3 people, and 5 friends and relatives own ixus cameras all of which are very pleased.
compact, and has own special battery and charger so charges from mains and doesn't use up our other general rechargeable batteries.
a good, small, quality build camera which is compact and easy to carry in a shirt pocket if you need to.  good features for a compact camera and i would recommend it.
good value for money. bought it to replace a panasonic lumix fs10 that i lost - this camera was less money and performs better. overall happy with the results.
its a very good buy for somebody that needs an everyday digital camera that doesnt cost a fortune. it takes quality pictures day and night (brightest sunshine and nightclubs) even on auto, saving the hassle of messing around with the iso. the images dont come out blurry (and im an amateur) and are best when the flash is on (even during the day). close up images (flowers, any people that try semi-professional nice pictures from an angle or just focusing the front bit of the image) are absolutely amazing. the wide lense is a lovely feature, even i wasnt expecting to make such a nice difference. would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera for everyday/holiday use, im sure its nothing you will regret!
for price, this camera offers an excellent alternative to more expensive brands which do basically the same thing. it's small, compact and versatile with good image quality. feature menus are well set out making quick adjustments to your image easy.
am now thinking about buying myself one
compact solid build quality, comfortable to hold in use, good battery life. good instructions.
not being a very technical person i find this camera very easy to use.. also the picture quality and focusing are brilliant
nice camera,but yor email says that there was a free case with this camera will i never recieved one with my camera
i've used canon cameras for years and find the functions easy to use
great small and easy to use
good quality camera with amazing price
easy to use, compact size and weight
i like the look and feel of the camera
compact, good quality pictures and video. great value for money.
compact.
very small, slim, compact camera. takes very clear photos. very simple to use.
very compact,battery life excellent.
easy to use
haven't thoroughly explored all the features yet but from what i have seen so far, it handles colours well, takes clear pictures and uses light well. i don't have a problem with it so far.o
easy to use and very light and compact to carry around. fits into your pockets.
fits easily into handbag
clear pictures
good value for money easy to use
its compact its a good clear screen and easy to use.
a highly versatile camera, with many of the same features available on the 'higher end' 7d semi-pro model. i was planning on purchasing the 7d, but having felt the sheer weight of this camera and compared the spec with that of the 550d, only the shooting speed and minor differences in sensor processing seem different to me. the lighter body of the 550d, and much lighter price, swayed me. whilst the top dial presets suggest it is marketed as a 'beginner' dslr, there is plenty for the more serious amateur to get to grips with. indeed, the fact that i haven't really captured the quality of photo i was hoping for as yet suggests that 'tweaking' is an important skill to get the best from it.
great camera, very pleased!!!
solid, well designed camera with the feel of a great film camera.  great viewfinder.  really like the sensor that makes the rear viewfinder picture image disappear when you put the camera to your face. quality of the lens and the images are extraordinary.   loads and loads of clever features which will take me months to work through.  i was an avid film eos user, and am really pleased so far with this new digital version.
the canon ef-s 18-135 lens is a reasonable good all rounder, especially when on holiday.
battery life is also excellent.
having previously purchased the canon 300d and 400d cameras, i had no reservation in purchasing the 550d as an upgrade. the camera produces outstanding performance with ultra crisp sharpness. i was very surprised at the quality of the images from 6400asa setting which corresponded to that from the 800asa setting on the 400d. all the features are ergonomically laid out for ease of operation and no twitching fingers which could unintentionally change the asa setting as on the 400d.
the camera is very fast to operate in manual mode with nice clear menus and display. although i found i use it most in aperture priority mode.  the bundled 18-55mm lens is better than expected too.  i bought it with this lens as i can't afford the lens i really want yet and thought this would get me started. i was very impressed with it.
the performance across the range is at the point where the most important/limiting thing that effects the photographs that you take is the lens not the camera itself -- save on the body by buying the 550d and put the money towards 'l' series lenses!
the video quality is great although it can be a bit tricky at times.
manufacturing methods. after over five decades of serious commitment to the chemical process and to low tech, high build quality, equipment, i took some winning over to the value of the digital process. the 550d is not just a high tech lump of plastic, as i would so often regard such kit, but has the potential for serious image production. once i accepted that it is not a lieca, a hassle, or a broni, i was able to settle down to some serious photography.
would definitely recommend this camera to anyone thinking about buying one, do it, you will not be sorry.
it us a good size in the hand, the never ending pusuit of making things smaller is ok but it can go too far and things become fiddly to use but not this camera.
in the hands. being able to increase the iso rating enabled me to take some good pictures inside a church without using the flash, which is also very handy. the results from the camera are very pleasing, the auto focus and range of metering options are excellent.
so versatile. a good mid-range camera with excellent still and movie capabilities. compares very well with the direct competition.
it's perfect! the quality of video is amazing! and the camera itself is quite light!
having used a hybrid dslr / compact style camera for the last 3 years (panasonic dmc-fz18) i needed to upgrade to a better more professional style dslr camera, and this fits the bill perfectly.  it has great ability to control every aspect of each shot to the finest of changes in exposure, dof, focus, flash adjustments which makes taking photos a lot more fun as the result can be viewed using the dof preview button before you click.  i have not used the on-screen preview as i prefer using the eye-piece.  this camera has taken my photography skills and results to a higher level.
stunning camera for the money. i don't buy anything without looking around for the absolute biggest bang for the buck. just buy this camera. honestly.
now on my third canon dslr having previously owned the 300d and 350d. the 550d is nothing short of superb. was going to buy when it first came out but decided to soldier on with the excellent 350d and wait for the price to reduce. when it did, i bought it and have been more than impressed, especially in low light conditions.
an awesome entry-level dslr with a great kit lens.  the body and lens is of a good build quality.  the menu system is simple, with many beginner and more advanced features.  the lcd is large, bright and crystal clear.
if you have had a canon before it's like meeting an old friend who has had a makeover. very easy to use, clear menus, lovely to hold.
quality feel-lightweight yet sturdy a host of special features some yet to be tried. the image quality on large screen is amazingly good.
i'm a complete amatuer but have taken some cracking shots. still know almost nowt about the camera and how to use properly, but delighted with the results so far.
it does what it says on the tin and does it well. i haven't had the opportunity to explore all the features and i am sure there are many i will never fully use. the image quality is great which was one of the main deciding factors for choosing it.
the 550d has quality written all over it, would recommend a flash gun though, image quality is superb in particular using raw setting.
image quality is superb and obviously the image stabiliser in the lens helps to shoot at lowere shutter speeds than ever before. other than the comment below i cannot fault this camera.
image quality is on par with the canon 7d, hd video is great.  typical canon menu system, works well.  quite a light camera, so maybe a battery pack would give better balance for some.  doesnt have the build quality and weight of the 7d and comparible camera - but then it costs a huge amount less.  somewhat smaller than 7d and similar too, but this isnt necessarily a bad thing.  all in all brilliant cam for the money, punches well above its weight, iso noise control is astounding.
- the most modern construction on the market
use didnt come with memory card which would have been better so you can start to use straight away very good battery life
canon 550d is a very good camera for budding photo ensuastic like me. it produce a good quality image, and with a small hand i can handle it features with such an ease. and it also produce a good video. i intend to use the camera for photos only but sometimes you really can capture precious moment with a great video which is very handy with this model. price-wise, i think i got myself a bargain.
the screen menu and buttons are easy to use/ navigate for an amaetuer like myself and the jog dial is excellent. produces very good quality images.
how long do you have? there are so many - too many to mention... okay, how about the self timer shot.  not one, but you can take multiple shots in the same sitting giving you the option to pick a great image instead of having to retake.  loved this feature.  the screen, live view, video - yes video and it's fab.  hd recording... sd card expanson.  superb build quality coupled with a nice cannon lens.  you'll soon be wanting to upgrade the lens if you're into amateur wildlife or photography that needs a photo zoom, such as planespotting  - while i am mainly using this camera for.
brilliant camera - meant as a second body to take my other lens but has become my main
a pleasure to use light and compact
results are excellent. it was bought to supplement previous eos digital models and it hasn't disappointed.
excellent quality pictures, brilliant iso control for low light environments. easy to use, if you want a starter slr thats fun and easy to use this one is worth the money!
an excellent camera, well made, great features. basically the same technically as the 600d but without the movable lcd display. overall a great camera!
the 550d is amazing! the image quality is awesome and the video quality is outstanding!
everything!! the image quality is excellent and the camera is easy to use. for the price these are going for now they are a bargain and others don't come close.
fantastic camera, easy to use and amazing quality of the pictures..love it,
i'm thrilled this camera is wonderful
superb image quality and handling. excellent features that compensate for the high price.
brilliant pictures and such a pleasure to use with so many very usefull features as for instance vairable shutter speeds at the turn of the dial and such sharp pictures.
very easy to use, takes excellant photographs. the movie option is extremly good especially taking air craft like the red arrows.great being able to shoot through the lcd.
great camera for a novice photographer like me.  i've got some great holiday snaps with it.  it's quick to use if you just want to take a quick snap.  i've also got some nice long exposure photos of the night sky.  fab.
camera has ability to take stunning photographs - even with supplied 'cheap' lens. video abilities are incredible. shooting hd video at 24fps creates incredible film like imagery that is clearly broadcast quality. don't worry about the inability to auto focus as normal camcorders do - because it is really easy to manually focus using liveview
range of features
it's almost impossible to take a poor quality photograph when set to 'idiot' mode (full auto) for more serious photographers it has all the functions of pricier cameras and the sheer 'wow' factor from those who see your photos.
really great size, and a dream to use. really well equipped camera for the money, and gives outstanding images.
a wise choice for those amateurs who want to upgrade their gear:stunning pictures,decent features,very good build quality
just love it
bought after fairly extensive research but opted for this over nikon 3100 / 5100 and eos1100d (poor build quality). whilst the eos600d was also available this was much more expensive for little gain (flexible lcd screen). overall very satisfied with 5550d. easy to use, great picture quality and lots of manual options to explore.
new metering mode gives really good white balance, compare to my old dslr. high iso, which makes picture fully usable/printable even with slow shutter speed. gotta say, the kit lens really surprised me. i was expecting it to be completely useless, but it's quite good. what about movie mode, it shoots 1080p videos 24/25/30 fps - what else you need?! the best thing about 550d is it's price.
software appears to be good
simple to use.
good camera with plenty of features. a camera for beginers to experienced users.
my first slrcamera proven to be very exciting the quality of picture fab
despite being predominantly plastic, it's very good, solid plastic solidly constructed.  it is very simple to get going if you want to just point and shoot on full auto, conversly it has a mass of featues to be creative when you want to be and have had the time to learn how to use such features.  the video function (hd) is excellent and the 300 or so photos i've tken so far have been of a really good quality.
very easy to use, even for a beginner like me. perfect quality pictures and videos even in low light.
great quality, hd video shoots at a great high pixel rate.
large screen on back a delight.
overall satisfied.
best entry level dslr currently available.
digic 4 processor is amazing, it delivers minimum noise even at high iso ratings.
great price for a widely highly-rated camera. fabulous image quality, great features for a newbie to the slr world.
brought this for the 18 meg pixel, top quality, has all the features of the 600, except the the swivel viewfinder. no complaints as yet, great variety in auto focus and endless other features
brilliant camera! am still getting to grips with all the settings. think it will take a while, but that is not a bad thing, as my photography skills can develop with this camera. considering i am a beginner, i have been able to take some beautiful photos already. can't wait to use it when on holiday in iceland.
first dslr having used a canon eos film camera some years ago.  the image stabilisation is superb, even on relatively short focal lengths, so much so that my old canon lenses seem poor in comparison.  so much more usable than my compact digital
wonderful crystal clear photos with endless creative potential
very easy to use without reading the entire manual. it feels a very solid camera and the picture quality is really good.
fantastic for film and photography, the video quality is full hd which is great for its price and the lens makes everything much better.
havnt really had the camera long enough to find all its +s and -s, but initially, more than pleased
this is a high quality and very flexible piece of equipment. i am no great expert but found that what it claims to do it does.
build quality, comfortable handling, still very useable even for a novice!
i like everything about this camera .the video clips i take with this camera looks great even in normal indoor lighting.                 overall its a great camera
i looked carefully at buying an eos 50 but on evaluating the 550 i realised that as an amateur, the spec was better on the 550. money wasn't an issue, but i think i saved loads of money and got a great product.
simple enough to pick up and shoot straight away but has enough features to keep even an experienced photographer busy!
easy to use, excellent image quality for both still and hd video.  camera is quick to start up and responsive during use.
what a piece off kit. everything for the amateur to an expierenced photographer. will have years off use.
i am very happy with my purchase
lightweight, all usual canon functions
easy to use once you've read the manual and practised! beautifully built, it falls to hand very easily and has a good weight about it without being too heavy. i would recommend buying the battery grip as this adds to it's ease of use. excellent piece of kit.
fantastic camera- great value.  easy to pick up and shoot but with plenty of options for the seasoned pro :)
just love it
more or less point and shoot....with loads of possibilities available for further exploration!
we bought this to take pictures of our family etc.i must say best investment yet! my wife has never used an slr before and says it so easy use on auto and the semi auto setting, she has even managed to achieve great images as if she was taking on manual setting
great picture quality, great screen size, nice to handle and controls easy to use
to many to mention
easy to use for the beginner - plenty of features for the amature-professional.
this is easy to review. a superb piece of kit as the saying goes. i love it.
a great piece of kit. good functions and features. matched with excellent results. brilliant!!
i love the combination of the eos 550d with the 18 - 135mm lens.  this is fine for most situations, an avoids the need for too many lens changes.  (the image quality is good enough to do any further zooming later digitally)
this is my first dslr and i found it to be very easy to use, and the image quality is brilliant (it's like a breath of fresh air compared to my old camera)!
easy to use and takes sharp detailed pictures.
it is very simple use, very self explanitary
having used point and shoot cameras for a while following the demise of my minolta slr this is simply fabulous. easy to use
this camera has just about every feature you can get - well pleased
everything 10/10.
its a lovely camera, the picture quality is brilliant. its light weight and easy to hold on to.
great features particularly for video capture.
quick and responsive.
highly recommended!
easy to use, battery life is very good
excellent camera for astrophotography, with low noise even in long exposures
book to assist me with the use of this camera (ie which settings work best in which lighting/environment) however overall i cannot praise this camera enough.
set up properely you can get sharp images with good exposure. i am just an amateur but i getting good results with this camera
started using straight away, easy to use, looks good quality.
easy to use and fantastic image quality.
very light and the picture quality is superb.
once you have gotten around the features and settings  i found it easy to use and i am looking forward to experimenting in manual focus
many customisation possibilities with image settings
the camera is fantastic - decent value for money and some nice new bits of technology that make it really worthwhile especially if you set it up with some good glass.
very easy to use giving good quality results
its a very good camera great when you get used to it,it do'es what you want and quickly
very high picture quality and easy to use shooting modes and manual camera featres.

the camera is quite easy to use, and also not too heavy to carry around.
everything!
a lot of features, good step up from earlier models.
very easy and intuative for a point and shoot/keen amateur user. i love the image quality and my partner loves the noise it makes on continuous shoot!
lightweight, good build quality, good photos and video, included kit lens are very light and the image quality is acceptable, the only extra required to start taking pictures is a sd card
i had my 1000d stolen and up graded to 550d. the picture quality is so much bettet. i'm very new to cameras and not used all the features yet. the 18-135 lens is the best thing ever.
it's an excellent camera, does everything i want and more
far exceeds expectations
very easy to use
money well spent
for a amateur photographer its got everything you want. we are still getting used to it.
aperture speed is great .. excellent battery life... great quality camera

its just a great camera what more can i say
excellent for beginners and experimenters alike (although i need to learn more before i try this).
what can i say, it's my first slr camera and it's as good as i expected, i suppose for what i paid it should be top quality pictures, quite easy to use  not to heavy but most of all image qualty is stunning, 1080hp video mode is fantastic

excellent image quality and features.
first time to own a dslr, fantastic, good value, good quality picture, very happy.
awesome quality images
- well built.
really super, fairly compact camera -can't go wrong with the automatic setting, so you get great quality pictures immediately while you learn how to use the other functions properly
this is my first dslr and it's a great camera, easy to use, build quality as expected of a canon product.
really good mid-range canon dslr, fairly easy to use and change settings. you can get some cracking images once you get used to customising and working in the various modes.
comprehensive instruction manual.
its a cannon. quality product pleasure to use.image quality need i say more.
it just feels nice, loads of tips and lessons on youtube for 550d, so you pick up what to do very quick, if this is your first digital slr
easy to use for the beginner but plenty to learn!
ease of use
pr\xe9cision des clich\xe9s pris en mode  automatique.
fantastic image quality
excellent product really love and enjoying it
very pleased with this purchase.
first camera of this type for me, simple to use easy guide big wow factor
lens does the job
very good for starters and good options for photography learners
excellent camera, easy to use and superb picture quality
brilliant beginner entry level camera, build quality is sturdy and feels great.
it is far easy then most cams for showing you all whats on offer on the top of the cam, its not heavy and its made really well and isnt too big.
picture quality at all levels
the camera is also lightweight and relatively compact.
excellent brand (of course). being a total beginner i find the many auto settings invaluable. of course as experience is gained the many personalised settings can then be utilised. this means great photos can be taken almost immediately, without having to wade through a comprehensive instruction manual.
user friendly, with a vast array of features that you would find on a more expensive mid entry camera. video mode is exceptional with the ability to create quite stunning broadcast quality creations
great little camera
very easy to use and i am a beginner. currently on a short course to learn how to use it better!
everything, can be used as point and shoot or for some really creative pics
very easy to use, some good features for an entry level dslr, it feels to have a good build quality, very good image quality, manual settings are very easy to use. very good value camera and if you are moving from a bridge or a better point and shoot you won't be disappointed.
accessories easy to find
feels good to use - as a totally amateur user i could pick it up, set it to auto and take some really good looking pics.
has a ca screen where you can easily get to a variety of changes in one screen in cases where you need to take different photos quickly.
as an amateur, this camera is very easy to use and photographs look very professional. swapping between manual and auto is very simple
find it easy to use in all functions
really good camera - so easy to use and understand.  felt like a professional using it.
lots of ato selections for beginers
simple to take nice enough photographs, good kit lens
i loved the picture quality
very easy to use.  just set to basic mode (autofocus, automatic), focus and shoot.
nice grip, excellent image quality. loads of features.
i love dis camera
excellent camera, easy to use and gives professional pictures.
great bundle.  the 550 d is much better value than 600 which has only marginally better features.  the ef-s 18 -135 lense  is great walk about lense
love the manual focusing as very quick!
bought this for my trip to the states and have no regret took over 2000 pictures. once you use an slr all other cameras seem useless
tr\xe8s bon objectif, qualit\xe9 de photo vraiment extra
the camera is great, very happy!
very good starter slr camera recommended to beginners.
best camera bought do far ;). would recommend buying this camera to anyone. this is my first dslr so can't compare to others but so far so good. n
an excellent camara which is easy to use and is well balanced,
ease of use, handling and picture quality
the camera is excellent alrounder
overall an excellent camera. feels more substantial in your hands than a 600d. excellent screen. well laid out menu controls.the camera will easily take more than 400 pictures in raw format on a single battery. the 17-85mm kit lense is ok and seems sharpest around 50 mm.
it is an excellent camera for the serious hobbyist - the camera feels solidly built, picture quality is very good even under some difficult cinditions, the burst speed for sports shots is impressive!
a very good camera with a nice feel about it, easy to use and good instruction book
i am used to using a full pro body( nikon d2xs and nikon d3) but i didn't need these any more and made the move to this canon!! not something i am regretting! great camera!
series lens on it.  flip screen has it uses when you need to hold the camera up high to get a shot.  camera can turn raw into jpegs and can fire most canon flashes remotely.
although its a higher level dslr than the entry level cameras it doesnt confuse the amateur user but enables you to learn more complex features and produce better pictures.
great images. easy to use. i can still use my older canon lenses which saved me a lot of money.
it's my first dslr and i love it. everything is fantastic, right down to battery life.
has the point and shoot starter option(where i am now) through to almost professional programming mode (where i want to be)
great choice of lens
easy to using and not too heavy,is good for women use too.
good lens and build quality is very good, like the reversible screen. picture quality is excellent too.
quality
love it, used to have an slr years ago
the large number of facilities and options, including: spirit level, folding lcd screen, multiple images with different exposure settings at the press of a button.
easy to use
controls are very intuitive, easy to use and nicely positioned on the body for making quick adjustments during shooting. the recording / filming features are excellent and the flip screen is really useful for out of reach shots.the quality of both the photos and films are top notch.
excellent feel, build quality, looks, features, i love this camera.

easy to use. video quality is excellent.standard lens is grand.
the camera is has a lot of features that you wouldn't normally get with a camera of this price, it also feels very rugged and well built.
great features, upgraded from the canon 100d and would definitely recommend this product.
fast shutter speeds, ideal for wildlife and sports. sensor cleaner. good build. quick to switch from video to stills and vice versa
veiw screen a great feature  - usual canon quality
surprisingly light weight, first time dsrl user and very impressed
really recommend it!!
excellent sharpness of images even at magnification.
this model is excellant for the crossover from slr to digital, features are endless which can be found in the dearer models. the ease of picture taking is exceptional, and limitless.a great starter dslr highly reccomended.
just a great product
top of camera controls easier to use than my previous model (eos 30d)
great features and image quality, the camera just feels well built.
veryttelyt easy to use.
every feature you could wish for at your finger tips. great product support from canon.
lovely camera .. great model to start learning more about slr and photography ... combines manual and automatic features beautifully.
easy to use, compatible with my lenses from old eos 450d
feels sturdy, very easy to use even for an amatuer. amazing picture quality. great camera, great value for money. highly recommended model.
easy to learn. good lenses available. easy to hold b
no  doubt about the product which is good i have been using it from last four months
i have achieved good audio by attaching a zoom h2n via its headphone socket to the 3.5mm mic socket on the camera. by fiddling with the camera's manual gain, and the zoom h2n's headphone volume, i was able to match the audio meter on the zoom with that on the camera. this way i can still monitor audio levels while shooting video (using the zoom), even though the camera won't let you see its audio meter while shooting.
good balence and body shape. higher quality at higher iso values allowing for faster shutter speeds in low light. 18-55mm lens has been improved and has a more solid feel which is better on manual focus setting.
good image and video quality. good build quality too for the money.
for the price and features it excels against any rivals in the same range
i purchesed the cannon sx210 is to provide an alternative to my slr and it does that with style. it's compact size gives easy yet professional performance. it is fun to use because the range of features offers the opportunity to shoot in all conditions without having to spend valuable time 'setting up'. offering the settings choice of 'easy shot' and 'auto' as well as manual really does give this camera a powerfull edge. i love it's descreate size which makes you feel comfortable in crowded places. it's just packed with user friendlineness and photographic features all at a very competative price.
oh yes - 720p video what more can you want.  my sony hd camcorder is getting worried now!!
the 14x is fantastic. fantastic picture quality. my son doesn't sit still for 10seconds so getting a pictureof him that isn't blurred is a struggle - my nikon coolpix  was never up to the job (or maybe my photography skills weren't) but this canon is just perfect on auto and there's just never a blur. the red-eye reduction feature works a treat - it's not the double flash, it actually has a feature that finds red-eye after the photo is taken and removes it for you in the photo. i'm still getting used to all the features (eg panoramic stitching) so having it work well on auto is a relief. there's lots of comments on here about the positioning of the flash but you get used to it, and if you have your finger holding it  down by mistake you can easily flick the flash back up manually - not an issue at all.
can be used in manual or automatic.
simple point and shoot with a degree of flexibility for creativity. fantastic zoom yet still retaining adequate quality at max zoom. bought as a back up to my dslr's but seems to be supplanting them.
its extremely easy to use, all functions are easy to follow, its just so easy to get to know your camera, it has a few extra functions that my xs200 dos'nt have  which makes going from framed pictures to moving pictures without having to change.
point and shoot! good image quality.
i love it!
just slips into your pocket so you can take it anywhere........surprising performance and easy to use
superb pictures.  the people at canon really made this to be a great camera.
the image quality is fantastic! the pictures take every little detail of the object you are taking a photo of. even when you use the video part of the camera, it still keeps the same high level of quality. the zoom is absolutely fantastic as well! could not believe that i could still take such a sharp picture of an object so far in the distance. also, i love the feature that automatically takes a picture of you when you smile! absolutely fab.
very good value for money.
this is an easy to use camera which gives good results in even quite poor light.  excellent focusing system.
just about all of it. i love that it turns on and it ready to take pictures really quickly. you do have to take time to learn it, but that is not a bad thing as there are so many features. however, it functions really well as a point and shoot too so you really get the best of all worlds. also, i have had mine for a while, taken loads of photos and videos, done loads of playback and still on the first charge of the battery. all good!
great as a day to day camera for concerts etc
it is very easy to use and has so many features that make it seem like a 'big' camera but this fits easily in a handbag or pocket.  i love it the more i use it.
solid built canon product with easy use, excellent features as per other canon cameras. i also own and use two canon non digital slrs
amazing zoom quality and  many features that make taking great photos easy.
image quality and close focusing,i do a lot of flower studies and this camera is ideal for this. ease of carrying, i am used to the weight of an slr canon, 450d, so this new toy is far more convenient, and less heavy, in use.
compact, loads of features (still yet to find them all), very easy to use and great zoom!
exelent manual functions which are very easy to navigate. i like that when you change the settings manually, that you can see the adjustment as you look through the screen. the camera does not have a view finder so you use the display screen as a view finder which is great as it gives you more freedom when taking photos. it is a nice size camera and feels sturdy, the image quality is excellent aswell as having excellent quality video. i have to say im a happy snapper with this one :)
durable and attractive with many excellent features. love the way when you view images the screen changes from landscape and portrait.
i am a novice at taking photos, but even my photos look good. the picture quality is fantastic and i and playing around with it rying different things and enjoying myself
various lenses.
easy to get started, zoom does what it says, pictures are good.
amamzing photo
surprisingly powerful optical zoom.  overall picture quality very good with natural colours.  contrary to some reviewers, i rather like the pop-up flash as you can be sure it won't flash by mistake if the unit is not allowed to pop up.
has the feel of a quality product as soon as you pick it up, but compact enough to carry around in your pocket. it has masses of features, which i am still learning about, but it is as easy or as complicated as you want it to be. it has an automatic setting if you just want to point and shoot, or it has all the manual settings for light, shutter speed etc. plus it has various integral colour filters. great value little camera.
white function but hey, you can't have it all.  it's sometimes too quick for me, so it takes abit of getting used to if you're an amateur like me.  well worth it though.
would def recommend it!
there are no gimmicks....it is easy to use. i bought this product as a gift,so the package with the extra battery was extremely useful. also to add to this package, i want to purchase an underwater housing as the recipient wants to use when diving.
excellent everyday camera with a bit more control when you want it
unlike the previous sx200, the flash can fold away when not in use.
amazing image stabilisation at full telephoto. colour and light/dark balance great. everything i expected from a canon camera.
excellent picture quality. good in lowlight conditions.
different features, inc. minituare mode, fisheye lens. easy to use with good quality pictures.
the hd video quality is really good u can zoom right in as far as it will go and you don't loose any of the quality.
provides detail on screen for the different shooting modes so you don't need to keep referring to the manual. well worth using these to get the advantage of the setting in differing conditions.
brilliant zoom, fits in my handbag, full manual capability
compact camera.  wideangle view.  reasonably easy to use.  good battery and recharger, especially as included with the product.
bought it for my mum - she is not very good with cameras. but this one was easy to use, with good quality pictures and video - everything she needed. plus, the screen is bright and big!
movie.  so far only used on auto setting but extremely pleased with results.
excellent zoom, very stylish, quick to take photos, lots of different modes and features (tv mode is very handy)
slim enough for handbag, lightweight for holidays, nights out, easy to use
excellent zoom.  easy to use takes an excellent picture
after all photo cameras i had in the past, it is the best one ever! it's a good size camera, with big zooming program, captures every detail. even it's takes the picture itself if you smiling. the life of the battery is quite good. but i bought an extra one in any case. there is so many good things about this camera. you have to try it. i recommend to everyone who enjoying amateur and home photography.
easy to use so anyone can get great photos with it, but also has feature that may come in handy for the more experienced photographer and anyone looking to better there photos.
easy to use
easy to use, great size, fantastic image quality
very impressive features and size for a 14x zoom camera. ideal if you want to go out without too much stuff, just put it your pocket! with a camera this good, you don't need a dslr unless you're a pro really. i'm still finding features i didn't realise it had.
very easy to use, i had to play with it a lot to get the feel of it ,in all very good !
it is not the smallest compact camera, but i didn't expect it to be small wih a 14x optical lens and large screen.
all the features of an slr. great image quality and zoom + excellent additional features such a fish eye lens. in screen instructions to help with usage.
the image quality is fantastic. you can really notice the difference in mega pixels. great digital zoom as well
zoom and picture quality.
a wonderful camera, easy to use and great reproduction.
amazing zoom and excellent photo quality, even in poor light.
focussing is better than the nikon coolpix p100 26x which i have.  fits in the pocket too.  i like the manual focus which enlarges part of the screen
good quality images for a compact camera. once you get the settings right you can happily use it on full auto, semi auto or manual. built in flash is suitable for most uses. lens goes from fairly wide to super zoom (~28mm-400mm in 35mm terms). overall this is a suitable replacement for my dslr when a slr is too big to carry.
excellent value for money - lots of nice features
excellent quality of photo
easy to use, good functionality. takes amazing photos on manual setting as long as you know how to use it.
i found the camera very easy to use just needed to focus and click, all information came up on the screen so did not need to keep looking at the booklet.
a versatile camera, which is very easy to use.
my 'main' camera is a pentax k-m dslr, but i often find it too bulky to lug about, which is why i wanted a good quality compact to go with it. i was attracted to the sx210 is by the long lens and good reviews, so i took the plunge. i never use the 'auto iso' setting, as higher isos always have too much of a negative effect on picture quality. set to iso 80, the picture quality is so good in good light, that it is almost on a par with my pentax. considering the sensor on the pentax is around 13 times bigger than on the canon, this is a quite astonishing result and significantly better than any other compact with a similar size sensor that i have ever owned. i have always found the 'in camera special effects' to be a waste of time in the past, but several on the sx210 is are genuinely good and combined with that long telephoto lens, really makes we want to get out and find things to photograph in a way i haven't felt for a while now, which is great.
value for money.very light, zoomable and sleek model.excellent image quality.14 mega pixel and 14x optical, it is amazing model.
small enough to put in bag. good zoom. easy  auto use.f
zoom lens 14x and wide lens, easy to use menu.
it was bought as a present for our daughter - she loves the large screen and the fantastic zoom power
fantastic zoom
excellent zoom feature
i am absolutely smitten with my new camera and would reccommend it to enyone who is an amateur, but would like to learn and take good pictures.
very easy to use and excellent image quality. i am a fan of canon ixus but this powershot has been fantastic. i thought the flash would annoy me as it pops up but it has been fine.
very easy to use,very good features
image quality very good
all you need in a camera, simple to use, great picture
simple to set up and ready for immediate use, excellent zoom/focusing
well made,seems easy to setup
simple to use.   the automatic lens cover is a great feature as it means no separate cap to keep hold of.   the panorama featuere is also very easy to use and very effective.
the photographs taken on auto are fantastic. very few red eye photos and the quality of the prints from the camera is great. i havent had time to read any of the book so just put it to auto and point and shoot - took fantastic photos of our daughter's wedding. would thoroughly recommend it. i have always used canon ixus cameras and still have an ixus 915 which is a great wee camera and i was worried about this one being a lot bulkier. it is not a problem and the quality of the photos make any difference in size irrelevant.
zoom is the best feture
excellent features in a compact digital camera. the powerful 14x optical zoom is rivaless in this class of cameras. the disign is also very attractive. probably the best compact digital camera for this price range.
almost idiot proof.!!! flash on left corner not a problem. smart looking. information comes up on screen on back.pictures look great.
zoom
as good as a big slr
very compact for amount of features. extremely easy to use. well built and feels really sturdy.
excellent pictures as you expect from a cannon. clear and sharp. i particular like the fact you can change from auto setting to manual and that adds another dimension to the camera.
good zoom
good image quality, manual control (though i havent had the need to use much so far), great zoom. the flash is not really so much of a problem as people tend to pose in some of the reviews, you just get used to it...
size, weight, zoom, video. lots of features in a small package. li-on battery so i don't need to keep purchasing batteries. manual controls.
the battery could use for a long time
great zoom,nice and compact, lots of features, looks great. fantastic screen.
hi zoom and manual settings
long zoom
long zoom
love it. image quality is great and it's very easy to use.
very easy to use
excellant quality smal camera great for all types of use
just what i was looking for a camera that is portable and not too chunky but still including all features i would like from other cannon cameras.
simple to use
picture quality is excellent, build is solid, only used a few times so not fully tested
i bought a 8gb card and this will give me over 350 piccies before full - more than enough for all trips really. more likely to run out of battery power before running out of image capability.
easy to use, but also has lots of gadgets for those who are looking for a little more in a camera. the camera itself feels good quality and its appearence is good. the picture quality is excellent and i think its value for money.
fantastic capabilities
not much experience yet, but i like the big zoom and the small size to fit in one's pocket. and many features which i am looking forward to using. excellent price
point and shoot camera that adapts to it's current environment to take the best possible picture.
takes great quality pictures as soon as you press the button( no delay or lots of flashes)
good zoom facility and easy to use on auto.
quality. good solid build, nice feel.full manual but can revert to full auto.good battery life. nice resolution.
excellent image quality, 14 x optical zoom on a compact camera is just amazing, hd video quality is better than my hd camcorder
quality of images and zoom
easy to use zoom is great
great and stills. fantastic zoom in such a compact body. very good value for money.
price
not had chance to use much up to yet but seems fab so far! images are good quality and is loads better than my last camera the sony t77!!
great pictures
very good focus. still a bit slow responding at times.
excellent zoom, easy to use outstanding
compact pocket size
excellent functionality, great quality pics and movie facility great too.
loads of different functions, and lots of manual options for the more experienced photographer.
small with big features
canon quality and ease of use
it is easy to use and takes a good image
the functions, the lcd screen quality is great. picture quality are great.
auto multifocal points
easy to use and easy to understand. great picture quality.
excellent picture quality
easy to use... good product with fair price..
great camera for point and shooting, has the ability to do more if neededn i bought this mainly for the price and i like metal casings.
-looks professional
- pretty
so many features, the image quality is fantastic and it is definitely worth my money. i was a little hesitant that the camera itself looks like a disposable but i've eventually fallen in love with it. a definite great buy!
easy to point and shoot from the beginners instructions which were only a couple of pages long
a nice camera
brilliant image quality, special effects are amazing and a really good all round camera, on par with an slr
small and compact, but still great pictures which is what a camera is all about. a***

great camera - especially for the price
nice looking. neat and easy to handel.
capture is very nice.
cheap at price. zoom good for both telephoto and wide angle.
i really like the fact that it is automatically focusing on faces or main features (smart auto) in the frame as you are sorting out the snap you want to take.
amazing depth in the photo's - feel like you could walk into them - for the price this is a truly magnificent piece of kit.  video not bad either
small compact and large screen

slim and easy to carry in a small handbag
the size of the screen - excellent
with the camera sorting out the settings for itself, and you can control what the camera does if you want to.  the camera is compact and seems well built.  overall it is an excellent package.
viewfinder - 2.7 inch lcd screen - general handling i.e. easy to get a good grip; the raised area on the front is ideally shaped for you to lock your index finger on.   this also acts as an anchor and helps keep the camera steady.
the picture quality is good too.
easy to use and user friendly
i bought this as a handy compact camera that would supplement my more expensive, and larger, cameras. as it is, i believe, the only compact camera with an optical viewfinder in current production, this was the only choice i had. being of a certain age, i find using cameras with only a display screen a great nuisance. get reading glasses out every time you want to take a picture is hopeless. the canon is light, simple to use and produces acceptable results.
really is a point-and-shoot camera in easy mode.  macro pics are well-focussed and look really professional. liked the structure of user manual i.e. the basic easy stuff in a small instruction book, plus the more complicated info. on disc.  that way you don't have to search through reams of text for the answer to a simple query.
lots of good features and found it easy to use. images like all canons are top notch.
excellent quality pictures from uch a cheap camera. has a usable view finder when needed. very easy to use menu system. uses standard aa or aa rechargeable batteries. video quality is outstanding.
nice compact camera with the advantage of having a view finder for looking through as well as the screen. this is very convenient when the sun is shining brightly and makes it very difficult to actually see anything on the screen.
bought for my wife who just loves it.
4) great price
having used a compact with only a screen which was useless in bright light, i looked for one with a viewfinder. this one does not dissapoint. although quite small, the viewfinder is all that's necessary, so much so that i only use it instead of the screen.   the main purpose of having a canera is to take pictures and this one takes good ones. the sharpness and colour are as good as i have seen. the quality of movies puts some camcorders to shame. the movie capacity depends on the memory card. there are more features on the camera than i am likely to use, but the layout makes selection easy. the main control wheel is positioned so you are unlikely to move it accidentally while in your pocket (or handbag) the a1200 ticks most of the boxes for a compact. for me, the decider was the viewfinder.
very useful view finder, my elderly mother finds it alot easier to use as had trouble with traditional digital cameras.
the view finder is invaluable in very bright conditions and i like the use of aa batteries (which you can pick up almost anywhere in the world). good quality photos and very easy to use. excellent camera.
viewfinder invaluable for bright sunny conditions, (doesn't happen often in uk), but great for foreign holidays when i take 90% of my photos anyway.  have been a fan of canon for years and have several powershot slr's (still all in working order). love the date displays and versatility of a1200.  excellent.
viewfinder, nice design, simple layout, solid buttons and switches, takes aa batteries, brand name reputation.
fantastic point and shoot camera with excellent results
viewfinder incorporated. uses aa batteries.
the camera is quite rugged, simple to use and the great thing is it runs on ordinary aa batteries.
very easy to use in auto mode and has user modes when more creativity and control is desired.
compact and easy to handle.  viewfinder as well as screen is useful.
as a retired person the most important feature is the eye viewfinder.this is a very important feature for my peer group and since my acquistion a number of my friends have indicated an interest in purchasing this model solely because of htis feature.
it's very easy to use and takes care of all the technical stuff itself, just as i want it.  it's really nice to hold, and a brilliant camera at a great price.
very easy to use, ideal point and shoot camera.
realistic colours, nice picture quality, compact.
good little camera with a basic viewfinder - lots of functions a nd nice photos for the price - be realistic don't expect dslr photos : )
very pleased with the product
a nice easy to use pocket camera with a viewfinder, so the screen can be switched off to save the batteries (i use re-chargeables).  can usually get good results with program mode.  not as well made as some, but doesn't feel as though it will break with normal use.  battery life is quite good and it uses standard aa batteries.
lightweight, has a viewfinder for difficult light conditions, has good wide angle - better than older models
an excellent starter option, and a good cheap camera small enough to carry around at all times for pictures of opportunity ( the pictures are good enough, losing or wrecking it are only a small disaster).
the optical viewfinder is indspensable forshooting in bright sunshine, despite a good screen image.  the use of readily available aa batteries avoids the dependance on a power supply when traveling in remote areas.  both features, which i consider essential, are not offered by many manufacturers.
the camera is very easy to use, with quite a few interesting features (although i prefer to use the auto-setting). the viewfinder is also useful and i chose this camera partly because it's one of the few to use aa batteries.
the canon a1200 has an optical viewfinder which is very rare on a compact camera so is excellent in strong sunlight
this camera has a viewfinder, which most point-and-shoot digital cameras lack. it makes a world of difference to what can be done in bright sunlight, when the screen is virtually useless.
rotary dial for selection of mode, unlike the ixus 75 where the slide switch could be moved when inserting or reving from the carry case. theviewinder is a good feature, especially in that the optical zoom view is provided.
light and very compact so easy to slip into a pocket or handbag. takes very good pictures and downloads quickly.
it has a view finder, which is a boon to anyone having to wear glasses, who wants to take a quick snap.
an excellent camera that produces the goods. is pocketable and above all it has a viewfinder --top marks to canon and it is excellent value for the money.a great little back up camera.
programs
it has a viewfinder which is invaluble in bright sunny weather. fits easily in ones pocket. needed something handy to just point and shoot without having to take a camera bag with me everytime.
very easy to use.
cracking little camera that has exactly what i wanted.  it has a simple setting which guides you through how to use it as you learn all about the new toy.  not too costly, lovely picture quality.  i read that it had a cheap plastic bulky body - completely disagree, yes it's plastic but it's a good buy.  completely understand why it was a which top product.
brilliant little camera
viewfinder allows use in strong light and also with screen turned off to prolong battery life in remote location.
compact size
very easy to use and takes lovely pictures,its even quite good in low light,the viewfinder is a big plus. highly recommended
great features and flexibility; very good image quality for the price; has a viewfinder too (regard this as vital in some lighting conditions).
no 1 priority for me - has a viewfinder.  small, fits in a pocket/handbag.  takes good pictures in ideal conditions - light and preferably outdoors.  aa batteries so easy to carry spares and don't need power source to recharge.  nice little camera for 'snaps' but a bit disappointing for anything more complex.  next camera with viewfinder is much more expensive and complicated.
nice compact camera wih good features. very good image quality. helpful to have the viewfinder but quite small. good fun playing around with the different settings i.e monochrome, fish eye lens etc. haven't used the video yet so can't comment on that aspect.
close to the 'ideal' digital point-and-shoot for most users. i use the camera as a back-up to my canon 450d.
easy to use
viewfinder - the reason i bought this camera as i find it impossible to use screen in bright conditions.
for me in sunny or very bright conditions); aa batteries (readily available almost everywhere); the various modes make it suitable for most occasions/requirements.
view finder
optical viewfinder! very rare on a camera of this price, but it means you can take pics in sunlight when others are struggling and squinting at screens! well done canon. perfect and pocketable. love it.
not too expensive, compact and light. moulded slightly so it can be held securely when taking shots.
this is my first digital camera and i find it very easy to use.  the view finder is excellent for taking pictures on the beach etc in bright sunshine.
i've been pleased with the results i've had so far and it's nice to handle
good sized screen,optical viewfinder for when it's to bright to see the screen properly,camera sounds can be customised, eg volume level.
it is easy to use, it has a viewfinder and ordinary batteries are a good idea because then you don't have to worry about getting them charged.
has a viewfinder and for someone who wears glasses life is so much easier
viewfinder and all round quality though i've only had camera for a short time
viewfinder focuses with zoom
point and shoot with good results. had cameras in the past with lots of funtions and hardly used them.being able to zoom on video is a plus. aa batteries. view finder
great camera, does exactly what it shouldm have tried others but always go back to cannon. even my husband who is more pro user than me is impressed with this camera. you can't go wrong.
very good macro facility, excellent quality sharp close ups of insects etc.  lightweight, small, packed with features. autofocus is quick and accurate. amazing value
. though not my main camera it means i can always have a camera with me. quality is good enough for most purposes as long as i don't want very large prints.
great camera, really easy to use.
the eye level viewfinder.
fair quality in relation to price. easy to use and for the use i want, perfect. i was looking for a cheap easy to use camera and i believe this fits the bill.
viewfinder/ ease of use
easy to handle, daylight picture quality is really good.
view finder
picture quality is excellent. ovferall a very good camera at a bargain price.
i bought it for my 11 year old, but wished i'd had one on a recent trip as lugging the dslr around was a pain at times! and where i would have need a \xa3300 telephoto lens on the dslr this camera was able to zoom in and focus sharply.
this is a canon an d like all canons it has a glass lens which gives sharp pictures. it is very compact and pocketable. very easy to use. i would describe this as an excellent beginners camera. it has an opticle viewfinder which is usually only available on expensive slr/bridge cameras.
has optical viewfinder (useful for someone like me who needs glasses to see a camera screen). takes pictures nearly as good as my digital slr camera.  extremely cheap for a top quality camera. without it's case, it easily fits my pockets.
stagering image quality for the money - i have some great a4 prints already.....
i wanted something small and portable with good resolution - mainly to photograph meeting notes from wallcharts/whiteboards, as smartphone cameras just don't give the clarity. i got some nice close up shots of the bird that tried to steal my crisps in the new forest
compared to my wifes more powerful compact camera this is as good
good value for the money
excellent price
with an optical viewfinder
value for money.
great value for money.
good brand.  it runs on batteries and so useful backup for my rechargeable camera.  lots of features.  great value for money.
fantastic! takes great quality photos, is compact and has a lot of good effects. seems like it should be more expensive, would definitely reccomend!
light and easy to use and was affordable for a csnon
viewfinder is great when you are in bright sunlight
view finder, aa batteries
very easy to use and oh so easy to understand the instructions for use. i replaced my sony cybershot with this camera not disapointed .good value ,good price
it has a proper viewfinder!
it has a viewfinder!!!!  i'd almost given up hope of finding a compact camera with a viewfinder.  i use a canon slr for most photography, but like to have a compact in my handbag. screens are hopeless in bright sun.  i was so pleased to discover that canon produces a  compact with a viewfinder - and at a reasonable price, too!
lightweight, has view finder,
great that batteries can be used-useful if you have ever forgotten a camera charger on holiday !!
cannon powershot  excellent compact camera a++++
uses aa batteries always available and works well on good quality rechargeable batteries. lots of good preset shooting modes.

very pleased with the camera, excellent value for money, easy to use, viewfinder, aa bateries, excellent image quality.
easy to use,great to have a view finder,software is good.
easy to use, a viewfinder for those bright days
lens, build quality and features are good for the price. and it has a viewfinder - one of the main reasons i bought it.
viewfinder. i only use the display when necessary and use lithium batteries, they seem to last for ever. using the viewfinder also makes it a lot easier to steady the camera. size makes it an excellent pocket camera, i keep it in a sock type case and take it everywhere.
easy to use and bwat size - view finder good in sunny weather
easy to use, compact size for pocket.
the view finder.  i wanted a digital camera with viewfinder, not many available at reasonable price.  this one does the job.
a viewfinder - how many compacts have one? have just returned from a holiday with a lot of sunshine, the screen was useless, and all 200-odd pictures were taken through the viewfinder. the a1200 is worth the price for that alone. altogether a nice camera to use, if just a bit slow.
viewfinder useful, especially in bright light conditions. easy to use straight out of the box. fun special-effects. large monitor.
i bought it because it had a viewfinder and i could easily take photos in sunny conditions when i could not see the screen and so far am finding the camera excellent!!

first camera of this size that i have found with a viewfinder, a very good feature in bright sunlight.

very vesatile. the viewfinder is an important feature for us.
viewfinder
small, lightweight and easy to handle.  i bought this camera because it also had a viewfinder which was essential for me.  i am very pleased with the quality of the photographs and i like the wider angled lens.
big bang for the buck. easy to use. quality photos.
i bought this camera because it had an optical viewfinder having only just abandoned film cameras.it is well built small and light and i like the ability to recall your picture on the large clear screen and cancel all the dud shots.the pictures are good and crisp too.the price, considering all the facilities is more than reasonable.
viewfinder
when you look through the optical viewfinder you can see the end of the lens, has no effect on the picture but it is off-putting
viewfinder, aa batteries
take photos, reasonably intuitive
uses aa batteries. viewfinder extremely useful. good range of shooting options and settings. excellent pocket camera for me.
got a viewfinder

the viewfinder!  so useful on bright days
ease of use for someone who is an anti techno.
really nice little point and shoot camera. i bought it because it has a view finder as well as the display screen as i sometimes find it difficult to see the image on the screen (e.g. in bright / dark conditions).  have read some reviews saying the battery life is short, but i haven't experienced any problems.
at last a camera you can use properly with a view finder wonderful
seems robust, i`ve alreadt dropped it and it seemed to bounce rather well.  comes on quickly and closes quickly
qquick and easy

well worth the small amount of money i paid for it. obviously the more you pay the better the camera! great to actually find a camera with a view finder.
have used it for the past 9 days in singapore and vietnam approx 80 exposures a lot with the flash ,put 2 new duracel bats in to go and still working on return print quality looks good . have rechargable aa s if needed..would recomend
great photos taken, brilliant quality and good value for money
i bought this camera for my wife who can't stand trying to see what her camera was looking at when the sun shines! the viewfinder although small is perfectly adequate for holiday snaps and the picture quality seems fine to me. i had read some reviews which said the quality was not good but it's better than my more expensive olympus.
a great pocket-sized back up for (or alternative to) to your slr.
the camera is easy to use and has lots of good functions which enable you to take better quality pictures and movies so overall its a really good camera.
viewfinder
view finder
i always buy canon and this is an excellent budget digital, handy for carrying around at all times, when my normal canon slr is inconvenient.
ease of use....plenty of pixels for a quality picture......but mainly, an eye lvel view finder
bought for elderly relative wanting basic camera with viewfinder, so this was just about the only one that fitted that requirement.  also, using aa batteries makes it easy for her to buy new ones without having to worry about buying the right ones.  more features than needed so the basic 'set and forget' setting is an excellent idea.

optical viewfinder is usefull in bright conditions. some good creative effects to have fun with. uses aa batteries which are available anywhere.

optical viewfinder. aa batteries.
it has a view finder!  viewfinders are hard to get in this type of camera - i therefore bought 2 'a 1200's.
the use of standard aa batteries is brill. i feel relieved from the tyrrany of a specific battery needing a specific charger. this will be an ideal camera for electricity free camping holidays.
a decent camera, at a reasonable price, with a viewfinder - invaluable in bright sunlight.
optical viewfinder
optical viewfinder - aa batteries - single hand operation is easy
nice and compact, easy to use, but also has extra features if you are more knowledgeable. the macro feature is excellent. i used to have a canon a1,many years ago and am looking forward to playing with this more...
fast start up. good autofocus. bright images. neat styling.
view finder to help see what you are framing when it is a bright day
compact, light-weight and takes great pictures in low light. impressive zoom and no annoying pop-up flash. cool colour and smart metal body. easy to follow menus and clear screen.
i bought this as a camera to take travelling and provide me with first class photos without having endless features that i don't know how to use. the ixus 230 is excellent in all respects. small, light and compact, and cuts to the chase by removing a lot of the manual features that the majority of us don't know how to use, without sacrificing picture quality. would definitely recommend.
easy to take quality photos. looks good. feels robust
perfect pictures, great colours, great manual options
superb image quality for a (relatively) cheap compact.  low light performance is excellent.  plenty of scene modes and the ability to make some limited manual adjustments if you want to.  slow motion video is absolutely amazing and the main reason i chose this camera
the camera is nice, sleek and stylish. i got it in the colour blue and it looks amazing. it takes good quality pictures and its got great camera modes. this is my first personal camera and its pretty decent.
overall a very easy to use camera. we have a digital slr and wanted a small camera to slip into a pocket. this camera meets our needs exactly.
really high quality images in low light conditions. large viewing screen and accurate face recognition. hd video is also really nice too!
auto scene selector and facial recognition.
excellent camera and made a great present for the wife.  she wanted a camare that would take good photos in low light and this works well.
only had it for a month but what i have seen so far: the many features and functions are surprisingly simple to use. it produces excellent image quality, indoor even 'very good' without flash. the metal casing gives it a robust feeling.
bought to replace ageing pentax which which didn't always focus in low light situations, but you couldn't always tell on the tiny screen. this camera focuses sharply every time no matter what the light levels are and the size of the screen gives a very good indication of the photo quality.
just a fabulous point and shoot camera. absolutely love it and have had some stunning photos of a range of subjects since buying it less than a month ago. amazing
small, good image quality, fast, great zoom for such a small camera, great price.  as this model is now not the newest, you don't pay for the unnecessary gimmicks such as 16mp and wi-fi that newer ones have, but you still get a great camera.  a significant step up from all phone cameras.
fabulous camera, very easy to use and small enough for your pocket.
compact, easy to use
good image quality in low light conditions eg gigs
small, neat and great images
this is a great little camera. compact, light-weight and very handy for popping in your bag or pocket. i upgraded from the ixus 120 recently, which i took with me anytime i went anywhere interesting. it's perfect as a 'point and shoot' camera, although the 230 hs has plenty of other features. the movie facility is handy for capturing street scenes, events, people etc. highly recommended.
there have been criticisms of its controls, but they follow the previous canon style and i don't have any problem with them.
qual of image massive improvement on what i had before.
solidly built, good image quality, clear large screen
very quick startup, video button great idea, really pleaseed with it
a very easy to use small compact camera which is ideal for everyday use. good images on both prints and video
the picture quality is really good, even compared with a previous canon ixus.  i haven't looked at all the features available as just wanted to take some snaps and it did the job brilliantly.  very happy with my purchase.
easy to use pretty much intuitive controls.
perfect for casual photography, although i have used on some olympic sporting events and it coped well.
reasonable price
excellent value easy to use.
the camera itself is also very aesthetically pleasing to look at, and for who want it, the camera is available in a range of colours.
not had a chance to do very much with it yet - still getting to know my way round the functions.
bought for a parent who didn't want anything too complicated, no complaints
easy and portable camera, well worth the money. you can even mute it so you don't get all the annoying sounds!
excellent colours, flash brilliant and nice and small
lots of different styles of shot taking and feels like you can take photoshop pictures right there.happy it does what it says on the tin kinda thing
compact. easy to slip into pocket or handbag. great zoom.
lightweight and small
very easy to use,lovely clear photos
very  compact and lightweight
great image quality, fast power on time so ready to take photos very quickly, slow motion video for fun shots of bomb diving a pool! good zoom at x8 but with digital zoom too you can get really close to the action without too much depreciation in quality.  very neat and smart camera.
stylish design, a wealth of functionalities and, most important, quickly ready to take a picture.

for a hassle free just point and shoot camera this ticks all the right boxes no more are the days for getting home and kicking you self and thinking only if
quick and easy to use.
this camera has a good lens to match a high resolution sensor (12 mp cmos), which together produce great photos (and movies). and for the price, brilliant value.
takes great photos, small, compact and easy to use!:)
great all rounder at the price to keep in your pocket.
read lots of reviews before purchasing this for my daughter for christmas. excellent build and image quality, fits in my daughters hand bag as she wanted it instead of all ways carrying around her digital slr. more than happy as excellent camera for a very good price.
love the multi focus feature it really helps.
every thing about it is good what else is there to say.
this a very smart looking camera and very compact. it has a large screen and produces very clear shots without having to manually intervene........ and all at a very very reasonable price.
each of my three daughter have one, ages 12 to 16. they experiment with the features and have great fun. great pictures and features, at this price great value.
when you find your way around the canon menu.
small and compact, but feels sturdy and well made.

compact camera
excellent camera and value for money as you would expect from canon.

(i don't know why canon has discontinued this camera after a short production life because it seems to be better than its replacement.)
build quality, speed, size of screen
excelent picture quality
great images. great video.
compact, easy to use, looks good
small and compact. easy to use as i previously owned a canon ixus and many of the features are easy to use, and in some respects they are even easier on the ixus 230 hs compact digital camera. i tend to use mine for close up, normal and zoomed in images. good viewing display and larger than on my previous camera.
easy to use and good quality photos. used as point and shoot for a 2 week hols and most shots look spot on.

battery charger does from 100v to 240v so can be used in us and europe.  adapter for uk use supplied.
good image quality, easy to use, brilliant 20x zoom.
it is very versatile for a big variety of situations, with a supper zoom - all right at hand. and depending on the photographer he/she will easily have professional pictures with it.
easy to use, large screen, full hd movie mode, and plenty of other options.
good zoom range.
easy to use and keeps your image in focus as your moving the camera around, which is great when taking pictures of children. also can play with the settings manually to get great shots. very compact which fits in bags and pockets. love this camera.
excellent screen, ease of use and image quality, especially with the extras functions. the zoom is excellent and with a bit of practice you can get normal angle quality with this 20x zoom, highly recommend it, and you can carry it in your pocket!

i havnt played around with the features yet so didnt mark it higher
image quality is superb and good features from point and shoot to more creative photography
very comfortable to hold. simple to use as a point and shoot but has extra features if required, that i will explore  once  i am more familiar with the camera.   love the 20x zoom.  much better build than a similar fujji camera that i purchased and then returned from another supplier earlier this year.
versatile and easy to use.
canon sensor
comfortable in the hand ,auto makes it easy to use
picture quality is excellent in my opinion.  there are so many features available i am still working my way through them all, so far so good. the g.p.s does work, it located the pictures to within a couple of metres of location although the tracking doesn't seem to follow the actual route taken when displayed on pc.   maybe i just don't fully understand it yet!   the camera feels solid and well built.  the price i paid was great value, i don't think i would have paid full price.  for me the camera does all i want.
a compact camera which does everything i want it to. it has a brilliant zoom - although a little 'fuzzy' at full zoom. the camera looks good and i found it very easy to get started. i took children having fun and it coped with the movement well. i haven't yet tried the video and there are a lot of other features which i haven't had chance to look at yet!
ease of use and quality of image
all the bells and whistles and a canon camera.  i wanted a camera with a good zoom to take photos of architectural features on large buildings.
just seems very good all round except ...
good zoom and clear pictures, hd video. easy to use and advanced for experienced photographers.
excellent quality images in a lovely, compact camera with a lot of features
ease of use good picture quality good screen
the video quality is fantastic!

instantly easy to use
very good image quality and great zoom. some good useful features and manual controls.
features are the same s larger canon soo it is easy to adapt.
i bought this for my wife who is always disappointed with the pictures from her camera phone and so far she has been impressed with the image quality and the various settings
easy to hold, dead easy to use and looks good. shop-around for cases most are way to big and clumsy.
light, convenient to carry, excellent zoom for small cam

small,portable and with many features found on much more expensive cameras. good value.
'macro'. still getting to grips with other features. pictures so far have been great, even at night.  huge improvement on previous camera (pentax). would highly recommend particularly for a casual user like me.

excellent still image quality. movie quality also very good. anti-shake works well on long zoom. well built and simple layout of controls. with a good class 10 card, the shot to shot time is reasonably quick. battery life good. small enough to carry anywhere, but still big enough to provide decent handling. this is my third canon in this series.
would recommend it as a good camera for beginners and also for more advances users.
easy to use
easy to use
easy to use and seems quite sturdy. the price was the main selling point for me. seems a good quality camera for the money but i have not used it much yet. time will tell.
i wanted a bit more than a point and shoot, and also small enough to put in my bag, but big enough i could actually hold it and press the buttons.  so after looking at several cameras we came up with this model.  so far i am very pleased with it, and the picture quality seems very good.  there are also enough programmes to make it interesting to experiment with but not so complicated to put you off.
zoom, tracking, separate video button
features and value for money
amazing number of functions
he loves it and he uses it all the time.

great modern camera.  touch screen helps as can focus on the exact point of interest

easy to use but has the option to go to manual setting gradually. useful for me being a dslr novice :)
good value for money
video recording with good autofocus
lens has great range.
ive had several canon powershot cameras this is the best yet.very good pictures from such a small camera.also the vidio is superb.
manual controls; fast processor and excellent image quality
appears solidly built and the results are superb
small and easy to pack hand baggage on cheap fligths. allows you to take control but will make decisions for you dials well laid out low light performance excellent a serious photographers compact.
if you do street photography, this is for you!
some great features makes it a great substitute for my dslr.
i have had two g9s so the g15 is an updated version of what i am used to.  it has a faster lens, which is great, and is excellent for video.  i am pleased the makers still use mainly metal in its construction, so it is more rugged than its rivals.  also pleased to see canon returning to a fixed screen, rather than the swivel screen that has limited use and made the camera bulkier.
solid feel about camera.
good zoom and picture quality for the price and size of this camera.
which is a sign of quality.
great solid camera and although i know nothing about them, the image quality is brilliant and perfect for promotional work.
good manual (on dvd or download) - did explain the options well.
wonderful quality pics even in low light, provided you set up for the pic properly. solid build, relatively compact size compared to dslr camerals.
among many others, good low light performance. very close focusing in macro.  viewfinder useful in bright sunlight. i like that the flash needs manually raising to avoid it operating without being asked.
very good value for money.
small, light, compact and incredibly good value.  a really professional camera without the weight and bulk of a dslr.
very sharp image quality, good lens, nice saturation. very nice compact camera. just buy it, you can't go wrong with canon g-series.
the g16 only has movie at 30fps hence i bought the g15
sturdy excellent quality loads of features and far more portable than a digital slr
build quality...lens quality,,,size good to handle.....
just quality
easy to use. nice size. good image quality.
great camera you can take it anywhere has a viewfinder
an amazing array of clever features, provided you can remember how to access them.  very compact and easy-to-carry with viewfinder for very bright light as well as lcd screen.
looks good
smaller and lighter than my previous g10
early days yet so i every thing seems ok
you can take several fotos without waiting for processing
easy to use
easy to use and quality of pictures
versatile bridge camera which is fast and responsive
vewfinder, and no wifi to reduce the quality of the camera, because i want a quality compact camera not a device to connect to whatever!
excellent build quality,great compact camera if you don't want to carry a bulky dslr .
small, easy to use, great aperture, built like a tank
great build quality,solid  feel.this is an ideal camera as a back for a dslr,which you don`t want to carry about on holiday,image quality is excellent in low light,and day time,sunny conditions do make it awkward to see in the lcd viewfinder,the optical one being of little use to be honest.altogether a worthy addition to any keen photographer,recommended.
all good
i wanted both view-finder and lcd display on a small (as compact as possible) camera.  this camera is perfect.
solidly built with excellent image quality.
view finder
bomb proof, fast lens, amazing image quality from such a pocketable camera, even a high iso produces a very acceptable image when run through decent (nik) noise reduction software. it's not a high end dslr and it doesn't pretend to be, what it is, is a high end compact that produces outstanding results when you're on holiday and your 5d isn't.
easy to take picture
not too heavy considering it's many facilities and options.  i look forward to using it on holiday instead of hauling my canon 7d plus lenses.  eye level viewfinder is very useful.
easy to use with menu giving explanations to items on menu
lens quality
this compact is perfect, both for the photographer who only wishes to obtain superb images from the full auto programme and for the advanced photographer who enjoys using the more creative aspects the camera has to offer.
tr\xe8s bon appareil super photos
gives very good picture quality for a compact camera; gives control over all settings making it suitable for most situations; seems to be very well made and robust; very clear screen; optical viewfinder makes it usable in situations where screen cannot be seen.
great alternative to slr
well designed.  i do like to have an optical viewfinder; there are so few compacts fitted with one these days.  this one is goodwhen the sun shines on the screen.
quality of build, awesome aperture, fast and agile, easy to carry (not the smallest but small enough for travels). quick control for exposure control. you can\xb4t go wrong with this one.
wonderful big screen
solid construction. raw capture. triple exposure captures. excellent photos.
small, fast, easy to use, low price, not heavy
low light effectiveness, ease of use, size, video ease of use and quality, and use of telephoto in videoing
ease of use and excellent results so far.  wantewd this model to replace g9 and it certainly does that.
fast belt to shoot time, everything seems quicker and sharper than my g12
solid build
small enough to pop in a pocket and take anywhere with good quality build and plenty of features.
just love it
great camera for photography enthusiasts
big enough buttons
nice compact size,great pictures,plenty of features,and it`s a canon,feels good in the hand,i`m very pleased with my purchase,hope to have it for years to come.
image quality
smaller and more pocketable than the g11/g12. the f/1.8 lens is better for low light shots and therefore (for me) the camera is more useful. the autofocus seems faster than the g12. great for close-ups/macro with amazing 1cm distance from subject. battery charge life seems to last forever. great little camera! excellent image quality and great features. video quality is amazing!
easy to use, quality, program,...
good value for money while provides all the best features needed by an enthusiast photographer. f2.8 aperture @ 140mm zoom makes a lot of difference
easy to use..great quality images. i am a commercial photographer and use to use my iphone as my main casual camera but wanted a camera that had images big enough to edit and use without the light being blown out. this camera is amazing and highly recommend it as a casual camera + it fits in your back pocket!
la qualit\xe9 de fabrication et d'image la taille qui permet de mettre le g15 dans la poche
small, useful and with many professional camera options. it's almost perfect!
light  and compact
this camera has everything you need.
compact size, lightness. menu system a bit long-winded sometimes.
very easy to use, the battery charged very quickly and the camera was ready to shoot within 2 hours and obtained very good results on full auto first time out. very impressed with lens quality and ease of use. there are many features and it will take sometime to discover its full capabilities. a big plus and the reason for my choice is the hd video and the ability to view through the view finder and also on the screen. very pleased with my choice.
had canon cameras all my life, had others too but have never failed with quality, ease of use. would always recommend them,
i was looking for a dslr camera for a very long time and after reading all the reviews i decided to buy the canon eos1100d, i have taken atleast 3000 pictures in the last 1 month but i havent explored the manual focus yet , i am still using the auto focus which makes life a lot easier so i am not really bothered about the manual focus and cant comment on it.when you zoom a nearby object and take a picture in auto focus mode in normal day light , the picture quality is simply mind blowing...i would definitely recommend this camera over nikon d3100 ( exactly the same spec as canon eos1100d ) as there is an option to atleast use another lens , just in case.nikon wont take any other lens...
initial lense 18-55m. i've only had the camera for 1 month, so am still finding me feet with it. however, i'm glad i made the purchase.
great entry level dslr camera.
easy to use and very lightweight.
this camera is certainly good for a starter. it has very good picture details as color and size. very easy to carry and use. good shutter speed compared to other cameras and as a beginner cam as well. battery back up is good.
great price considering there are so many features.
its my first dslr camera and i am very happy with the results.
amazing battery life, on the first charge got 2 weeks use out of it. (not using flash much though)
very good starting camera for anyone wanting to take more than quick snapshots.
decent image quality.
can use the camera like a 'point and shoot' or by looking at the display panel to take a picture.
for those of us old enough to remember film based slr cameras this reminds me of those great cameras that i never got to own. it is a lovely gift.
1st slr i have had and found it really easy to use and the image quality has been superb. i'm sure you can get better with much more expensive cameras, but with this they are great.
fool-proof prompts when using 'non-auto' features.
easy to use and great for first time buyers that need an slr to start off with
easy to use and a delight to hold.
great images intuitive menus, love it.
pic quality
easy to use, provides some excellent results, loads of available accessories, great price!
easy to setup quick and get snapping with most of if not all of the abilities as the big boys out there.
very good camera, excellent picture quality and very user friendly.
i have just upgraded to slr and i'm delighted that this canon has been so easy to use and gives superb photos.
very good camera for a beginner like me. manual very clear and fairly easy to understand. pictures are excellent both in auto mode and creative mode. highly recommended
feel, weight, pic quality, so easy to use,
easy to use for a first time dlsr user , quality of the pictures is outstanding compared to the compact digital camera i had.

it has hd video recording....nice
brilliant camera for a beginner.  easy to use.
good picture images
a present for my daughter who is studying textiles at university. she has found it very easy to use and the image quality is very impressive.
very easy to use excellent starting camera
brilliant camera, amazing images from this camera.
a specification good enough to advance to a reasonble level of competence whilst not being over-faced with menus and functions that cannot be understood. the is lens is worth the little bit extra.
nicely put together and very quick shots. image quality very impressive.
easy to change the lens, has brillaint image quality and is a good camera to have for first time dslr users.
fantastic camera outfit for the money!
versatile and with good defaults.
best middle range camara

it is the cheapest dslr camera on the market and offers good value for money.
great camera, lots of functions, not too heavy! easy to use without having to read lots about the camera
easy to use camera for someone who never used dslr camera before and also for professional photographer
great starter camera, excellent functionality and picture quality is really good. used with a f/1.8 50mm lens you can get great looking pictures with excellent depth of field.
takes great photos buy a better zoom lens
cheap. easy to use in automatic mode.
excellent camera for beginners to this type of camera.

easy to use, comfortable to handle.
simple for a new camera user to get used to, straight forward menu options.
nice dlsr starter camera with clear instructions
this camara is excellent,  the images are great and still lots to learn and explore.
this camera takes fantastic pictures and has a vast range of settings and features which all relatively easy to use, even for a complete amatuer. it also looks good and all the controls are very intuative.
easy to get started. battery life excellent.
video shooting is also very easy, and a very useful feature. if you don't want it, just don't use it, but when you do want it your not loosing time fnding your camcorder.
very good quality of images when using high iso level (to 1200), easy to hold, all fonctionnality as well as a reflex.
the sharp and vibrant quality of the image is outstanding. time frame between pressing the shutter and capturing the shot is almost instantaneous once the lens has focused. diversity of the camera is excellent in relation to capturing  various media subjects utilising the various types of lens available.
this was my first slr, and in all honesty, i expected to have to learn the manual before using. but it is so easy to use, you literally can just turn it on and shoot, as it offers settings that enable you to do that. image quality is sharp and crisp, and it is just an awesome piece of kit. i recommend it to all!
would recommend it to any one thinking of purchasing a dslr for the first time.  there are many accesories which can be purchased for thie camera, and i would recommend a half decent zoom lense if you are interested in wildlife shooting.
the kit lense 18-55mm is is good starting point, you will be looking soon to expand your lense collection (old slr canon ef fit is compatible)
a spare lp-e5 battery.
1080p video is superb providing you're not trying to make a movie but then most people, even with a good camcorder, aren't.
great camera to use a good balance between pro and amateur for settings, you can be creative or let the camera take control.
a dslr with hd video, 15.1 mp enough said
the new larger, more high res screen is great even in bright sun. the 18-55 is kit lens is much better than previous canon kit lenses for basically a cheap lens
image quality, but see below.  image quality in poor light without flash. comfortable to hold.  good quality results with jpeg, no need to use raw.
i have never owned a dslr before but found it easy to pick up the camera and get going without any reading up. learning by fiddling about with settings is fairly easy. more advanced things require reference to the manual, which is small enough to keep handy. the photos look brilliant, and comparisons with other camera-owners seem to suggest that the 500d has more features for the price than anything else. the light weight of the camera is a bonus when carrying it around all day or shooting single-handed.
great images ~ really sharp with excellent colour reproduction . the camera copes extremely well with wierd lighting too ~ like a shot i took of a lit candelabra. took a while to get used to the automatic focus override and am still getting to grips with the manual functions but that could be my problem! the camera is comfortable to hold and light to carry ~ another plus factor for me.
clear display of current settings; very fast in taking exposures after pressing shutter; fast auto-focus
light weight, good big screen and menu's easy to follow.
fast and easy to use in preset modes. once the manual modes are managed very easy to use.
used to work with nikon but wanted to experience canon, good light camera, sensor cleaning and stabilizer are a plus, large lcd screen very handy. a bit confused at the beginning since it is a bit different from nikon but at the end all quite clear and overall a very good camera.
excellent qualit feel to the camera, more than an entry level dslr but less daunting and costly than a pro camera. its perfect for avid photographers who want to have more control over their images. great for creative photographers, image quality is excellent!
image quality
i absolutley love my new camera, it's so easy to use the instruction booklet is easy to read and understand - very unusual for this kind of thing!
overall a very good more than entry level d-slr, and know the price has come down more a very worthwhile purchase.
excellent set features. extremely good build quality for the price. fantastic lcd monitor. ef-s 18-55mm is lens kit is good value. a truly professional camera.
excellent image quality. easy to use functions. lightweight and not too bulky.
a brilliant camera for a complete novis who want to take great photo's and improve their photographic skills
i am new to digital slr photography and i was first scared that the camera might be 'too much' for a beginner, but you can just use the full auto mode until you are comfortable with the other modes. the camera also has a 'creative mode', which is similar to full auto but it gives you some more options and it's really intuitive. i am happy with it!
18- 55mm lens better than expected.
my first slr camera .it was a great choice,highly delighted with it.
changing from photo mode to video is seamingless.
, i am now abe to take advantage of all of the additional features that this type of camer offers. the quality of the pictures taken has now improved dramatically e.g. i can see where the focus point is and so i am not disappointed that the background is in focus but the subjecy isn't on the final image, backgrounds are blurred on portraits when i want them to be.
and i have no issues with holding the camera..
feels well built, pretty small and light for a dslr.  photo quality is outstanding, no complaints about the kit 18-55mm lens which gives sharp detailed snaps.  manual focus ring is fantastic to use.  very happy indeed with the 500d!
just an amazing camera. really intuitive to use. this is the reason canon are so well liked
an excellent first time into serious photography buy. having a great time with my camera learning all my settings on manuel and when i need to opting for the pre set modes. recomended buy.
very light.easy to handle.very,very sleek!
the size look and weight of the 500d is impressive, this shows its good build quality. 15.5/15.1 mega pixels make it perfect for post production and give you good scope to digital zoom and keep the quality. settings display screen is that out of the 50d 920.000 pixels, would put most tvs to shame. lens is great for landscapes and group photos, also portraits, indoors also good with its good f stop. is so worth every penny.
light weight, easy to use
it is a fabulous product which opens up your taste for photography and pushes you to new heights of trying to get that better picture.i am delighted with the results and hope to be able to get a better lens soon to improve my pictures even better.
great picture quality, very sharp - accessible price.
easy to start off using,but have the tools to be creative being fully manual,.my first dslr having used canon eos film up to now,and i'm pleased with it.
easy ty use, good image quality, a good all round camera.
i bought the camera to take on a safari holiday. most of the pictures i took were in auto mode and i must say the quality is fantastic, i am looking forward to using some of the advanced features over the coming months.
lightweight comfortable product, easy functions, excellent results exactly what you would expect from a canon
anyone can use it, just pick it up, turn it on and shoot.  lots of automatic settings which is great for me as a novice. easy to change lenses.
excellent all round camera, great quality pictures and easy to use.
the camera is spot on everything is good
easy to use excellent quality
this is an excellent camera and easy to use, the results are extremely sharp.
features (hd video, shooting modes), build and image quality
an exceptionally easy to use camera.  well worth the money and i would recommend it to anyone looking to step up from a standard digitial camera.
not too heavy and good to handle. excellent picture quality. proper macro feature as opposed to some cameras where it means you can focus only slightly nearer than normal.
advanced camera with all slr features. well built
light to carry, easy to use slr camera. iq excellent.
seems very straightforward to use with excellent picture quality
easy to use and has enough functions to span from using the camera as a complete novice to using the camera as an experienced photographer.
good item easy to use... even for a beginner like me!
simple to use but with lots of features that you can use as you get better. great image qualities
i'm a beginner in photography but the camera is so easy to use and learn to use. even the manual is clear and concise!

everything's good about the canon eos 500d.

n/a
relatively compact and not too heavy to carry around. a very good entry-level slr.
this is a fantastic camera suitable for any conditions. great in low light or overbright conditions.takes super sharp pictures and is compatible with any lens and extender.good colours easy to use.well recommended
high resolution, 9 point focus, face recognition, large viewing screen and all the functions i expect from canon.  what more could i ask for?  this is just the camera i have been waiting for!
awesome shutter speed and image burst and excellent screen. battery life very good. still learning all the features but it has surpased my expectations.
excellent rear screen definition and more rapid/accurate focusing than earlier model (i previously had canon 20d dslr). pictures quality higher (15 megapixel) and hdmi output provides excellent viewing on lcd tv. shutter quieter than 20d and more rapid multiple shot sequences. works well with a range of lenses.
great leap from my 400d. loads of added and useful features, great build quality. new screen is fantastic.
live view, which i'll admit i initially though was a gimic has already saved me crawling around on the floor to get a low vantage point... i'll happily stand corrected on that point.
greatly improved rear screen.
picture quality is brilliant.
first class camera would highly recommend.
fantastic pictures straight out of the box.  i have never had a camera which takes better pictures.  i use it for wildlife shots on my farm and am very happy - even when enlarging pictures many times.
plenty of pixels, excellent build quality, faster and better processor, large screen with easy to navigate menus, sensor cleaning system.
excellent camera - handles well and does everything you need.
easy to use as a back up for my eos 1d. excellent image quality and plenty of professional features. the magnesium body makes it ideal for heavy use.
larger lcd display,easier menu layout,quick focusing ,increased pixel count, build quality.
image quality
feels very comfortabel to hold ,easy to use,very sturdy build, images better now that i have altered the settngs to personal preferences would recomend it to anyone
an excellent camera, very good features and very good quality of the images. becide the fact that it is a profetional slr it has some fanction that make it as easy as a point and shoot.
solid build, great image quality and more functionality than i know what to do with (yet). i'd been using a 350d for a number of years and wondered for a long time whether upgrading would be worth it. the answer is a definite yes.
very easy to use straight for the box. superb upgrade option and signifgicant improvement from a 300d/350d/20d or 30d.
its not the first expensive camera that ive had but it is the best
i upgraded from a canon eos 400d (which i loved) as i have become a lot more proficient with my photography skills. i got to the stage where there were limitations with what my 400d could do for me. i was torn between going for the 500d or this 50d. i wasn't bothered about the videoing capabilities of the 500d so opted for the 50d. i like the sturdy feel and can look forward to getting to grips with the many different features available.
very well balanced camera, feels good to handle.  the speed of the camera is breathtaking, everything about the camera screams quality.
ease of use,ability to shoot in very low light,with excelent results,
very good all around
its a good few steps up from my 450d and i am still experimenting with it
excellent value for money camera
live view
it`s just a very good camera
very impressed with this camera over all pic quality and shutter speed
solid, quality feel as with all canon top of range products, familiar to use as this range has not changed much from the 10d up
live view,good build quality,good range of acessories.
its a canon dslr they are the best
i have just upgraded from a 450d and i can say this 50d is real quality at a bargin price. it just feels right, for shooting horses showjumping it is great with just over 6 fps i never miss a good picture, the 450d just couldn't quite keep up. battery life is great, just shot about 900-1000 frames on first charge (admittedly no flash used). i shot some photos at a wedding yesterday and they've come out great, even with low light in the church, images have come out sharp and clear. all in all its a great camera and i would even recommend it over a 7d if all you need is a still camera, i still don't understand why people want to use a dslr to shoot video, but then again i'm probably short sighted. i recommend getting some quality glass to go with this beauty, i bought a canon 24-105 l and its ace. by far the best two purchases i have made towards better photography.
its a canon
made in the cannon mould
capacity seems to be higher than original, which is 1390mah. this has 1800mah.
navigation,easy to use,very handy body
informative preview screens with focus points showing
excellent piece of kit.
all of the above
an excellent camera giving good sharp pictures
this is my first digital camera and i,am very pleased with it,cannot find any faults with it so far.
large screen, large image size, good colour sensitivy
excellent build quality and 21 mp can't be bad either!!!!!!!!!!!
+ high iso results much better than the 450d
great product, great price, you can use the canon charger to charge and i think it lasts longer than the canon battery
same as canon one.
great feel to the camera
really good for image quality and pretty easy to use! and the value is really good i think
three raw sizes
light, great picture quality, fun to use!
as good as the original canon battery. can't tell the difference except of course the price.
build quality is excellent  with a metal body. image quality is very good with the right lens and is still pretty good at high iso. large high resolution screen for image review. liveview feature. around 6 fps for sports/wildlife is very useful.  2 programmable modes is very nice.
upgraded fro a 350d - it is solid and stable and has excellent quality  - the 15+megapixels make a difference. lot sof fetauers which serve me well and more!!
excellent product ,  great pictures,
haven't had it for too long, but i'm able to take great pics fairly early on with the kowledge that there is still huge amounts of untapped potential once i get the many features sussed. a well built body that,for me, feels comfortable when i handle it.
great features and build quality. 15mp!! super clear display screen and fast focusing.
excellent features, super picture quality, very nice robust feel to this camera with a magnesium body, the creative settings and high iso settings make this a very versatile piece of kit.
great follow on camera from the basic eos 400d
excellent images, ease of use and and the ergonomics.
excellent low light perfommance.
i've had the time to test the camera for a couple of months over a few jobs (wedding/portrait/personal) and it has performed without fault. image quality is great. untouched raw files (i havne't shot in jpeg) seem to have a much deeper colour to them. (my previous camera was a 30d.) low iso is amazing, though not as good as d700. i tested them both together in the same conditions. focus at central point is good. could always be better, but this is just like saying i could always do with more money. have not tested camera in rain etc so can't say how it performed but it does take the careful use i've given it so far. viewfinder much better. live view focusing very useful for still life - however don't forget it will murder you batteries!
love the upgrade view screen on back, the detail in your images can be seen very clear when zoomed right in or out great feature. all in all very good camera, as i only have taken about 500 pics i have got some true good images. the full frame images it produces is a real bonus having not had a camera like this before, but i can get used to this very quickly.
this has to be the camera of choice within the canon range.  already owning and well practiced on the mark 1 5d it is very easy to use as there is very little difference between the two in function applications.  the main differences are:- 1) it has an automatic sensor cleaning function.  the lack of this on the mark 1 was very annoying. 2) the build quality - better dust and water proofing. 3) fantastic depth of image with 21 megapixels. 4) very clear image screen.  there must be more, but having been spoilt with the mark 1, the other advantages over lesser cameras have been lost on me.
image quality is the best i have seen. the detail is astounding. high iso noise performance is great as well. much better than my 40d. i was extremely happy with my old 40d but the difference in image quality between that and the 5dmk2 is incredible and certainly justifies the extra money.
i've been a canon user all my photographic life and the familiarity is great. the full frame chip brings all the lenses back in to play and the 21mpx allows me to use this camera proffesionally. the screen on the back is large, clear and crisp and the new menu system is much easier to use. starting to play with the hd video and that with the 35mm lenses is superb.
it's like having two cameras for the price of one, each of which i would have been more than happy to buy for the price. you get a great full-frame stills camera that uses the full focal length of the lens and has gorgeous bocah. then you get to transport much of this across to an full hd camera which uses all the lens. this camera is justly praised and its popularity and people-power leads canon to update the firmware to allow for 24p and manual audio.
overall a stunning camera with superb image quality and features.
it is a stunning piece of equipment. sturdy, well built. even though it is heavy, it feels comfortable to hold. image quality is superb, but watch out for the lenses you use. you really notice the difference between an average lens and a great lens on this camera!
image quality is excellent, both stills and video
very good as i already have the 5d mk i
a full frame dslr with excellent image quality. very good value for money when compared against the other canon option of a 1dsmk2. easy to upgrade to from a 40d or similar with all controls virtually the same. battery life so far has been excellent and well in excess of the canon stated value. autofocus with moving subjects like aircarft has been very good.
outstanding. everything i'd been waiting for
having moved from other canon's to the 5d mk ii, it is very easy to use and the image quality is superbe.
build quality is very good indeed, cannot be bettered unless your prepared to spend twice as much.
great pro spec camera with lots of mega pixels. it does the job very well.
there is a optical correction for your eye's dioptric, which is an excellent feature.
fantastic dof, image quality and iso performance.
best digital camera canon have made no bad points.
great picture quality - the ability to control and manipulate what you want to. love the sensor cleaning feature.
great image quality, good noise levels, if you upgrade from a 40d you will be familiar with most of the menu settings, very easy to use considering the quality of images it produces, but you do need top quality optics to do the camera justice.
lack of noise even at very high iso. auto iso is great for weddings coming from inside a church to bright sunlight. the very clear and concise menu.
summarizing: i'm very happy to be the owner!
absolutely a beauty! i was tempted in going for the 7d for some extra features but finally i decided to go full frame! perfect!
farily simple to get to grips with the features of this camera and if you have owned a canon 30d it is so simler to gether that you soon get to grips with all the features and enhancements. value for money you can't beat the canon camera range.
image quality is superb
excellent quality of image and shallow depth of field. in all excellent.
high iso speeds, new battery maintenance system, new batteries, faster shooting, hd recording, improved resolution, improved interface, sensor cleaning, large lcd screen, live view.
a truly awesome piece of kit for still images resolution. this 21 megapixel beast will knock spots off 10 megapixel resolutions when blown up to a3 and larger. good solid build quality and feel. worth every penny although the hd movie mode has some way to go on the sound recording - picking up all extraneous noise. nice clear viewfinder from this full frame model is reminisscent of the early 35mm film cameras. built in flash would be handy but with iso of 6400 extendable, low light possibilities are good. nice clear screen for playback and live-view.
a fantastic full frame sensor still camera, and with the new firmware update it's possibly the most versatile video camera available - achieve depth of field effects simply unavailable for anything at this price.
having used various canon slr's i am most impressed, i just cannot fault any part of it.
excellent full frame image quality, big resolution images that easily print at a3 at 300dpi, a significant leap over my old crop sensor eos 50d, fantastic quality video footage especially with l series glass,  superb contrast and colour reproduction,
superb image quality, full frame sensor, excellent lcd display, greatly improved menu layout and options compared to 5d mk 1, video capability, particularly like the 3 custom settings available on the main mode dial
image quaulity camera user settings,quick control screen, battery logging, build quaulity and handling.
all the quality of mk1 plus improved picture standards
very high pixel count for the money, in an excellent body. when you factor in the video capability, there is little in the way of competition. batteries last well and can be topped up. get a good quality glass protector for the viewing screen.
perfect body. i used 40d then 50d and 60d but 5d is much better
great to use, excellent results especially with the large screen.
if you are upgrading from a smaller canon camera you will find the 5d comfortable and easy to use. plus it is simply superb quality.
fantastic camera all round. high-end quality at a really cheap price. photos and video look amazing
pic quality is excellent, you can take natural pics, high iso capability means that you don't have to rely on flash (camera does not have an in-built one anyway).
i have used the 5d mki for many years so was unsure whether to upgrade to the mkii but am extremely pleased that i have.  the image quality is excellent and i am loving shooting at high isos.  having the built in sensor cleaning puts my mind at ease and so far i haven't had any problems with dust spots despite numerous lens changes. i also really rate the screen brightness which i have set on automatic and can now see my shots perfectly even in bright sunlight.
1080p hd video
quality
amazing stills and amazing hd video (depends on your lenses of course). i showed my initial test footage to my sister-in-law, who is a tv documentary producer, and she was astounded by its clarity and film like quality
superb iq, feature set and video dof.
cracking camera. had an eos400d and the change in picture quality is very big.
the canon 5d i find very good i have upgraded from a 450d and find the 5d much better image quality is very good and the video is top class
the settings panel displayed on the rear screen are an excellent way of adjusting settings without having to peer down at the top panel.
easy to use
excellent image quality. good high iso performance
for me, image quality and ease of use.
high quality results.
excellent camera, a must buy.
nice video output too
all good
complete manual control over shooting options
first class piece of kit been saving up to get this body well worth it
suberb image quality i have the 5d mark 1 too so found it very easy to get to grips with.
build quality is up to usual canon pro standards.
light, relatively easy to use for a digital newby like me, great pictures, easy to use software.  the only reason i didn't rate it 10 for everything but price is i'm still really learning what it can do.
the 5d mark ii is a different world from the 400d i came from when i upgraded.  not only does the full frame capture a great range of detail, but the resolution and iso performance are really amazing.  the build quality is fantastic, the camera is a good size and weight even when using larger lenses like the 70-200 or 100-400.  battery life is great, you can even track battery performance via individual batteries and their serial numbers (if you use canon stock.)  overall, this is a knock out camera, highly recommended if you're looking for a reasonably priced full frame body and already have an investment in canon/ef glass.
fantastic camera. the quality of the images are outstanding. obviously requires l lens. if used to canon cameras it is easy to use. i bought it for the image quality also the increased iso settings.
great camera
image quality is superb.can shoot full 1080hd video with use of a mutitude of diferent lenses.
people will be talking about this camera in years to come... image quality, low light capability, size, price considering it's full frame. video.
amazing image quality
stupendous image quality and great colour rendition.
solid canon product
easy to use - great quality images with moving subjects and camera shake very minimal
sensor size and dust removal
already a canon user, this was a short learning curve. image quality is what i was after and it is superb. save money, don't by the fastest lens or the longest lens, just use higher iso (low noise) and pull up the centre of the image if you can't fill the frame. seemples!
great built quality, produces fantastic colours and i love having a full frame sensor
it is good value for money
the good pionts are the pixal count 21.1 the sensor cleaner ,and i think this a good all round camera for the price
everything is perfect and this is the camera foe 90% photography.
the canon eos 5 d mk ii is a first class great peace of kit. canon are the best as i already have the eos 7d as well.
full frame sensor
quality,solid build, like owning a rolex watch recognized.
23 meg
great ff camera as a backup body - very capable tech.
superb piece of kit!
large clear screen. relatively quick focus.  image quality, but does require the lenses to match
clear lcd
good solid camera with the facilities and imaginative photographer needs
a sturdy well built machine that fits comfortably in the hand. the 21 megapixal censor is way ahead of the field at the moment as is the features and technology.
high quality product at affordable price.
full frame great picture quality, as long as l series lens used
image quality and consistent development from previous model
well specified camera, super quality images, good low light performance.
fantastic quality with great new features like live view and hd movies. a big camera but worth the extra weight to get true professional quality.
hd movie, 21mp, light,
image quality. price.
a camera every pro would love to have
excellent, love it. image quality, noise is considerably lower than my previous camera. feels professional, and great in my hands. also great that even though it is full frame it is capable of using all my other ef lenses. i know some other full frame camera manufactures dont allow this.
superb image quality, crisp clear, no magnification effect (ff)
high image quality, canon range of lenses, works out of the box to some degree.
ease of use
resolution, flexibility
fantastic images; great screen; fun to use
super image quality, well build, great bokeh. good movie mode. love it
one of the best camera!
its well respected professional film makers for a good reason. it has fantastic image quality and is dynamic. its a beautiful camera.
canon quality and versatility.
very resistant, easy to use and great contrast image and color fidelity
love this camera!
great camera for advanced amateurs and professional photographers
just 'good all round'
high quality full frame camera for semi pro and pro photographers. i recommend to anyone.
as above.
incredible image quality, but that's what i would expect from a professional camera. live view has allowed me to get pin-sharp images every time. although some of the features are slightly different from my previous canons, the manual is easy to find one's way round, and now i would struggle to use my previous cameras. it is a wonderful piece of equipment.
excellant camera but aimed ay advanced amateur/professional, ease of use is ok for advanced amateur/professional, but difficult for beginner
image quality
fantastic
full frame sensor
i bought this camera, as an upgrade from my canon 50d i have found the camera easy to use has it has similar controls to the 50d. i am very happy with the quality of the camera, and the great images it produces.

amazing piece of kit
fantastic camera. i can't see me buying a new one for many a year.

quality, iso, full frame sensor, price (compared to mark iii).
plenty of features
lightweight. easy to use, especially if you are a regular canon user. outstanding image quality.
great image quality, super for landscape, wedding and portrait work ...overall great camera!
before i purchased this camera i had a canon500d which was great but now this camera takes my images to a different level.  the sharpness is incredible with sima lenses, ease of use.  i havent found out all the features yet as only had it about 2 weeks but its great
is the mk3 worth twice as much??
fantastic picture quality
an exceptionally good quality camera for it's price.
great solid camera of quality. images are  great and the multitude of settings are brilliant. low light images are amazing even at high iso settings.
everthing
8. just beautiful =)

i love the large display screen and the quick shutter speed means i never miss a picture
excellent picture quality still and video with the advantage of  dual focusing. competitive price, and as it's my first digital camera a huge leap from my old canon sureshot 1980 vintage
easy to use, some good semi-manual features.
dark conditions.fast to react
superb quality image. easy to use and intuitive functions, viewfinder, big screen
small and compact quick start up time
wide angle lens
small, compact, light, easy to use and good quality pictures

excellent handling,good battery life,solid feel ,excellent image quality,good features.8.2 mpixel
it seems to have everything covered and is exactly what i wanted!
easy to use, solid build.
well constructed, controls are egonomically placed, easy to use. plenty of control over camera settings.
it's easy to use as a point and shoot, and equally easy to control as you would any pro slr. it's lightweight and handles really well. the image quality is superb.
all aspects especially the black and white feature. the software is easy to use and comes with raw as well, which is an added bonus.
battery life, even without the additional battery grip is good.
very robust efficient camera good feel
wonderful camera, easy to use, feature packed and superb image quality. it just feels good in your hand.
excellent camera
software supplied also makes life a lot easier.
fast start-up, high speed shooting (upto 5 frames a second), large buffer (take a lot of pictures quickly before it stops to write images to flash card). high quality images at low asa/iso. long lasting battery (i have taken 1000 pictures in 2 days without a recharge).
i bought this as an update to the ixus 700 and was not disapointed both with  the build quality and the end results. afabulous camera that does exactly what it says on the box.
this is an excellent user friendly camera.
anyone can pick the camera up and use it without fuss or difficulty.
wonderful digital camera, easy to use with great images taken everytime.
small size makes it easy to carry around. operation is quite fast.
face recognition, build quality, battery life, resolution.
prints and larger.  focusing is good and will cope with most images.  exposure very consistent and rarely fooled and exposure/focus lock can also be used when necessary. sharper images with this camera than with the eos 350 dogital slr with the canon standard supplied lens!
i bought the camera as a birthday present for my non-technological husband. he loves it and has found it very easy to take high quality photos which he downloads and puts in our village newsletter.
the ixus 900 ti is a compact, easy to use camera, light to carry in my handbag. i also find it a no nonsense camera! the picture quality is of a very high standard. i would recommend it.
super for fitting into top shirt pocket
the quality of the picture even when zooming right in is fantastic.
very easy to use and photo quality very good
build quality, design, features, resolution and compact size.
just what i was looking for.
very good camera
beautifully made, excellent lcd screen, fast, a joy to use
good battery life and the ability to hold plenty of pics if teamed up with a decent size memory stick.
excellent for macro photography. very easy to change settings. focuses well.
i bought this camera to my holidays in greece this year. the features in this camera are amazing. this camera's got different modes such as portrait, fireworks, night, beach, snow... pictures taken on the beach or landscape were perfect. a good tip is - if you want to take pics from sunset put the camera on night mode - the result is fantastic. batteries last long, and the video quality are very good, since it's a camera, not a camcorder. as i read the manual, i could make the most of this camera so i think this is the best value for money and i recommend it!!
easy to use good picture love the screen
easy to use. compact. large screen.
huge lcd, fast autofocus. picture quality is fantastic and the macro mode is surprisingly capable as well.
solid construction, excellent design. really clear large lcd screen. superb pictures
fast response, good image quality and focussing. compact and lightweight. great battery life.
very user friendly
easy to use.  larger lcd is excellent.  small and light to carry.
good night time pictures
size of screen
really good size of viewing screen and very easy to use. nice size for handbag.
great value for money!
brand ...quality of build and ease of use.
crystal clear images (for the pixels it has). face detection so you can easily focus and build the picture. multi-shot function (great for catching the multiple expressions of my twin nieces!)
the best all round digital camera i have ever owned, including dslrs.  it is simple to use, has loads of features, gives fantastic quality images even when enlarged, looks and feels like a very high quality item and fits easily into a shirt pocket, even with the massive screen.  overall it's about the size of a deck of playing cards.  excellent quality video recording as well.  also fits into a canon waterproof / underwater case to use whilst swimming / diving / snorkelling or just to protect it from knocks.
i was bought for quick quality snapping and it does what it says!!! love the really big screen and the fact that it is so compact that i can easily take it anywhere with me. feel that it is very competitively priced against similar cameras and designed really well. like the reasurance of buying a quality make.
excellent camera with straight forward easy to use instructions and a great camera to have in your pocket or handbag for any occasion. excellent build quality and styling.
very small and lightweight but with a large, easy to view screen. face recognition function is good.
it's great that you can remove red eye/change the colours and edit the pictures on the camera itself/ outdoor pictures and portraits come out really well. it's compact and looks great. the viewing screen is huge, so you can review pictures easily.
it's small, fast to start up and is ready to take the next picture very quickly. only downside was the measly 32mb standard sd card.
compact, easy to use, good display screen
the product is amazing, picture quality is great and its so easy to use. its light and small and can fit into your pocket,and its got a 3 inch screen which i think is great! ...my first one got stolen and i had bought it last year, but i bought another one of the same because it was so satisfying!! the battery life is long too...!!!
brilliant camera, great design and build quality. takes excellent pictures and video
i already have a cannon ixus but an older model. this was purchased as a gift for my wife who found mine much easier to use than her older digital camera. the viewer screen is a good size and all round the camera seems much better than some on the market which have more features.
fantastic picture quality even when maximum zoom is used, large screen to view image and take photos.
massive screen
great screen, very compact, good battery life, fast for a compact camera.
hi iso for anti blur
large screen
pets setting on certain occassions to overcome shaky hands -- nice results!
zoom is amazing, and also being able to zoom into the pictures when they are displayed. giant screen is great, erasing is really easy, brilliant battery life, looks really really good!
easy to use, large screen with big clear instructions visable and easy to read. this camera is lightweight, good to look at and looks more expensive than it actually is, especially compared to the same model in silver/black. it's great value for money and the pictures are up to the standards of canons higher spec models. in camera red-eye correction is excellent and even works on childrena and animals eyes. whick are usually a problem when using flash.
good features
it's easy to use, and the quality of the pictures are really good.
great point and shoot cam for an beginers
video quality with low light
usual high quality canon camera with excellent picture quality. love the 3inch screen and clear display. carry the camera everywhere to catch the moment in a picture and use it to keep a record of jewellery i make! lots of good features that give versatility such higher iso setting or just put to auto and press the button.
a fantastic camera - the image quality is amazing, very impressed.
small size
quality product, it's perfect does exactly would you would expect from this manufacturer.

it's so easy to use. it's intuitive. i don't struggle to remember how to use it if i've not used it for a while. love it.

enlarge( within reason) without any real loss of image quality.
being able to switch from auto to features quickly, but...
very simple to use, with some funky features when you want them. easy to use as both a quality camera and a snapper. pretty good low-light performance. good battery life.
large and bright led screen
battery last for ages, auto focus is fab
also love the way the image rotates itself to correct position when viewing photos.
once the 'on' button has been pressed the camera is ready to take pictures in a matter of seconds, making it good for capturing every occassion. image quality is very good and the zoom effective. it also has some interesting effects that give pictures and added touch of variety.

this camera is absolutely wonderful.  my daughter had it first and i was so impressed i checked out all the reviews and saw how people raved about it so i bought one myself.  i can find no fault with it whatsoever.  the screen can get a bit greasy but that's not a problem.  it's a great little camera.

ease of use
this is an excellent camera with most of the features you'd find in a dslr, but at a size that fits in your pocket. image quality is outstanding and the ability to shoot in raw format gives you the ability to make more adjustments after shooting than you can with a camera that only shoots jpeg. if you're after a top-end compact camera this is definitely worth looking at.
the g9 is a very competent camera and produces very good recordings of the image taken. its slightly larger size and weight from other cameras allows for better control and handling and most of the controls fall easily to hand. 12 megapixels is impressive in its own right but the ability to join pictures in the supplied software allows for monster sized images to be produced.
sturdy and feeds comfortable in the hand. excellent lcd screen. able to shoot various file sizes including raw.
great image quality and excellent features.  the raw files are great but limited support available in imaging software as yet.  superb build quality.
its size, it has a lipo battery, a view finder and add on flash all that i wanted from this product
manual features that empower the photographer. solid build quality. raw enablement. great macro. sharp images with good light.
raw option, extensive manual control, great build quality
comfortable grip, exellent display, ease of use and downloading.
features and size
handling is superb access to dials and buttons is simple, the quality of build and look makes this camera a prise to own.
many options, good picture quality for a compact camera
i can't fault the camera
solid build and packed with features.  raw capture is the biggest bonus though.
has full manual control for those that want to think about taking photographs. a great compact compromise, you don't need an slr.  very good battery life, easy downloading.  full auto features for snap-happy moments (which i use a lot) but a pleasure to over ride when time, opportunity and subject permit.  some 'wow!' shots with the macro and i can't believe the stitching results.
excellent image quality, easy to get use to if familiar with slr controls, clear bright 'big' lcd display.
this is simply a first class camera for the user looking for a slightly more professional bit of kit than the average point and shoot machine. i've never been a huge fan of the viewing screens on digital cameras (preferring to use the eye viewfinder) but the quality of the one on this model is excellent and its size makes it easy to frame what you're shooting. i'm still getting to grips with all the facilities it offers but so far i'm delighted with the camera.
easy to use, clear large screen, sturdy and good handling. no fuss, no nonsense.
good battery life, quick power on time, good photos in varying conditions.
all good
for a compact digital camera it has to be the best outside bying an expensive slr. with 12mp whats there to grumble about. both my wife and myself have found it easy to use with it being user friendly from the off. need to learn a little more about some features but who doesnt when bying a new camera. we wanted the best of both world. a compact camera with the features and photos of an expensive larger slr. this ones a winner.
this camera has a wonderful macro at only 1cm from the subject. you can shoot in raw and manual. very unusual for a compact camera. it's very easy to use and feels substantial in your hands, not at all plasticy. if you use it on manual it gives you a very good rendition of what you were looking at. i bought this camera as i wanted one that i could carry around with me. i have two dslrs and they're too big for my handbag! :) i slip the strap over my grandson's head, put it on auto and off he goes. i also bought it for the macro. i do wedding photography and i wanted to use the macro on the g9 rather than change lenses on my cameras. i've been really pleases with the results.
incredible image quality  , a joy to use , and build quality that gives pride of ownership .even for the occasional photographer , you'll struggle to put it down . i don't think i'll ever tire of it . a little bit quicker and it'd be faultless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
there are too many good points to mention. each time i take it out to use i discover something new about the camera.
build, image quality, range of advanced easy to access features, large lcd, 6 x zoom. image stabilization. easy program shift feature by using exposure lock. great for serious photographers when you don't want to carry a lot of kit.
am disabled with the loss of my right arm and i find at i can use his camera without having problem's as long as i plan what i am going to shoot, i have taken some good sunset's and also some moveing shots ie horses in full gallop on the beach, i am realy happy with my camera and never leave the house without it, we live very close to the beech andthere is alway's somethig to snap
very easy to use and a great image
this is a sturdy camera.it has an excellent array of functions and settings including raw image files.
envied.
amazing build, excellent photos, great menu options.
excellent camera with a multitude of options...
ability to shoot raw
shoots in raw mode. supported by capture one raw workflow software. macro facility. can take filters if a lensmate adaptor is fitted. automatic iso mode to allow camera to bump up iso rating if shutter speed too slow.
excellent features, simple to use. nice clear lcd screen that is programmable as well.
its brilliant.
a robust camera with a host of quality features i still have to get to grips with; quick response times and raw capture.  it feels like carrying a 35mm leica with the same unobtrusive qualities, but excellent picture quality.
simple to use, fantastic lense with ois, bullet proof build, great interface an stunning image quality
good quality product with excellent picture quality, especially using raw files. complex features give it great potential if you understand them. good second camera to a dslr.

red eye removal excellent also to be able to change images to black and white and enhance colours is very clever a great little camera
further development of the excellent ixus range.  the modification to the picture review feature is very welcome indeed.
amazing picture quality for a compact, takes huge sdhc memory card, good battery life
well built apart from the cover for the usb port which is slightly difficult to use.
as good as it gets
quick start-up time
size. picture quality. weight
brilliant compact camera.  i bought it to replace an old cannon digital camera and i am very pleased with my new one.  the menu system is similar to the old camera so i found it really easy to find my way around.
sd card compatible
this camera is the best i have ever had! image quality is absolutely superb. it is easy to use and feels sturdy. i bought this camera 3 days before going on a big holiday. i learnt how to use it the night before i went and the end results (540 pictures) were fantastic. i took fireworks pictures, low light, glare from the sun etc. and really used the camera to test its ability.
white features
picture quality is excellent, numerous shooting modes help get the best shot, even in a ordinarily lit room at night ist possible to get noise free shots with decent colour.  panormic mode is easy, with a line electronically displayed on the screeen showing where the join will be!
very simple to use, features adequate for my use as a very amateur photographer. easy access to features. love my camera look forward to learn as much as i can about all the features.
good first time slr with excellent quality of image.also a good range of additional accessories which are compatable.
very good price, easy to use. a good camera to try as a first slr digital camera.
quality.
great if you already have a canon slr and want to convert to digital
excellent performance generally, image quality very high, many good features and versatility, as small and light as could reasonably be expected.  battery life is amazing and spare batteries cheap.
compact,light and yet with all the features of a much bigger camera
excellent easy to use quality digital slr with interchangeable lens capability
very quick start up.  the most frequently used features eg. iso setting, metering and white balance have short cut button so that you don't have to scroll through the menu to change them.  good ergonomics - it fits nicely in the hand.  simple to use - it can be used straight out of the box.  battery life is excellent.
instant on - no descernible shutter lag. best spec. for the money at this time.
the canon 350d is a superb camera offering excellent photographs. the clarity is beyond any other camera i have found for the price, it is also very easy to use in full auto mode but can be set up to be used by a more expeienced photograher.
the image quality is supurb and with the different modes you can experiment and improve your technique and results.
image quality is excellent,even set on high iso the noise is very low. lighweight easy to use and good value for money
easy to use lightweight camera with good quality images
professional pictures even when enlarged to huge sizes. prints are fantastic. features easy to understand. download is easy and very sensible.
compatibility wit older lenses
programmes are fairly intuitive and provides plenty of scope for the serious amateur - i use this camera mainly for recording building work/defects in connection with my work
brilliant digital slr at very good price, makes it very easy for anyone to enter the world of semi profesional photography at a realistic price.
excellent value for money, image quality outstanding for a camera of this price bracket.
light weight and easy to use and the software is useful and easy to use.
great camera for a slr virgin like myself, easy to use and nice to hold
compact, easy to use on automatic and plenty of facilities for the more adventurous photographers who wish to be creative.
the product takes superb pictures
so easy to use, you can just pick it up and start shooting excellent quality pictures!
top-notch camera. professional looking photos. easy to use and to edit.
raw conversion software comes free.
just want to point and snap and be confident of getting great quality pictures? this cameras got it. want to delve a little deeper and control the picture taking process? this cameras got it.
excellent image quality and night time mode
my first digital slr: ease of use was surprisingly good - produced excellent results within an hour of opening the box
a great piece of kit. easy to use and good value for money
easy to use in fully automatic mode
although i have heard negative feedback on the size of the camera, i personally find it a good and light camera to use.
an excelent camera, image quality and colour reproduction are spot on, start up speed is very fast.
great camera, picture quality is superb.  easy to use
brilliant entry-level dslr.
very intuitive. good ergonomics.
as a fond and long-standing owner of conventional canons (ae1 and eos), the 350d is very familiar in look and feel, and confidence inspiring as a result - but lighter and digital, with all the associated benefits
the camera was intuitively easy to set up and operate.
the s.l.r iin it field
hard to take a bad photo
superb quality images
perfect digital quality pictures.
needs very little 'head in the book' time very well laid out and intuitive menu design and controls.
great in auto made and in program mode , easy to hold and use
ease of use, intuitive controls and menu.
very easy to use and a wonderfull image depth and quality.

easy to use for a non-photographer.  good quality pictures
excellent entry level digital slr.
picture quality, robust design, many extras that are easily purchased.
aperture for some shots.
easy to use, our first digital slr and an easy step from our cannon eos 35mm which we had for 12 years
easy to handle
excellent package with a good all round lens for a starter kit in slr
small and light.  copes well with difficult exposures.
size and weight
- sturdy build and the body looks nice
lots of settings to play with and lots to discover.
the slr combined with a 2gb memory card lets you take endless photographs wihch means even a hopeless photographer can end up with professional looking images.
excellent, easy to use camera that feels good to hold and takes great pictures.
as it says on the box.
even i, as a complete camera numpty, can use it.
great quality camera; can be used at any level of competency; battery life excellent; can't really see that i would ever want another camera after this; ability to use some previous usm lenses i had was a real bonus.
excellent for the use we put it to. good clear returns. very easy to handle and a very good entry point camera.
excellent features covering just about everything that i required, including mirror lock-up and an lcd lamp.
this is a beautiful camera to use. i've had a good digital camera before but this is in a different league. on automatic it's as simple as the point and shoot instants but with an assurance that the image you get will be exactly the one you want. and now that i'm getting more confident i'm finding the features such as white balance and independent control of the shutter and aperture interesting to play with.
compact body lends it to my requirements for a slr that i can conveniently carry around
great at everything i fling at it.
lightweight without feeling cheap and nasty. good build ane excellent performance. auto facility very impressive in low light conditions
good features, feelssolid but light
the picture qualitiy from this camera is superb. auto focusing is easy as a point and shoot camera but withe the other features makes a picture perfect
everything really.
menu system
great price, i dont think you could do better for the money. very good image quality and extremely easy to use.
easy to use slr, nice build design and features
simple to use, and very good quality pictures
all my old lenses from my original canon slr fit!
battery seems to have a good life.
good slr takes good pictures easy features even for the beginer
excellent compact camera, ultimate quality, value for money.
excellent build quality, good features, well placed on the body, especially for those with big hands.  takes fantasic photographs, even in low light.
quickness of taking pictures
compact, relatively easy to use if familiar with canon family, great value. interchangeability of ef lens
the price i paid was great for a semi-profesional camera.
excellent high quality dslr camera at very reasonable price
too many to mention
features.
lightweight, logical systems, compact
value for money and good results
easy to use and not too heavy.  good picture quality and easy adjustable lens.
the speed with which this camera starts up is very impressive. it is very easy to download the images using photoshop elements and the quality of the pictures compared to my last camera (canon g5) bears no comparison.
as a non-slr user, easy to use straight out of the box in auto or semi-auto modes, excellent build quality for the price.
it is so easy to use.
all round soundness of the camera
excellent all-round performer, allowing the novice to produce professional results
easy to use, easy to handle, good quality results
light, compact and easy to use
excellent camera, easy to use, great quality of pictures.
it,s easy to use, although i'm still learning but it's fun as well. i love it and think it's brilliant and would recommend it to anyone.
a superb quality camera which encourages the transition from point and shoot to creative photography.
quality dslr camera at afforadable price, host of features to learn and enjoy. interchangeable lenses=versatility
the camera is excellent but the memory card was corrupted from day one - very poor piece of equipment
a good, easy to use, camera with plenty of options and consistently good results
it does what i expected of it!
very comfortable in the hand with easy menu.
all required items and software was supplied.
small compact for an slr
flexible meeting most requirements
excellent quality camera at very good price
easy to use. good quality digital camera.
great lens, excellent features, good build quality.
a very good camera, fits perfectly in my hand, and easy to use. manage to get some really nice pictures.
fast start up time and next to no shutter delay. good battery life.
fun to use. instantly see what has been shot comprehensive instructions.
prints direct from memory card are good.
fast operation with no delay. small size and low weight. high quality raw images.
excellent all round camera
available extras i.e lenses
ease of use
very easy to use, great image quality and good that all canon lenses can be used with camera
like my old film slr but even better.
great photos and settings
excellent picture quality easy to use.
lens quality good
great all rounder - excellent pics with 20x optical zoom and hd movies. multiple pre-set settings for various shooting conditions.
wanted a camera that would be a compact but also give me quality pictures like a slr.  this camera does it all :)... don't get me wrong it's not a nikon d90 or a canon eos 50d, but saying that the functions are well balanced and take's great photo's..  now i have had one, wouldn't swap it for a d90 or a 50d...  maybe a canon 7d or 5d mark2....  /dream
very flexible camera, good telephoto ability - just come back from safari - camera was excellent to get some good close up shots
great range of useful features plus the fantastic 20x zoom with is that works well for me.
lots of great features such as panaroma and colour swap give you the opportunity to experiment.
-good accurate colour balance sensors and light detection sensors
unique feature set, fantastic zoom range, handles almost like a slr,. excellent ergonomics, fast processor, good looks (similar to canon eos cameras), decent build quality. a true hybrid device (camcorder/photo camera).
very good at focusing at distance, still have a lot to learn as there is a lot to understand to gain full use of camera
easy to operate
the camera is of the high standard and quality you expect from canon giving excellent results.  being a bridge camera it is just what i wanted with slr facilities but not the need to keep changing lens for different situations.  i would highly recommend this camera to anybody who is looking for more than an ordinary compact but not wanting a full blown slr.  in short it is solidly built good quality canon camera with lots of scope for the beginner to advance with.
hdmi is fantastic.
excellent quality camera, gives lovely pics and easy to use.
good build quality and image quality
feels good and solid, and easy to pick up the basics. even for a complete novice like me.
i have not had much time to use it yet but so far it seems extremely good.
excellent camera overall...................
easy to use with excellent picture quality . the moveable preview screen is very handy
easy to use and very intuitive.
excellent image quality.   excellent build quality.   compact and comfortable to hold.   controls are intuitive and considering the range of features are the best i have experienced.   face recognition is effective and very useful
small, light and pocket size. good quality photos can be achieved. it is great as a point and shoot but also has manual settings for more advanced use.
build,battery life,image quality
solid and robust. brilliant quality photos, very quick off to ready time.
overall i am extremely pleased with this little gem, and feel it was well worth the effort of researching the market.  and worth the effort of reading the 170 page user guide.  if you want a lot more than a snap-shot camera, download the ixus 980 is full specification and get ready for some real enjoyment!
small good to put in pocket
there are numerous good points.  the camera is feature packed and spec'd to a level which you'd expect to find in a dslr.  the pre-programmable print button is great feature for assigning various options (i've assigned mine for one touch manual white balance control- great for vivid underwater shots [although the scene underwater mode is also excellent]).  the battery life is great, build quality superb and image quality fantastic.  having just returned from a diving trip to scapa flow (orkney's) i now have a sdhc card with over 300 high res images both on land and underwater.  it'll be a struggle to decide which ones to print, as there are many gems!  these cameras are a must for any diver wanting to purchase a camera with manual white balance control, without running to the expense of a dslr.  the camera is a doddle to operate and the supplied software allows for a good degree of post image editing.....not that you should really need to with this camera in your pocket!  for those wishing for a similar spec but with a large zoom i'd suggest the g10, which has the same number of features but comes with a larger zoom lens.
handy size that packs in a good file size, easy to slip int your pocket.
the camera is a little chunkier than the ixus 55 but you hardly notice it due to the overall quality of the product. definitely well worth buying this camera. i spent ages researching this item and found it to be a lot cheaper on this website.
excellent image quality, even in low light conditions. the 'auto' setting is adequate for pretty well any conditions or situations that i have so-far encountered. it's very useful to have a viewfinder, an item that is beginning to disappear from digital cameras. the movie-clip quality is very high, including the sound. in an editing suite it's almost impossible to distinguish between the video from the ixus and the video from my sony handycam. the camera is very small and light and an underwater housing is available for scuba.
very neat and compact mid-price camera with a good feel in the hand. small enough to carry around easily. gd lcd quality. still v new so haven't had a chance to explore all the features.
hi res, nice handling
great auto feature where you can point n take resolution makes even paper prints are excellent quality
great compact camera that has it all!
size. manual controls
very high build quality, easy to use, great camera for the price.
very small and light. sharp lens and high pixel count are adequate for selective enlargements. a4 prints are sharp edge to edge, a3 prints are pixel free. manual (etc) options make it very flexible for creative shots. feels well made. surprisingly good flash coverage. joy of joys, it has a viewfinder.
this camera has lots of features, we particularly like the colour accent setting. the picture quality is very good and easy to take good pictures.
image quality above all, great build quality, excellent features
amazing camera. so easy to use and great pictures.
viewfinder, and predictive focussing.
image quality. loads of features.
small neat simple to use and fits in my pocket.
image quility, especially in low light. optical viewfinder. manual settings
all in all a very good point and shoot camera but with all the features of a 35mm camera you can do just about anything with all of the settings
it had so many good points it is difficult to pick out just one or two.   i certainly found many things that i didn't have on my other digital camera which gave me a much wider menu to pick from, also the number of pixels which i can now control and use less if i want to. .
i have just downloaded the first images off it. i have to say they are excellent.i have found it easy to use.but so far have only used the automatic function.
excellent product. although i have larked 'ease of use' down, the only reaon for this is that as it has leading features in 'manual' mode that require learning, it would naturally not be as simple to use in this mode as other 'just auto' camers. that said, in manual mode, it's excellent.
light, small and should be easy to use once mastered.
the macro was brilliant, very easy to check live focus, it will be great for small criters like the pigmy sea horses and nudibranch.
build quality
all what i need fron a point and shoot
manual white balance
very easy to use as point and shoot but with plenty of manual control if wanted. great zoom, cd quality  sound on video, zoom works in video mode and is very quiet, not picked up on the sountrack of any i have shot. viewfinder adequate for setting up shots with all the information you need. swivel screen makes taking shots above or below eye level easy. although video is not hd it looks great on 32'' hd screen.
speed of start-up, colour balance, quality of image, range of settings, ease of use, image viewer, zoom
simple to use, stunning zoom. use an sdhc ultra iii and airshows are easy
it is excellent for taking architectural features on buildings, even when they are at the top of spires/towers.
easy to use good over long distance without having to change lenses the automatic lens does it all for you. for someone who wants good quality pictures without the difficult technology that some cameras have, this is easy to use and great quality for the money
the flip out screen is really useful (especially for short people to look over others or round corners!).  there is a wide variety of settings.  because of the aa batteries it is quite heavy but it does mean you can change the batteries in the middle of the day!
why carry the extra weight and bulk when this has 95% of an slr's capabilities.
easy automatic or creative manual control. smaller than a dslr but almost as capable. superb image quality.uses standard aa batteries.
simple to use
best camera for the money in its range.
good solid slr replacement for occasional photographers with video and stereo sound.
time lapse.
cracking lens and image quality - sharp, natural colours.
i bought this as an update for the sx1is as i had found this to be a great camera but it has sadly gone wrong. the update to 20x optical zoome is amazing. i find the camera easy to use as separate dials/buttons do different things rather than having to trawl through a menu on a single control. it feels sturdy in the hands and makes photography comparable to my old film slr but with the bonus that you don;t have to worry about wasting film.
why buy a dslr !
as soon as you pick the product up you can feel the quality and when you come to use it you realise that feeling was correct
one lens instead of 3.    easy to carry and use.
has hot shoe for flash
terrific camera....the super zoom with image stablisation is great. i like the bigger feel of the camera and this suits me. with a little knowledge, you can achieve almost anything that you want
well made and easy to use on auto. fantastic lens and fantastic anti shake feature. good stereo sound. feels good in the hand. my best camera so far.
shot modes produce excellent results with little or no effort.  intelligent face recognition that follows your face, multi af settings galore, the list goes on and on.  the colours it produces are vibrant and realistic and in low light it does a decent job even at long focal lengths.  if you're brave, you can set this baby into full manual and configure everything to your heart's content.  i think the best mode is 'program mode'.  you can also attach a standard flash beam or additional lenses/filters. this camera is almost slr quality but for digital camera money.  have i mentioned it does wide-screen photos too?
well-designed and easy to handle with good locations for the controls.
did everything expected and more, first rate.
everything
low price.
takes pictures very quickly and easily, picture quality and zoom outstanding.
build quality is excellent, the lcd screen is large and clear plus it is still clearly visible even in the sunlight. the different scene settings give plenty of flexibility.
i bought this cam to replace my sony p72 in preparation for a visit to florida. the camera is easy to use when set on automatic and it copes well with most situations. image when fully zoomed was much better than expected. battery life is excellent and the flash seems upto most tasks. the movie feature is good, allowing editing which was not available on my last cam, would have prefered mpg instead of mov format. the cam is ready for action quickly, much faster than my old sony. it's also fairly robust (it has been dropped a few times). the face detection mode waits for you to join the photo, by counting the faces then waiting for one more, it actually works !
very good product.
a good all rounder.
large screen, plenty of features
quite easy to understand  - still working on the advanced features!
easy to hold. excellent results. compact size

great picture quality for a compact camera. short shutter lag.
it's brilliant. easy to use, fantastic picture quality, everything you need
fairly robust and a good size. great pictures. useful manual settings.
as with all ixus cameras the operating system is very intuitive. on camera editing is very useful and the colour accent is a nifty little feature. battery life is amazing!
great image quality, usual quality canon build. large display (useful as you get older!).
robust build. compact size and excellent picture quality
all is very good
it does what it says - even my wife finds it easy
wonderful photographic reproduction. easy to use. easy to slip into a pocket. it does everything i wanted from a digital camera.
in auto mode just point and shoot
some really cool features and things to play around with.
image quality, size
probably as good as a compact digital gets. very simple for point-and-shoot yet with enough features to provide extensive manual control.
it is a good point and shoot camera that i got as a gift for my sister as she takes lots of photos of her little one and she has been extremely happy with it. it also allows her to take good quality, short video clips.
the camera is very intuitive to use if you don't want to read the manual.. but reading the manual has enhanced my experience.. still a lot more to read, but already getting fantastic results. would recommend the camera to anyone and i am soooo pleased i bought it.
small but easy to handle.  good image quality even when straying into digital zoom.  wide angle lens allows close up photographs.
easy to use, good to look at. good battery life.
very quick from switching the camera on to taking a picture. picture quality excellent and colours really strong. really good at doing close up photos
as a novice photographer with the will to learn and improve i found this camera very good and have already taken a vast variety of photographs using all gadgets, focal length light  and choice of lense.
excellent pictures with low light.  battery life good.  choice of 18-55mm and 75-300mm lenses gives a good range which should suit most applications.
good introduction to slr photography
it is reccomended as a good camera for a first time user of slr. it certainly lives up to its billing . so  far i have  really enjoyed using it and been able to take some very good wildlife shots
ideal camera for a beginner... straight forward and easy to use... some cool little features
camera very easy to use.  documentation is superb and easily understandable.  pictures taken are really high quality both for portraits and landscapes.  i have used canon products before and this purchase does not disappoint.
easy to use for a non-expert, and the 2 lenses cover most needs.
it's fairly light, however be aware that when you put the larger lenses on it can get pretty heavy if your using it for a long time without a tripod.
very good deal with the lens kits and bag
offers good facilities for the price and can form the basis of your entry into digital photography.
simple to use
image quality is just great, much better than i expected. really am impressed. video is amazing too. very light weight, i carry mine in shirt pocket it`s so small. battery life is ok, altho i`d recomend carrying a spare as back up. start up time for first shot is very quick.
simple to use in auto mode, spend time exploring the features and be even more amazed what this little camera can do. i bought it to use at a friends wedding and got some fantastic pics, i used it for about 14 hours taking pictures and recording hd videos on the day and the battery ran out when it was time to leave the wedding party. i viewed the pictures and videos on the telly and was really impressed! all in all, if you want a small camera that does so much and record hd videos with great functions and ease of, i would thoughly recommend this camera.
nothing was straight). image quality is fine for a camera of it's size. it's not amazing quality compared to the 90is or something bigger, but for an ultra compact with this many features i don't think you could get much better.
great little camera. i was almost going to get the cybershot but this cannon takes much better quality pictures when printed. it's very little, so perfect for the pocket or handbag. i only use the auto setting, but will aim to investigate the manual settings as i think i could take some great shots manually.
video quality are amazing compared to my last sony camera.
love the colour accent feature - you can select a colour that stays and the rest goes black and white! also fab macro images. i love this camera!!!!!
light camera at a good price. this is easy to use once you understand the available settings.
it's tiny! can easily fit in the same pocket as my phone. it has intelligent auto so is great as a capture anything point and shoot
size.auto/manual settings.high megapixals.quick start-up
small compact and easy to use but delivers very good results.
love it love it, very crisp photos and all the photos come out very good. the design is so sleek and mine (red) is a great colour to have, its easier to see the buttons in the red colour than say, the gold one.
excellant value camera - easy to use
delivery and service excellent.
it is a fab little camera - it takes excellent photo's,it is really wasy to use and looks great. it also has an optical view finder which is good if you are wanting to save battery power.

i found the camera easy to use with the basic controls comfortable to manage. i have been particularly impressed with the hd video quality.
very small, large lcd size, quick to save images.
optical viewfinder.
5) i bought it for someone else and deliberately went for as few buttons as possible. however, there are a very useful set of shooting modes available.
very compact, perfect for slipping in pocket  or bag. looks smart, takes great pictures. very little camera shake, but if it's a problem just use kids and pets setting. my last camera was a canon ixus 70 which was brilliant but died due to water damage, and was pleased that not only were the controls and menus very similar, but the batteries were identical, so i already have a spare. haven't printed any photos yet, but they look great on screen.
has all the features of my previous ixus cameras plus some extra. the hd video is great and saves the need for a camcorder and although its not full 1080 hd (720 i think) can anyone actually tell the difference anyway?!
brilliant picture quality have an earlier model,  also slimmer in size is great for putting in handbag took it to las vegas at new year it performed better than expected night and day with auto focus and hardly any shuddering on all pictures
small, quality shots, easy to use

i love this camera, it is small, compact and easy to use. i also decided to get this one as it had an optical view finder, which is now disappearing from most digial cameras!!
small enough to fit easily in your pocket. great to have a veiw finder as well as a display.
bought for my husband and he's been very pleased with it so far. he keeps telling me he's found more features - he didn't spend much time reading the manual when he got it! i couldn't believe how small it is. the view finder is very small too, but seems to line up well. recommended.
fantastic camera, very small size, takes great pictures during a day and at night
a neat little camera that does all it says on the box
excellent small compact camera,brilliant video and sound. why buy a video camera when this one gives good results,software easy to use,the extra viewfinder is a boon on very sunny days.best digital camera i have ever purchased.

compact good screen optical viewfinder
all round good performance
it's really easy to use and has great picture and sound quality
excellent results, easy to navigate menu
eye piece viewfinder as well as screen which avoids problem of bright sunlight on screen when using. good zoom. good battery life. lightweight and easy to carry in a pocket.
packs so much into a small package. selling point for me was that a viewfinder is included, rare on tadays cameras. vey useful in bright sunlight when screen is hard to use.
battery life
great product for the money. ideal just to slip into pocket when out and about. image quality is excellent as is flash performance indoors. highly recommended for those who want a camera for parties / nights out and for those who always like to have a camera with them but don't want the bulk of a digital slr
outstanding quality pictures and hi-def video. very quick to turn up - no delay taking photos (never miss a special moment!). hd video recording is amazing - better than having a camcorder at 720p resolution. the thinnest camera i have seen with these features - slips into jeans pockets with ease. recommend getting a genuine canon case and a large sd card (minimum 8gb)
packed full of features. images are of a very high quality. camera itself looks classy. very small in size but with an good sized lcd screen
really nice and sleek, lots of features crammed, great for photos for events etc
small, lightweight, large viewer, there's also a viewfinder for seeing subjects in bright light, great canon lens quality.
i have adapted a belt pouch so i carry it with me all the time, even in work.
quality of shots on automatic mode is brilliant. it is particularly good indoors and with portraits. the camera is stylish and attracts admiration. it has a viewfinder - a feature you don't usually get with such cameras.
size, picture quality and ease of use
compact.
small and easy to use.
then this camera must be considered.
excellnet compact camera - i love it!
lots of automatic features that constantly adjust the settings for you (all you notice is the icons in the corner).
the battery life is brilliant on it too - i have used it allot and only had to recharge once in the last 3 weeks.
it's a very good balance between size/zoom/other features and easy to carry around unobtrusively.
easy to use, small for convenience, pictures are  very good quality
compact and well designed
easy to use, compact size, image quality.
image very clear and sharp
this camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures.
great picture, fully auto for those who dont know how to operate a camera. decent enough video footage to get rid of exsisting camcorder.
canon ixus 100 is isso far, all that i require for my standard of photography.
image quality is really good outside especially the colors. really nice design! overall a really fine pocket camera!
it's easy to use, it takes fantastic pictures and it's a really nice design.
good looking and easy to hold.  can take this camera everywhere.

size and weight
i bought this for underwater use and the ease of use and access to controls is excellent.  picture quality is amazing compared with my previous olympus muji.
exellent point and shoot compact amazing how much in so little camera
a neat compact little camera that doesn't have too many features to make it complicated. great if you want a camera for taking holiday snaps that fits in your pocket.
it was very simple  for me to use as i'm not a professional photographer.
good small easy to use camera.
quality of the lens and photos produced. number of pixels. size  - amazingly small
compact, good picture quality for a small camera
great size, ease of use, good amount of features. a bargain!
small .... very portable... tons of features...
good quality pictures
very light compact camera. whilst it is not canon's latest model, on average it produces excellent quality photos
this is a great go-anywhere camera. superbly portable and wonderful images - including reduced light. i have used it every day for 3 weeks on holiday and the battery was still almost full - after over 160 images. an excellent buy.
excellent all round camera for any type of user. nice small size and a really crisp picture.
simple to use
it takes good quality photos and videos, plus it has loads of useful features like rotating pictures.
takes great photo's very easy to use.
fantastic camera, amazing video, best digital camera in its price rage and higher well happy with this buy :)
compact.
will also record video in hd.
ideal for slipping into handbag or pocket, no bulk. being a 'point and shoot' user it is very easy, however i have been tempted to experiment a little. having a viewfinder was really important for me as i have difficulty with the screen when it is sunny. so far i am delighted with the camera.
easy to carry.tele photo good.quality and photos very good.
compact, light weight. has auto iso, hd video. for the amateur and as a tourist photography.
great pictures, very compact and easy to carry.
very compact and all in all takes a great photo.
takes very good and fast photo's, perfect for my wife storing it in her handbag ready to take pics of the kids at the drop of a hat. if you are expecting a camera with slr like zoom etc then this won't be what you need, if however you want a good solid camera for taking quick photo's and that gives a good picture and is very compact then this one will fit the bill. filled with good and well thought out features that some at twice the price struggle to have, excellent picture quality for such a small camera. it takes loads of photo's on one battery charge. all in all a good buy. i'd say the best camera in its range
value for money
the fact it is so small means you can pop it in your pocket and carry it around a;ll the time so i find myself taking much more pictures that i did with my old compact camera.
all round performance
cute and easy to use. can pop it into my bag and take it everywhere
its very small for carrying around. takes good pictures but havent used it enough to comment further
small, extremely portable yet still takes lovely pictures and preserves the manual settings that i love about canon cameras.
sleek design.

very good image quality, strong and nice build
small, good battery life, easy to use, great video, fast power up.
size and ease of use
very compact with reasonable battery life and takes a decent picture. has a view finder as well for sunny days on the ski slopes!
amazingly there are very few compact cameras now available with viewfinders. anyone who has tried to take pictures outdoors cannot usually compose their picture without, even with additional shields (have noticed even canon is stopping this feature-which is stupid). camera neat and compact. not yet had a lot of use but have taken both still and video.
great for travelling.  fits into any pocket
very little delay on shutter
great screen - no need for viewfinder after all.
living in malta with bright sunlight all year round, i needed a good camera with an optical viewfinder. this is the best i found in the category and the price range i was seeking.

the camera is very handy, easy to use. i use it as a second camera to my dslr. i don't always have the dslr on me but the ixus 100 is always in my pocket ready to shoot and i love it. i can take pictures whenever i need to and the quality is very good and it also features hd movies which is pretty impressive.
i like the fact that it has a viewfinder.  i don't need to put my reading glasses on to take a picture and if it is very bright the screen is sometimes difficult to see.  lovely photos particularly if subject is moving.  i took some great photos of my grand daughter jumping in the water on holiday.
excellent picture quality and small enough for even my small handbags. very easy for point and shoot use, but the programmable mode will take longer to master.
very compact, simple to operate, having a viewfinder, good size screen

controls very easy to use.  on screen menu self explanatory.  large display screen.  zoom control incredibly easy to operate.  picks out faces and shows green box around the central focussing element.  by moving the camera slightly, you can change where the camera focuses.  excellent battery life.  can see on screen how many shots you have left.  instruction book very easy to understand.  auto setting makes point and shoot very simple and produces excellent results.
size, image quality and robustness of build.

moderately-priced for entry into professional photography.
fantastic camera. very fast.i love it.feels like a 'real' camera, very solid construction.
the programed night mode is brilliant had great success with it. the autofocus system seams to lock on and give great pictures every time even in quick snap mode picking birds out of a leafless tree.well pleased with this camera.
it is just a great camera,
this product has excellent scope with numerous features and optional accessories for producing high quality exposures of a wide array of different style of various subjects.
overall i am very happy with this camera.
lovely camera to use. great images with my 24-85. nice to have a proper camera again.
easy to use, good quality pictures. similar feel and design to f80.
a typical nikon - good solid feel and produces excellent quality output. the large screen makes reviewing images a breeze. mac users, get the nikon raw converter for aperture, plug in and go.
high spec and good build quality. it has a good array of features and the controls are easy to find. comprehensive menu which is easy to navigate. the camera feels substantial in the hands without feeling bulky.
solid build, great image quality, spot metering, 10 mp, very easy to use.
the nikon d80 is a brilliant camera, in a hour or so it seems like you have owned it for years it is so easy to use, the image quality is very good.
very fast focus-tracking ability comparing to canon 350d. very good handling and clear menu.
handling is excellent, all function buttons are at fingertips.  in camera menus are simple to configure.
far better features and pictures than nikon d100.
fast and reliable workhorse, good battery life and extensive features makes the eos30d a joy to use.
as i expected from nikon the camera is very good.  as it is my only camera it fits with my ability, and what i was prepared to spend. i also purchased a 18-200 vr lens to go with the camera.
any hesitation to move from film to digital is blown away by this camera.
a well put together camera with superb picture quality, excellent features and very easy to use.
picture quality.  robust build.  speed of response.  lcd monochrome panel useful in bright light where the colour display is harder to see.
serious camera combines sophisticated slr with powerful digital processing. handles well, copes with everything from point and shoot to creative work.
chunky, robust and high quality camera, easy to hold and use. we've got the ultra-wide angle lens fitted as an option, and the panorama shots are truly impressive. large lcd screen for reviewing images, all the controls fall neatly to hand, and for the price, you get a lot of pixels for your money.
big solid build.  plenty of camera to hold onto if one has large hands. very user friendly.  very good quality pictures.
as you would expect with anything canon it's fantastic, the build quality is spot on, no loose bits or things that just dont quite work. mines been through the sahara desert, and always continues to do exactly what it says on the box.
great camera. delighted
this is a great camera with excellence image quality and very simple to use, its also has a very large screen which with zoom and crop image features
among us. the ability to manipulate shots  after taking them  allows for errors when using non cpu lens.
it's a nikon product which gives it a flying start. layout and function are familiar from d50 experience. 10 mpixel resolution is just right for my purposes to enable cropping of images and still be able achieve good sized prints. it has more facilities (d-lighting, extra focus points, etc.) than my previous d50 - with which i was very pleased.
brilliant clear photos
good size display, excellent image quality, the overall weight and feel of the camera lets you know you are holding a good quality slr. in automatic mode a child could not fail to take a decent picture.
everything about this body is fantastic!
very high quality of equipment.
very fast, easy to navigate menu, buttons in the right places, quality feel
the software suite with the camera is also very good although it isn't a photoshop.
great camera excellent image quality
contains a lot of the features of the more expensive d200 without the extra bulk of that camera.  as light and portable as the d50 but with more quality and advanced features.
a great digital slr camera with superb image quality and easy to use features. this allows me to get use out of my various lens originally used for 35mm with good quality printing upto to a3.
slightly expensive, but still the best of its type
awsome for digital picture quality even hand held. head and shoulders above any other camera i have ever used.
straight forward to use. lightweight compared to a d200
image quality and easy to use menu.
a good range of extra lenses is available which i am sure i'll get into at some point in the future.
it's a professional camera, it takes professional pictures. it has a good solid feel. it does low light shots very well.
very easy for an idiot like me to pick up and use with hardly any expireance of using a digital slr before.
the eos 30d is very well built and the images are excellent.
solid build quality
great for the new digital slr user and also for the vetern
build quality, ease of use.
although i am a beginner it is very easy to use out of the box with automatic functions to sort every need.  there is a wealth of functions avaliable on this camera which means you have a wealth of new things to try when you move over to various manual modes.
image quality.
well made solid feel, confortable to hold. excellent image quality, brings out lots of detail. menu and menu access is easy, all buttons seem well thought out and fall to hand easily. viewfinder is extrememly good, as id the large colourful rear display. the camera is on and ready to use instantly.
handles nicely, well balanced with my 28-200 nikon zoom.
continues the nikon quality and performance
it's quite a flexible camera.
great handling camera with plenty of great features for the discerning amatuer. fantastic high iso performance and image quality. the kit lens is an ok starter lens but to take advantage of the fantastic cmos sensor, quality glass is recommended. i have the ef-s 17-55 f2.8 is and ef 70-200 f4 is which are ideal companions for walkabout. i also have some specialist primes for more creative shots. that's the big advantage of d-slr
large lcd, comfortable solid handling and super-quick ai-servo focusing
ergornomic to use, all round performer for the money
very fast (compared to my old 300d), large buffer so can run off a long series of shots.
exposure using flash excellent. easy to use. solid build quality. good lense in package for price and image stabilizer works well.
ease of use, battery life, image quality
excellent all round camera.
my previous camera was a d70 and the transition was very easy.  really pleased with it - so far no bad points.  excellent build quality.  very pleased to have made the upgrade.
excellent advances in technology and useability.
ease of use of the many menus.  once familiarised, the speed with which one can navigate through the multitude of options is outstanding
easy to use for normal shooting, even better pictures than the 300d that it replaced.
excellent camera, especially when twinned with a good lens.
ease of use and build quality
auto focus is superb
i was recommended to buy this camera by my tutors at college where i am a mature student.  i do not regret my purchase at all.  the 30d gives me a great deal of scope in photographic terms to do everything i want.
speed, battery life, quality of build and images
solid feel, very easy to use and excellent picture qualities. many in-camera features, e.g. for image manipulation. this is my first dslr and so far teh experience has been everything i could have hoped for.
reputation for robustness
comfortable in the hand, solid construction no body movement under pressure
shoot to total manual control.covers just about everything the serious slr user will ever require. excellent lcd screen.if you're upgrading from a previous autofocus nikon, existing lenses are interchangeable.
easy to use,controls easy at hand,feels good in the hand.
great features, a good camera for serious amateurs.

everything
easy access to facilities.  good metering and a very good lens.
easy to use by a novice and a handy second hand camera for a dslr user. lots of manual control facilities for a pro user. bright, accurate and large display - have not needed a view finder yet.
love it! better than i was expecting. it takes a while to get use to the way it works but am really enjoying it and have no regrets of buying it.  have recommended it to friends
an excellent camera for those considering a compact camera to compliment their slr, or someone wanting to experiment with more creative shooting modes (manual, aperture priority etc).
this is simply the best compact i have owned. i bought this as a companion to my dslr and for shooting when i don't want to carry a lot of equipment.
a digital camera with a high specification. it is small and compact so can replace a dslr when it is not convenient to carry a heavy and larger camera. it produces pictures equaly as good  as a dslr of similar specification and will even take raw pictures which is certainly a plus for the experienced amateur. although there is no view finder this is no disadvantage except in very strong sunlight. however the ldc screen is quite bright and works quite well in framing a shot. the zoom range is limited but easily controlled with the large ring around the lens.
great camera. for a small compact it takes fantastic quality pictures. really, there is little you can't love about this camera.
good size
i like it very much... because it is light compare to g11/g10. it captures nice images..(it is good it focusing/sharp images) if you want a light camera ... this is for you.
it also means i can now carry a camera everywhere i go.
compact, good manual settings, good photos.
fantastic camera, even better than expected.  bought to replace a powershot s60 and very impressed by how much better it is - very compact, big screen, no red eye ever, great night time pics, vastly improved battery life etc.  strongly recommend.
low light performance, size, raw, image quality for compact.
everything
very good performance under low light conditions
image quality is good bearing in mind this is a compact camera.  it is very compact and easily carried in a shirt pocket.  battery life is good.  low light level image quality is good , iso 800 pictures are quite acceptable.  makes a good second camera to partner a dslr.
type pictures. it just needs time to familiarise oneself on all the features and how they work.
lots of features, good picture quality, hd movies, facility for external flashgun if needed.  generally a good compromise between a full slr and a compact.
seems a good solid camera - so far i'm very pleased with it.
easy to use software for transferring images from the camera to your computer.
easy to use with the auto feature and i find being a novice that i can understand the info in most of the guide of 180 pages. it is a chalenge for me but am enjoing the experience of learning about an exellent product by canon.
excellent set of control features, easy to use massive zoom
image stabilisation is excellent, making the full zoom usable out of hand without necessarily needing a tripod.  it suses aa batteries rather than a dedicated lithium cell and while this can be a bad point for some it is a benefit to me.
every thing  seems to be at hand for me i have artheritus in both hands and it has not stoped me from taking som exl photies
telescopic option combined with anti shake gets some great close ups of wild life.
easy to handle and good features
nice campact camera,long zoom close up feature excellent not had a great deal of time to put it through its paces yet
handy, easy to use. powerful zoom.
easy to use, and achieve good quality photo's, even for amatures.
easy to use.stylist,eye catching,lovely camera.
well built camera from a well known brand.
light, good manual, great zoom focus
camera takes great pictures and great video.  any average photographer will be pleased with the results.
very good camera
solid.
a good zoom
perfect
it takes amazing pictures.  on my last camera i always had to set up the motion function to catch anything not standing still, but this captured a wallaby mid-bounce just on the auto function.  i love the scroll wheel (especially when you need to find the pic you want quickly) an the fact that you can bulk erase selected pictures rather than having to do them one at a time, or erase the whole lot.  the lcd screen is a good size, and once you've taken pics and rotate the camera in your hand, the pic moves round too, a bit like on an iphone.
the camera is small light and extremely easy to use.  the quality of the photos taken were excellent, you dont have to be an expert to use this camera.  the wide angled feature is extremely useful, especially when taking panoramic photos, which you can also stitch together with the software available from cannon.
exceptioally good optical zoom, large and clear lcd screen, very compact given the large range of features, good battery life and rapid recharge. a really excellent camera
easy to use, small and reasonably light weight, picture quality excellent.
means, so i haven't rated this. was really please to be able to get this camera in red! childish, i know... have only just started using it, but, so far, it has coped very well with some difficult conditions and i am very happy with it.
lcd display. good build quality.
nice big and clear display.
great camera for point and shot, but has loads of other features for the more experinced.
great camera, excellent number of features and takes amazing photo's.
switches well between best-fit settings when on automatic.  takes crisp, clear photos in lots of different conditions.
vaguely retro styling is very appealing.
weight
everthing about the camera is excellant apart from the way the flash comes out it always hits your fingers.
easy to use
compact
image quality is the best i have had on a mid priced digital camera.
although this camera is slightly bulkier and sturdier than the new model, i actually preferred this model because although it was not too chunky it was nice to hold where i felt the newer model was too slim.
very good camera and value for money. i normally buy a new camera every couple of years so i have a few, and this is by far the the best one. good value for money and great zoom in lense.
easy to use point and shoot camera with good level of manual settings for those who want a bit more control. fantastic zoom, great quality stills and video.
ease of use and great night time images
excellent optical zoom, and the image stabiliser works well when using the digital zoom too. also impressed with the performance in dim light, which is miles better than my old fuji coolpix camera.
the case, but all is good)
the 12x optical zoom is really great for a pocket camera. so is the wide angle. the fact that theis is so the choice to use it mamually makes it the best pocket camera on the market. a big lens makes sure of great picture quality. and the fact that it goes in your pocket. i cant find a better choice.
easy to use for me-newcomer to digital cameras.
fantastic na and zoom capability, sharp focus and good colour rendering.
i highly recommend this item. but just remember to buy just made in japan items not built in china.
macro, plus loads of effects. excellent price for all the features it has. even experienced photographer friends are impressed by it, (i'm still learning). great size - small enough for my pocket but with features of much larger camera.
a mass of features in such a small package.
12xzoom, auto focus also manual control, battery life is very good over 300 photos per charge.
good build, ease of use, quality photographs
just point and shoot, takes excellent pictures most of the time.
easy to use
good display of information on screen.    nice solid feel to the camera.    even when i set it to a long exposure time there is very little shake.
great zoom facility
zoom lens and compactness.
great zoom and detail
large screen. easy to switch on and off. i have not had time to make use of other settings, so cannot comment.
fantastic zoom and picture quality
this is a great litle camera. it isn't as small as our previous cameras as we do tend to prefer compact models but this performs brilliantly. we took it on holiday and have some fantastic scenery and sunset shots. the viewing screen is a really good size. since purchasing the camera for ourselves we have also bought it for our father who is equally impressed. there is a setting which is for capturing moving children and pets which works excellently...we have some great images of our lively dog and niece and nephew who are always on the move!
stabiliser and zoom
great purchase, good all rounder. great zoom for such a small compact camra. small and light enough to carry on a belt for easy usage. great for holidays.
very fast zoom and quick at taking pictures.  the battery lasts quite a long time and the hd filiming has very good quality sound for such a small camera.
easy to get started and take good photographs on automatic.
it does all canon says it will do    it a fine camera
great feel and colour and packed with features.
very easy to use and good image quality.
full manual control.
structure quality. so easy to use. my first camera and it's is fantastic
using the camera on auto gives excellent results, automatically changing from general views to macro or bright sunlight. the zoom is very good for a camera of this size.  battery life is good.  it feels good in the hand and is very easy to operate.  when i have time, i will look into the manual use but with the other options, this hardly seems necessary!
best zoom out there for a small camera.
easy to use,lightweight.excellent picture quality
i bought this for my sons wedding the quality of the pictures is amazing the colours are vibrant.
i have found very few bad things to say about this camera,only good things!it basically does what it says on the tin!i am delighted with this superb product and would recommend it .
unique lens offers the ability to take pictures that other cameras can not manage. true manual mode allows photographer to truly manipulate images while automatic settings make this a true point and shoot camera with excellent results.
great design combining retro look lens with compact all in one unit. many features giving as little or as much control as you want to get into. plus with hd video it means changing device is no longer needed.
very good zoom and picture quality
portability, zoom, ease of use.  video results excellent
very easy to use and set up.  excellent picture quality and lots of options to take aid easy and quick pictures.  zoom is superb.
macro lens with manual focus option
excellent features to allow creativity with your shots. face recognition is useful. the zoom has a good range from close up subjects to distant objects. excellent definition being 12.1mg pixels. camera battery so much better than having to use aa batteries.
excellent quality photos and easy to use
supurb picture quality and fantastic results for 'far off' subjects.
the zoom and ease of use!
superb little camera with fantastic zoom lens.
the whole setup is so easy to use!

excellent image quality for a compact camera. powerful zoom lens produces good results throughout range and macro settings are excellent. overall a very good little camera.
very easy to use, great macro facility,  very wide angle, great viewing screen. good for easy photo taking on auto/programmed settings but with scope for manual over ride and more creative input.
very good alround.

good quality pics. worth its value.
has a wide range of shooting styles and produces great photos.
love the massive zoom on this product, i now have massive picture of my work colleagues ear. it is easy to use, but still have enough override features.
it's easy enough to use and there's no faffing about with buttons if you don't want the flash on.  you just don't flip it up!
large, clear lcd, excellent optical zoom for price bracket, compact
easy to use and operate. comfortable to hold. excellent zoom.
easy to use and light and flexible .feels comfortable.good all round camera.

excellent image quality and 10x zoom. loads of features including manual control.  small enough to fit in your bag and good size screen.  very good value for money compared to similar spec compacts.
uses aa batteries
everthing
was recommended this camera by 2 friends and i can understand why.superb imageing with a fantastic optical  zoom - as good as it gets.also have a eos400d but this is far better for every day  / holiday use
it was a graduation gift for my daughter and she loves it easy for her to use. she has been taking a lot of photos with it and will have to wait for feed back from her.
ease of use and quality of pictures
excellent image quality, usable images upto iso 1600 and beyond if you're printing a4, fast accurate af, no problems at all, nice file size allows a little cropping if needed, 1d build quality but that's what you'd expect, nice screen compared to the other 1d range
great camera with great images and power. the fps are a wonderful thing. buying this camera takes lots of thought and research but i can assure you that once you own it you'll not regret your decision.
robustness ,pictures quality ,noise management ( especially in low light), quickness...
this camera allows you to keep autofocus when using a 1.4 or 2 x extender depending on the lens used. autofocus is still possible at f 8. it has many custom functions, but you only need to use the ones, which are helpful and suit your type of photography. it is rather intimidating at first, but the internet has lots of advice and then put everything into practice. it is a solid made camera with a good feel to it. the weight is reasonable and with a long lens is still not uncomfortable. hd video is easy to use and superb.
the camera has exceptional build quality and is extremely rugged. it\x92s very adaptable to different situations making it very versatile. the image quality is the best i have seen yet in a canon body and i can\x92t wait to use it more.
i have ben using the !d mark iii for wildlife photography and have been pleased with the resulting images.  the results from friends who have bought the 1d mark iv were even better, especially where image cropping was required.  it is very fast with massive flexibility on focusing points. it is superbly robust and water resistant.  it also provides incredibly fast focusing with my range of af/is lenses. i also find the iso range is much better than the mkiii. i get very little noise even at 800 asa.
excelent quality profesonal grade camera built to last and easy to use it's features.
built like a tank, super features
1.3 x magnification of focal length of lenses - great for sport and wildlife
build quality ( like a tank) image quality. features in general. autofocus speed. comprehensive menus. not forgetting the general feel of the camera
great camera with beautiful images produced from it. its extremely well made and robust. very customisable. great screen and controls.
fantastic build quality and features, with picture quality to go with it.
i previously a pair of 1d mark ii's for 7 years.  i loved those cameras and got some great images from them over the years.  but, the mark iv is a huge improvement to the ii's.  the iso range is wonderful, the battery life is absolutely incredible, and the extra resolution gives me a lot of options when needing to crop a little.
fantastic camera
really great low light ability, no image drop when a field monitor is plugged in to the hdmi slot
it does everything that the 50d does but has the video option which is fantastic. i didnt realise that you can also take a still photo whilst in video mode until i read the manual. the quick control screen is a major bonus over my old 350d. being able to change iso, image quality and metering in seconds really helps with my nature and bird photography. although the build quality is not the same as the 50d its lightness helps when carrying all my lenses with tripods when birding.
provides common (or difficult to find) options quickly. creative modes allow beginners to use it as well as more experienced users. excellent screen display and resolution. resdesigned grip is excellent. depth of field setting provides quite good results, but usually badly fails to include all captured focussing points when using flash.
the quality of image, high iso level in dark conditions and hd movie are the strengths of this product
very small and light comapred to my main 5d mark ii body, easy to use, favourites menu, built in flash.
it continues the build quality that i have learnt to expect from canon
ease of use,  fairly intuitive controls,  large high-def screen.  i bought this to replace an ageing eos300d which was brilliant,  except that with slightly failing eyesight the controls and indicators were getting a bit difficult to read.  the large display on the 500d  is a major improvement in that respect.
i can still use my original lenses from the 350d so it has saved me money.   it is very simple to use and the photographs are outstanding when viewed either on the computer or tv screen through the dvd player.
fantastic screen, good photo image quality
allows you to point and shoot with very little set up but also has the capability to let you select all settings manually. with the addition of full hd video makes it a very comprehensive and versatile camera for the price. also will take all ef/efs lenses
a great camera easy to use, i would recommend the eos 500 d to any one.
exellent and easy to use.
improved on previous model but retaining the ease of use and familiar menu.
a reasonably priced high spec camera.
compact, good quality images.
picture quality, ergonomics, ease of menunavigation, battery life, colour handling.
i have been using the 400d for 3 years, and have found that the upgrade to the 500d is currently good value. i wanted the extra quality of 14 bits rather than 12, and the extra few mega pixels. i also wanted to move to sd cards. live view and camcorder modes are not essential to me, but work pretty well and are a nice bonus. i also think that some of the menu options have been improved, and i like the addition of spot metering. i have played with the raw images in adobe camera raw, and the improved quality has so far not disappointed.
excellent sensor and viewing screen
produces excellent photo's and is not difficult to use.
previous camera was a 400d. best improvements for me are much better high iso (low light) image quality, better customisation features and better preview screen.
can use lenses from old 35mm eos camera; similar look and feel to old 35mm camera; good quality
additional features such as video (hd) introduced but a pity we have to use the screen instead of viewfinder
great iso preformance. really good camera for the pro amature.
easy to use, compatible with previous eos lenses, large file size makes croping for close up images possible.
large screen, video, build quality, simple programmes
as canon, and other makers, are bringing out new models at a rate of more than two a year, there is no need to go for the more professional camera for longivity as the build quality is good enough for the short life it will have.
lots of features. good image quality.
have not used all the features yet but very pleased with the images i have taken so far.
ease of use
great camera, size, functions and build quality. review screen is 1st class
easy to use, and with a lot of features, the image quality is excellent, and hd video mode is very useful.
general allround quality
no steep learning curve from 450d
takes very good pictures, allows plenty of control
very good camera for those wanting something more than the point and click. enjoyable to use and with a little experimentation you'll be pleasantly surprised at the resulting photos.
my 41 year old husband prefers the film cameras, seriously brill camera for all, expensive but you can't beat cannon.
great quality shots once the operator achieves the same standard as the kit.
good quality product
having previously purchased a 450d, the extra features of the 500d justified the purchase of  the 500 d body. the extra pixels, the extra range of iso and the option to use as a cam 'corder proved excellent value for money.  not only that but i could now keep my canon 17 - 40 mm lens on one body and my tamron 18 - 270 mm lens on the other body. allowing me the option of lens without the interchangable aspect.
15mp video
15mp images
very light to carry around, small enough for a pocket or handbag, easy to use even for the novice
its easy to use, i brought it for my 10 yr old and she loves it, i like the rechargable battery that last for ages.
very easy to use and a good clear picture
small and lightweight; high quality image; low power consumption from built in rechargeable battery
very easy to use, bargain price. shopped around for ages and everywhere else  much dearer.
this is a dinky, relatively easy to use camera with all the features you'd expect for a camera in this price range.
best picture quality and very easy to use
excellent little camera which takes great quality images and has loads of features for the price. i found it really easy and intuitive to use.
easy to set up and use as i am notvery good with instructions found this so easy.
brilliant little camera, has excellent build quality especially considering the price. very simple to use, however if you do need to play with the settings you are able to do a little more than point and shoot
easy to use and very easy to carry around . great buy. exellent value for the money.
simple to use (although i had a canon model previously and was already familiar with the menu system).  easy to view and download pictures
very easy to use.
excellent little camera, easy to use, easy to understand instructions, very good photos
it is easy and simple to use. it was replacement of my old olympus 6.0 mega pixel. quality is good and it is good value of money as well. picture quality is fantastic.
light, compact, point and shoot, easy to use.  good video. features i haven't yet used!
this is a fab little camera, i love it!  it's easy to use, lightweight and the picture quality is superb.  the battery lasts well too.  would highly recommend
takes fantastic video and fantastic photos.  basically this is the best camera i have ever owned.  amazing value for money too.  wish i had bought one for my husband as well.
this is my first digital camara and i have to say i'm pretty pleased with it. the picture quality is really good and the instructions are easy to follow.
easy to set up and to get used to, so there is little need to think before taking a shot.
very easy to use and good quality images. battery lasts a long time and quick to recharge.
easy to use, fantastic pictures
still finding-out about all its features.
good sharp lens. acceptable noise(grain) at the lower iso speed ratings.
good value for money.
i was really pleased with this camera. it is really quick when taking the picture so you don't miss what you are trying to take. it's really easy to use i didn't even have to read the instructions.
when i got this camera i found it simple and easy to use. the pictures taken are of great quality.
good basic model, easy to use features and excellent value for money.
clarity and convenience
know when to use macro without telling it
i  have already recommended it to 3 people, and 5 friends and relatives own ixus cameras all of which are very pleased.
compact, and has own special battery and charger so charges from mains and doesn't use up our other general rechargeable batteries.
a good, small, quality build camera which is compact and easy to carry in a shirt pocket if you need to.  good features for a compact camera and i would recommend it.
good value for money. bought it to replace a panasonic lumix fs10 that i lost - this camera was less money and performs better. overall happy with the results.
its a very good buy for somebody that needs an everyday digital camera that doesnt cost a fortune. it takes quality pictures day and night (brightest sunshine and nightclubs) even on auto, saving the hassle of messing around with the iso. the images dont come out blurry (and im an amateur) and are best when the flash is on (even during the day). close up images (flowers, any people that try semi-professional nice pictures from an angle or just focusing the front bit of the image) are absolutely amazing. the wide lense is a lovely feature, even i wasnt expecting to make such a nice difference. would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera for everyday/holiday use, im sure its nothing you will regret!
for price, this camera offers an excellent alternative to more expensive brands which do basically the same thing. it's small, compact and versatile with good image quality. feature menus are well set out making quick adjustments to your image easy.
am now thinking about buying myself one
compact solid build quality, comfortable to hold in use, good battery life. good instructions.
not being a very technical person i find this camera very easy to use.. also the picture quality and focusing are brilliant
nice camera,but yor email says that there was a free case with this camera will i never recieved one with my camera
i've used canon cameras for years and find the functions easy to use
great small and easy to use
good quality camera with amazing price
easy to use, compact size and weight
i like the look and feel of the camera
compact, good quality pictures and video. great value for money.
compact.
very small, slim, compact camera. takes very clear photos. very simple to use.
very compact,battery life excellent.
easy to use
haven't thoroughly explored all the features yet but from what i have seen so far, it handles colours well, takes clear pictures and uses light well. i don't have a problem with it so far.o
easy to use and very light and compact to carry around. fits into your pockets.
fits easily into handbag
clear pictures
good value for money easy to use
its compact its a good clear screen and easy to use.
a highly versatile camera, with many of the same features available on the 'higher end' 7d semi-pro model. i was planning on purchasing the 7d, but having felt the sheer weight of this camera and compared the spec with that of the 550d, only the shooting speed and minor differences in sensor processing seem different to me. the lighter body of the 550d, and much lighter price, swayed me. whilst the top dial presets suggest it is marketed as a 'beginner' dslr, there is plenty for the more serious amateur to get to grips with. indeed, the fact that i haven't really captured the quality of photo i was hoping for as yet suggests that 'tweaking' is an important skill to get the best from it.
great camera, very pleased!!!
solid, well designed camera with the feel of a great film camera.  great viewfinder.  really like the sensor that makes the rear viewfinder picture image disappear when you put the camera to your face. quality of the lens and the images are extraordinary.   loads and loads of clever features which will take me months to work through.  i was an avid film eos user, and am really pleased so far with this new digital version.
the canon ef-s 18-135 lens is a reasonable good all rounder, especially when on holiday.
battery life is also excellent.
having previously purchased the canon 300d and 400d cameras, i had no reservation in purchasing the 550d as an upgrade. the camera produces outstanding performance with ultra crisp sharpness. i was very surprised at the quality of the images from 6400asa setting which corresponded to that from the 800asa setting on the 400d. all the features are ergonomically laid out for ease of operation and no twitching fingers which could unintentionally change the asa setting as on the 400d.
the camera is very fast to operate in manual mode with nice clear menus and display. although i found i use it most in aperture priority mode.  the bundled 18-55mm lens is better than expected too.  i bought it with this lens as i can't afford the lens i really want yet and thought this would get me started. i was very impressed with it.
the performance across the range is at the point where the most important/limiting thing that effects the photographs that you take is the lens not the camera itself -- save on the body by buying the 550d and put the money towards 'l' series lenses!
the video quality is great although it can be a bit tricky at times.
manufacturing methods. after over five decades of serious commitment to the chemical process and to low tech, high build quality, equipment, i took some winning over to the value of the digital process. the 550d is not just a high tech lump of plastic, as i would so often regard such kit, but has the potential for serious image production. once i accepted that it is not a lieca, a hassle, or a broni, i was able to settle down to some serious photography.
would definitely recommend this camera to anyone thinking about buying one, do it, you will not be sorry.
it us a good size in the hand, the never ending pusuit of making things smaller is ok but it can go too far and things become fiddly to use but not this camera.
in the hands. being able to increase the iso rating enabled me to take some good pictures inside a church without using the flash, which is also very handy. the results from the camera are very pleasing, the auto focus and range of metering options are excellent.
so versatile. a good mid-range camera with excellent still and movie capabilities. compares very well with the direct competition.
it's perfect! the quality of video is amazing! and the camera itself is quite light!
having used a hybrid dslr / compact style camera for the last 3 years (panasonic dmc-fz18) i needed to upgrade to a better more professional style dslr camera, and this fits the bill perfectly.  it has great ability to control every aspect of each shot to the finest of changes in exposure, dof, focus, flash adjustments which makes taking photos a lot more fun as the result can be viewed using the dof preview button before you click.  i have not used the on-screen preview as i prefer using the eye-piece.  this camera has taken my photography skills and results to a higher level.
stunning camera for the money. i don't buy anything without looking around for the absolute biggest bang for the buck. just buy this camera. honestly.
now on my third canon dslr having previously owned the 300d and 350d. the 550d is nothing short of superb. was going to buy when it first came out but decided to soldier on with the excellent 350d and wait for the price to reduce. when it did, i bought it and have been more than impressed, especially in low light conditions.
an awesome entry-level dslr with a great kit lens.  the body and lens is of a good build quality.  the menu system is simple, with many beginner and more advanced features.  the lcd is large, bright and crystal clear.
if you have had a canon before it's like meeting an old friend who has had a makeover. very easy to use, clear menus, lovely to hold.
quality feel-lightweight yet sturdy a host of special features some yet to be tried. the image quality on large screen is amazingly good.
i'm a complete amatuer but have taken some cracking shots. still know almost nowt about the camera and how to use properly, but delighted with the results so far.
it does what it says on the tin and does it well. i haven't had the opportunity to explore all the features and i am sure there are many i will never fully use. the image quality is great which was one of the main deciding factors for choosing it.
the 550d has quality written all over it, would recommend a flash gun though, image quality is superb in particular using raw setting.
image quality is superb and obviously the image stabiliser in the lens helps to shoot at lowere shutter speeds than ever before. other than the comment below i cannot fault this camera.
image quality is on par with the canon 7d, hd video is great.  typical canon menu system, works well.  quite a light camera, so maybe a battery pack would give better balance for some.  doesnt have the build quality and weight of the 7d and comparible camera - but then it costs a huge amount less.  somewhat smaller than 7d and similar too, but this isnt necessarily a bad thing.  all in all brilliant cam for the money, punches well above its weight, iso noise control is astounding.
- the most modern construction on the market
use didnt come with memory card which would have been better so you can start to use straight away very good battery life
canon 550d is a very good camera for budding photo ensuastic like me. it produce a good quality image, and with a small hand i can handle it features with such an ease. and it also produce a good video. i intend to use the camera for photos only but sometimes you really can capture precious moment with a great video which is very handy with this model. price-wise, i think i got myself a bargain.
the screen menu and buttons are easy to use/ navigate for an amaetuer like myself and the jog dial is excellent. produces very good quality images.
how long do you have? there are so many - too many to mention... okay, how about the self timer shot.  not one, but you can take multiple shots in the same sitting giving you the option to pick a great image instead of having to retake.  loved this feature.  the screen, live view, video - yes video and it's fab.  hd recording... sd card expanson.  superb build quality coupled with a nice cannon lens.  you'll soon be wanting to upgrade the lens if you're into amateur wildlife or photography that needs a photo zoom, such as planespotting  - while i am mainly using this camera for.
brilliant camera - meant as a second body to take my other lens but has become my main
a pleasure to use light and compact
results are excellent. it was bought to supplement previous eos digital models and it hasn't disappointed.
excellent quality pictures, brilliant iso control for low light environments. easy to use, if you want a starter slr thats fun and easy to use this one is worth the money!
an excellent camera, well made, great features. basically the same technically as the 600d but without the movable lcd display. overall a great camera!
the 550d is amazing! the image quality is awesome and the video quality is outstanding!
everything!! the image quality is excellent and the camera is easy to use. for the price these are going for now they are a bargain and others don't come close.
fantastic camera, easy to use and amazing quality of the pictures..love it,
i'm thrilled this camera is wonderful
superb image quality and handling. excellent features that compensate for the high price.
brilliant pictures and such a pleasure to use with so many very usefull features as for instance vairable shutter speeds at the turn of the dial and such sharp pictures.
very easy to use, takes excellant photographs. the movie option is extremly good especially taking air craft like the red arrows.great being able to shoot through the lcd.
great camera for a novice photographer like me.  i've got some great holiday snaps with it.  it's quick to use if you just want to take a quick snap.  i've also got some nice long exposure photos of the night sky.  fab.
camera has ability to take stunning photographs - even with supplied 'cheap' lens. video abilities are incredible. shooting hd video at 24fps creates incredible film like imagery that is clearly broadcast quality. don't worry about the inability to auto focus as normal camcorders do - because it is really easy to manually focus using liveview
range of features
it's almost impossible to take a poor quality photograph when set to 'idiot' mode (full auto) for more serious photographers it has all the functions of pricier cameras and the sheer 'wow' factor from those who see your photos.
really great size, and a dream to use. really well equipped camera for the money, and gives outstanding images.
a wise choice for those amateurs who want to upgrade their gear:stunning pictures,decent features,very good build quality
just love it
bought after fairly extensive research but opted for this over nikon 3100 / 5100 and eos1100d (poor build quality). whilst the eos600d was also available this was much more expensive for little gain (flexible lcd screen). overall very satisfied with 5550d. easy to use, great picture quality and lots of manual options to explore.
new metering mode gives really good white balance, compare to my old dslr. high iso, which makes picture fully usable/printable even with slow shutter speed. gotta say, the kit lens really surprised me. i was expecting it to be completely useless, but it's quite good. what about movie mode, it shoots 1080p videos 24/25/30 fps - what else you need?! the best thing about 550d is it's price.
software appears to be good
simple to use.
good camera with plenty of features. a camera for beginers to experienced users.
my first slrcamera proven to be very exciting the quality of picture fab
despite being predominantly plastic, it's very good, solid plastic solidly constructed.  it is very simple to get going if you want to just point and shoot on full auto, conversly it has a mass of featues to be creative when you want to be and have had the time to learn how to use such features.  the video function (hd) is excellent and the 300 or so photos i've tken so far have been of a really good quality.
very easy to use, even for a beginner like me. perfect quality pictures and videos even in low light.
great quality, hd video shoots at a great high pixel rate.
large screen on back a delight.
overall satisfied.
best entry level dslr currently available.
digic 4 processor is amazing, it delivers minimum noise even at high iso ratings.
great price for a widely highly-rated camera. fabulous image quality, great features for a newbie to the slr world.
brought this for the 18 meg pixel, top quality, has all the features of the 600, except the the swivel viewfinder. no complaints as yet, great variety in auto focus and endless other features
brilliant camera! am still getting to grips with all the settings. think it will take a while, but that is not a bad thing, as my photography skills can develop with this camera. considering i am a beginner, i have been able to take some beautiful photos already. can't wait to use it when on holiday in iceland.
first dslr having used a canon eos film camera some years ago.  the image stabilisation is superb, even on relatively short focal lengths, so much so that my old canon lenses seem poor in comparison.  so much more usable than my compact digital
wonderful crystal clear photos with endless creative potential
very easy to use without reading the entire manual. it feels a very solid camera and the picture quality is really good.
fantastic for film and photography, the video quality is full hd which is great for its price and the lens makes everything much better.
havnt really had the camera long enough to find all its +s and -s, but initially, more than pleased
this is a high quality and very flexible piece of equipment. i am no great expert but found that what it claims to do it does.
build quality, comfortable handling, still very useable even for a novice!
i like everything about this camera .the video clips i take with this camera looks great even in normal indoor lighting.                 overall its a great camera
i looked carefully at buying an eos 50 but on evaluating the 550 i realised that as an amateur, the spec was better on the 550. money wasn't an issue, but i think i saved loads of money and got a great product.
simple enough to pick up and shoot straight away but has enough features to keep even an experienced photographer busy!
easy to use, excellent image quality for both still and hd video.  camera is quick to start up and responsive during use.
what a piece off kit. everything for the amateur to an expierenced photographer. will have years off use.
i am very happy with my purchase
lightweight, all usual canon functions
easy to use once you've read the manual and practised! beautifully built, it falls to hand very easily and has a good weight about it without being too heavy. i would recommend buying the battery grip as this adds to it's ease of use. excellent piece of kit.
fantastic camera- great value.  easy to pick up and shoot but with plenty of options for the seasoned pro :)
just love it
more or less point and shoot....with loads of possibilities available for further exploration!
we bought this to take pictures of our family etc.i must say best investment yet! my wife has never used an slr before and says it so easy use on auto and the semi auto setting, she has even managed to achieve great images as if she was taking on manual setting
great picture quality, great screen size, nice to handle and controls easy to use
to many to mention
easy to use for the beginner - plenty of features for the amature-professional.
this is easy to review. a superb piece of kit as the saying goes. i love it.
a great piece of kit. good functions and features. matched with excellent results. brilliant!!
i love the combination of the eos 550d with the 18 - 135mm lens.  this is fine for most situations, an avoids the need for too many lens changes.  (the image quality is good enough to do any further zooming later digitally)
this is my first dslr and i found it to be very easy to use, and the image quality is brilliant (it's like a breath of fresh air compared to my old camera)!
easy to use and takes sharp detailed pictures.
it is very simple use, very self explanitary
having used point and shoot cameras for a while following the demise of my minolta slr this is simply fabulous. easy to use
this camera has just about every feature you can get - well pleased
everything 10/10.

excellent camera for astrophotography, with low noise even in long exposures
book to assist me with the use of this camera (ie which settings work best in which lighting/environment) however overall i cannot praise this camera enough.
set up properely you can get sharp images with good exposure. i am just an amateur but i getting good results with this camera
started using straight away, easy to use, looks good quality.
easy to use and fantastic image quality.
very light and the picture quality is superb.
once you have gotten around the features and settings  i found it easy to use and i am looking forward to experimenting in manual focus
many customisation possibilities with image settings
the camera is fantastic - decent value for money and some nice new bits of technology that make it really worthwhile especially if you set it up with some good glass.

a lot of features, good step up from earlier models.
very easy and intuative for a point and shoot/keen amateur user. i love the image quality and my partner loves the noise it makes on continuous shoot!
lightweight, good build quality, good photos and video, included kit lens are very light and the image quality is acceptable, the only extra required to start taking pictures is a sd card
i had my 1000d stolen and up graded to 550d. the picture quality is so much bettet. i'm very new to cameras and not used all the features yet. the 18-135 lens is the best thing ever.
it's an excellent camera, does everything i want and more
far exceeds expectations
very easy to use
money well spent
for a amateur photographer its got everything you want. we are still getting used to it.

its just a great camera what more can i say
excellent for beginners and experimenters alike (although i need to learn more before i try this).
what can i say, it's my first slr camera and it's as good as i expected, i suppose for what i paid it should be top quality pictures, quite easy to use  not to heavy but most of all image qualty is stunning, 1080hp video mode is fantastic

really super, fairly compact camera -can't go wrong with the automatic setting, so you get great quality pictures immediately while you learn how to use the other functions properly
this is my first dslr and it's a great camera, easy to use, build quality as expected of a canon product.
really good mid-range canon dslr, fairly easy to use and change settings. you can get some cracking images once you get used to customising and working in the various modes.
comprehensive instruction manual.
its a cannon. quality product pleasure to use.image quality need i say more.
it just feels nice, loads of tips and lessons on youtube for 550d, so you pick up what to do very quick, if this is your first digital slr
easy to use for the beginner but plenty to learn!
ease of use
pr\xe9cision des clich\xe9s pris en mode  automatique.

first camera of this type for me, simple to use easy guide big wow factor
lens does the job
very good for starters and good options for photography learners
excellent camera, easy to use and superb picture quality
brilliant beginner entry level camera, build quality is sturdy and feels great.
it is far easy then most cams for showing you all whats on offer on the top of the cam, its not heavy and its made really well and isnt too big.
picture quality at all levels
the camera is also lightweight and relatively compact.
excellent brand (of course). being a total beginner i find the many auto settings invaluable. of course as experience is gained the many personalised settings can then be utilised. this means great photos can be taken almost immediately, without having to wade through a comprehensive instruction manual.
user friendly, with a vast array of features that you would find on a more expensive mid entry camera. video mode is exceptional with the ability to create quite stunning broadcast quality creations
great little camera
very easy to use and i am a beginner. currently on a short course to learn how to use it better!
everything, can be used as point and shoot or for some really creative pics
very easy to use, some good features for an entry level dslr, it feels to have a good build quality, very good image quality, manual settings are very easy to use. very good value camera and if you are moving from a bridge or a better point and shoot you won't be disappointed.
accessories easy to find
feels good to use - as a totally amateur user i could pick it up, set it to auto and take some really good looking pics.
has a ca screen where you can easily get to a variety of changes in one screen in cases where you need to take different photos quickly.
as an amateur, this camera is very easy to use and photographs look very professional. swapping between manual and auto is very simple
find it easy to use in all functions
really good camera - so easy to use and understand.  felt like a professional using it.
lots of ato selections for beginers
simple to take nice enough photographs, good kit lens
i loved the picture quality
very easy to use.  just set to basic mode (autofocus, automatic), focus and shoot.
nice grip, excellent image quality. loads of features.
i love dis camera
excellent camera, easy to use and gives professional pictures.
great bundle.  the 550 d is much better value than 600 which has only marginally better features.  the ef-s 18 -135 lense  is great walk about lense
love the manual focusing as very quick!
bought this for my trip to the states and have no regret took over 2000 pictures. once you use an slr all other cameras seem useless
tr\xe8s bon objectif, qualit\xe9 de photo vraiment extra
the camera is great, very happy!
very good starter slr camera recommended to beginners.
best camera bought do far ;). would recommend buying this camera to anyone. this is my first dslr so can't compare to others but so far so good. n
an excellent camara which is easy to use and is well balanced,
ease of use, handling and picture quality
the camera is excellent alrounder
excellent image quality ,large screen ,lovely compact and light weight body . great asa range and fantastic quality of images taken at low light . very easy to use for the experienced amateur. great range of options ,very good high definition video images
excellent low light ability, hd video quality, and consitent quality metering in auto mode. excellent exposure reading in most situations. great compact pocketable size! and shoots in raw! mini hdmi conection good to.
all good except bad points below
excellent camera. researched for ages. looking for pocket camera to complement my 7d. image quality is excellent and raw is a bonus. very good manual adjustments and auto is good as well (no raw in auto). bought another one for my father !!
hdr, color accent, size, image quality, sensor size
generally intuitive and easy to use. good picture quality, particularly under poor lighting conditions.
high quality camera which shows in reviews to be little less, if any, from its radically more exprensive big brother, the g12. compact and easy to carry around. the pictures are beautiful in their colour and really do reflect the reality of the object you are photographing.
picture quality is excellent, especially in low light. an impressive array of creative options.
excellent low light capability and high iso without substantial noise.
excellent picture quality in its class especially in dim light., lots of dslr-like features that can be customized. basic features easy to handle.
lightweight and small but sturdy, with well designed, easily accessible controls in all shooting modes, including manual.  the image stabilisation generally copes well with my slightly shaky hands.
a real joy to use for an enthusiast
ease you use, very light and small, one click solution
very good images quality
nice compact camera well build. excellent images. easy to use.
neat, compact, solid
great camera, love it! it seemed a bit hard to hold originally (i'm left handed) and i had to practice a few different handholds. however, the features, image quality and build quality make up for this.
raw images files, very quick and easy to manally adjust exposure if camera is fooled by the scene, nice solid feel to the camera but it could benefit by finger grips on the design to give the camera a more secure grip in the hand
image quality
image quality is good for this size of sensor.
jpeg modes (i find raw is essential for underwater photography which is my specialty). fairly good iso sensitivity for poor light shooting.
being able to take photos in raw and full manual control
best compact camera i have ever had. you can take this anywhere, fits neatly in your pocket and picture quality is first rate.
it's a fantastic all rounder. which is nice to hold. have just used this camera on holiday and it's been a pleasure to use. didn't do too well in low  light. but that could be because i've not set it properly. but i adore the camera and would buy this model everytime.
great camera takes awesome pictures
small and easily portable.  shoots in raw.
the s95 is an awesome piece of kit!!!
great little camera. image quality is fantastic for the size. low light performance the best i have used in a pocket camera. it's quick for a pocket camera too. vibration reduction works great. stereo sound on the video capture!  screen bright and clear. reviewing images and zooming nice and fast, as it should be. good control dials (particularly the front lens-mounted wheel). best pocketable camera for those who like cameras (though i'm not getting rid of my d700, it certainly gets less use now...!)
easy to use. intuitive menu layout. great image quality - ability to shoot in raw makes the world of difference. like the use and versatility of the lens ring. i experienced the battery life to be better than what i have read on reviews prior to my purchase.
absolutely first class camera - easy to use from the moment its picked up - takes great pictures in auto mode - brilliant for capturing those all important 'children on the move won't stay still to say cheese' moments!  love the pictures and clarity.  all in all a brilliant little camera for the price.
compact body size; quality and size of display screen; excellent low light performance.
very compact, x-small, fits into a pocket easily, good features, excellent image quality for this type of compact camera.
good image quality in low light situations, lots of features
auto modes
small and pocketable with good quality results take anywhere camera
manual controls. very good photos at low light conditions.
excellent images
overall an excellent camera. feels more substantial in your hands than a 600d. excellent screen. well laid out menu controls.the camera will easily take more than 400 pictures in raw format on a single battery. the 17-85mm kit lense is ok and seems sharpest around 50 mm.
it is an excellent camera for the serious hobbyist - the camera feels solidly built, picture quality is very good even under some difficult cinditions, the burst speed for sports shots is impressive!
a very good camera with a nice feel about it, easy to use and good instruction book
i am used to using a full pro body( nikon d2xs and nikon d3) but i didn't need these any more and made the move to this canon!! not something i am regretting! great camera!
series lens on it.  flip screen has it uses when you need to hold the camera up high to get a shot.  camera can turn raw into jpegs and can fire most canon flashes remotely.
although its a higher level dslr than the entry level cameras it doesnt confuse the amateur user but enables you to learn more complex features and produce better pictures.
great images. easy to use. i can still use my older canon lenses which saved me a lot of money.
it's my first dslr and i love it. everything is fantastic, right down to battery life.
has the point and shoot starter option(where i am now) through to almost professional programming mode (where i want to be)
great choice of lens
easy to using and not too heavy,is good for women use too.
good lens and build quality is very good, like the reversible screen. picture quality is excellent too.
quality
love it, used to have an slr years ago
the large number of facilities and options, including: spirit level, folding lcd screen, multiple images with different exposure settings at the press of a button.
easy to use
controls are very intuitive, easy to use and nicely positioned on the body for making quick adjustments during shooting. the recording / filming features are excellent and the flip screen is really useful for out of reach shots.the quality of both the photos and films are top notch.
excellent feel, build quality, looks, features, i love this camera.

very easy to use, controls are well positioned and very logical
excelent image quality, packed with features and raw image procesing within the camera so no need to spend hours on the pc. an easy camera to take you from novice using the auto modes which do an excelent job,  to learning how to use the camera in the semi auto and manual modes.
first dslr so im no expert , but from a compact camera to the 60d my images are just brilliant now , the fun in now looking for things to take photos is getting me out so much more than i thought it ever would , early mornings to late evenings .. just a brilliant bit of kit.
supriseingly ease of use and controls
lack of noise at hugh iso
feels well made.  fast response and good image quality
very impressed, sturdy and feels like a 'proper camera'. a great upgrade from my 400d.
multi way lcd screen is excellent when used with the video feature.
fantastic camera, fully loaded with the latest features. a great buy.
all the bells and whistles of a full-format sized camera. more than adequate for a keen amateur.
its a great back up camera to my 5d 2ii and it performs surprisingly good in comparison... iso capability is excellent and the screen is really good resolution too..
good value, great camera and great photographic images
very good product, excaltly as expected
excellent image quality, 18-135mm is able to produce some lovely images, easy to use, solid in the hands even with the plastic body, pretty good in low light. an all round good piece of kit.
good zoom range, generally good image quality
amazing image quality, feels robust, good connectivity
excellent camera, lens is very good too. both combined can lead to great results.
good value
good quality camera with decent lens.  having had a lower range canon eos before it was great that there are many similar features and functions in the same way.  the 60d has more features though which is great.  the camera feels nice a solid yet not too heavy and the video is easy to use and the built in sound is susrprising quite good.
easy to use but it also has lots of features which can be grown into as i become more familiar with the camera. also i can use a macro lens that i previously used with another canon film camera.
a great camera, does exactly what it should
great camera at a great price
good ergonomics, vast number of lenses available, robust build.
great camera
easy to use. video quality is excellent.standard lens is grand.
the camera is has a lot of features that you wouldn't normally get with a camera of this price, it also feels very rugged and well built.
great features, upgraded from the canon 100d and would definitely recommend this product.
fast shutter speeds, ideal for wildlife and sports. sensor cleaner. good build. quick to switch from video to stills and vice versa
veiw screen a great feature  - usual canon quality
surprisingly light weight, first time dsrl user and very impressed
really recommend it!!
excellent sharpness of images even at magnification.
this model is excellant for the crossover from slr to digital, features are endless which can be found in the dearer models. the ease of picture taking is exceptional, and limitless.a great starter dslr highly reccomended.
just a great product
top of camera controls easier to use than my previous model (eos 30d)
great features and image quality, the camera just feels well built.
veryttelyt easy to use.
every feature you could wish for at your finger tips. great product support from canon.
lovely camera .. great model to start learning more about slr and photography ... combines manual and automatic features beautifully.
easy to use, compatible with my lenses from old eos 450d
feels sturdy, very easy to use even for an amatuer. amazing picture quality. great camera, great value for money. highly recommended model.
easy to learn. good lenses available. easy to hold b
no  doubt about the product which is good i have been using it from last four months
i have achieved good audio by attaching a zoom h2n via its headphone socket to the 3.5mm mic socket on the camera. by fiddling with the camera's manual gain, and the zoom h2n's headphone volume, i was able to match the audio meter on the zoom with that on the camera. this way i can still monitor audio levels while shooting video (using the zoom), even though the camera won't let you see its audio meter while shooting.
good balence and body shape. higher quality at higher iso values allowing for faster shutter speeds in low light. 18-55mm lens has been improved and has a more solid feel which is better on manual focus setting.
good image and video quality. good build quality too for the money.
for the price and features it excels against any rivals in the same range
then you move on to program mode, av; tv, etc.!  an absolutely brilliant photo taking machine.  highly recommended.
big touchscreen, easy to use, great quality photo's as expected from 12mp, better than expected photos in not so bright enviroment, i read up and purchased due to the f 2.0 which is the wide angle ability to allow light into the shot, but you loose a bit of the rear focus ( i.e. you focus on a person and the hills in the distance are not brilliant in focus) but i purchased for the light shot (indoor photo without flash) so is exactly what i wanted, brilliant camera...
good quality of the pictures.good size,nice shape.worth money.
small enough to put into your pocket.
point and shoot results are very good. i'm not experienced enough to comment on the manual/creative modes though.
a good camera for all occasions hd video is good as well
touch screen, like the feature of tapping corner of camera to scroll through your pictures, you can do this one handed - great!!
the colours are very true to life, very flxible in manual mode exceptionally. will no longer use my hd digital cam corder as this is better. i went on holiday the day it came and started using it straight away v v good .
excellent image quality, excellent video quality. compact and easy to use. unclutered design thnaks to touch screen interface. excellent optics
build quality and image quality
the touch screen makes settings a breeze. also, starting and stpping videos from the touch screen makes movie taking simpler than having to set a switch.
does what it says on the box- pleased, would recommend
excellent all round camera with lots of good features and \xa340 cashback from cannon
10 out of 10
excellent selection of scene mode, good battery life and good image even in  low light (photo)
nice clear pictures
small quality camera for easy photo's and videos, i purchased an extra battery but have not had to use it as battery life good. i have not yet read the manual fully but found the features easy to use and find simply by trying the menu.
great value for money.  particularly like the way you can easily change the resolution to get more photos  out your memory card/upload straight to facebook etc
it felt it also coped well with poor light conditions with the flash off
the screen size and quality of the picture is the best feature as you can review a photo and know instantly it's a good one and not have to wait till you download it to your pc.  the camera is very simple to use and i really like the face tracker which works automatically.
lightweight, simple to use on auto.  ability to be cleverer if the owner can keep up !! screen size excellent and image quality first class.  big improvement on the ixus110.
great all round camera. really good image quality. very easy to use
great image quailty
a very compact and yet robust camera. easy to use and easy to purchase accessories eg case, memory card etc
good build quality and easy to use
early days but nice easy to use camera. good price for canon quality
easy to use. clear sharp pictue quality.
small so very easy to keep in my handbag.  easy to use, i have had canon camera's before so know my way around them fairly well anyway.  very happy with it.
compact, good quality pictures and easy to use zoom - usual canon quality, value for money point and shoot.
exceptionally good camera
easy to use as not too complicated
excellent wee camera, fantastic colour and the picture quality has been really great - i still have to try it in low light (which is the reason i chose this over alternative cameras) as the hs is meant to excel in this arrea
ready for use as soon as you switch on. excellent screen, clear to view even in sunny conditions. the image quality with flash off inside buildings is extremely good.
the zoom is fantastic for such a compact camera.i had an ixus previously and wanted a better zoom and pixal. i have got this for a very reasonable price
the lithium battery, as opposed to aa batteries, means that it can be used for a full day without the need to carry spare batteries.
very light and compact. picture quality is very good for a camera this size. lots of different shot modes and the full auto make it extremely easy to use. the full hd video is excellent. all in all a great camera in a quality well built package as you would expect from canon.
everything..had a canon ixus 95 is before and lost it.bought a lumix fs9. was so disappointed in the lumix compared to my original canon.so bought my canon ixus115 is and just love it
the camera is good for causal use specially when you are travelling and need something light to carry and take photos .
there's a lot packed into this neat little camera. it's ready to take pictures almost as soon as the power button is pressed. exceptionally good in low light situations - you can take photos indoors without the need for flash. the video facility is very easy to use and gives good results.
brought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!!!
when i brought my first digital camera 7 years ago, i always intended to buy a canon as they look far superior to others on the market. however the salesman talked me into buying a pentax and although this has served me well and was a good camera, when i decided to buy a new one, i went for the canon. the features seem endless and the camera is very easy to use. the build and print quality are very good. would highly recommend. with the canon cash back offer, it was an absolute steal!
excellent camera. no poor plastic quality. beautiful and simple to use with excellent features. i love it!
automatic focus is great. pictures look professional although i'm very much an amature. good size and weight of camera and love the bright pink colour i got.
super quality, compact, easy to handle, long battery life, versatile, superb images, cannot fault it. this is the third canon ixus i have purchased for myself and my family.
it only has good points i found it takes brilliant photo's even in poor light.the macro lense takes very close clear pictures and landscape shots also very good.all around it is a compact very versitile camera i am very pleased with it.
very good quality pictures and video, good value for this money
a very versatile and stylish camera.  good functionality whilst remaining relatively simple to use
very good in poor light
easy to use even without instructions.  good picture quality.
quality of build and images. ease of use, battery longevity, easy to connect to computer and download images, convenient size.
small and light, easy to slip in to a pocket or handbag. very easy to use.
good battery life.easy to use with excellent results.pocket sized.
its easy to use, even for a complete novice, small and compact but with a good viewing screen so you can see what you've taken.  and best of all its pink!
the high shutter speed has given some really good results that my previous camera may not have achieved.
easy to use straight out of the box; ideal for someone who wants a camera that is simple to use, but with the options of being able to change some of the settings. can't give a great deal more information as i bought this for a present for someone else but i did take a few test shots with it and the image quality was excellent.
amazing range of features- my favourite being the ability to control the camera using your tv's remote when it is connected to it via hdmi. 1080p videos are superb.
beautiful light weight. does everything my old camera and video used to do at a fraction of the size.
love it best one i have has so far
really amazing camera takes lovely photos and has impressive features with the slow motion video option
lots of other functions to use if needed,
compact and takes good pictures with fast saving to sdhc class 10 card.  full hd video recording at 24 fps and hd recording at 30 fps.  the full user manual is on the cd.
great camera for everyday use!  would recommend to anyone for use at social occasions, holidays and day-to-day..  my fourth canon camera in ten years.  the last three purchases are still working excellently too!
what i expect from canon, simple to use with good quality pictures at a good price
easy to use and excellent picture quality especially videos, purchased 16gb memory card and used it on holiday to usa with excellent results
solid build ,feels sturdy,easy to use.
superb quality in such a small package
really easy to use,great colours and image quality in light and dark. video is nice feature and good quality again.
compact. good range of settings. now sized screen. good price
easy to use. large screen.
the low image quality was due to a fault overall i liked the camera had it not been for that fault.
this camera is amazing value for money. it's an amazing type and the features are the best. there are tons of amazing features to help you snap the best pictures. the picture quality is very good and i am very pleased that i purchased this camera. it was much cheaper than i originally thought it would be.
cannot fault it.. brilliant!!
small very light and easy to use.
very easy to use.
excellent picture quality and easy to use.
quick start up - large screen - quick access video button - nice and light to carry around on holiday -easy to use - good results from fully automatic setting- good in low light conditions without flash.
very compact easy to use camera. makes great movies, and very clear too. would definately recommend this.
excellent overall camera
.
everything i wanted from a compact camera.
small - quality
fairly sturdy
the photographs are so bright and such good colour. it's a very smart camera with some really nice setting options and a nice big lcd screen. really good value.
good picture
great value-for money
it takes excellent pictures for a compact camera, it is very easy to use and has a very large screen on the back which is perfect for taking, and then reviewing, your pictures. while i haven't taken many videos on it, the video quality is superb and you don't need to change the mode from manual/automatic to video as there is a recording button on the back screen, useful for sudden developing videos! plus, it looks very nice!
very good camera
low weight
good quality photos and easy to use
image quality, focus check and large screen.
compact size
camera does it all for you. superb
good quality well built camera with smooth modern looks!
auto focus is good.
really nice to hold, very easy to use, great little features and settings. perfect for happy snapping like i do, i've a dslr as well, but when i don't want to carry around that big thing, i take this. very large screen, great little camera that produces quality pictures!
i have always been a canon ixus user. i wanted an upgrade from a previous model that i had for the past 6 years. this is great, it's still the same just with higher features. if you want a simple point and shoot camera without the fuss that takes great quality pictures then this is the one for you.
nice size and a great solid feel to the camera
simplicity - good clean, clear photos
nice movie quality
picture quality and features. also full manual control.
it's very easy to use and takes good photos
cracking image quality for such a small package. video impressive. deserves what camera's highest score for the price range.
really clear good sized lcd screen, very easy to use, amazing picture quality in all light conditions.
brilliant point and shoot camera. sharp quality images at a great price.
good picture quality.
this is the second ixus 115 hs i have purchased in six months as this one was for my son, i was so impressed with the quality, ease of use and more than happy with the price, you could easily spend twice this amount and still not get the features this camera has.
easy to use camera even for novice photographer.
great little all round camera.
camera fr my wife, excellent quality, easy to use, fits in handbag. loves the colour
screen
very clear screen, good to review photos on.
straightforward use
good quality and great value!
loads of settings, good quality pictures, light and compact
takes really sharp images
great photo's, easy to use.
compact -well built quality camera
nice large screen.
vibrant colours
easy to use from the box, auto function selects shooting mode and identifies people in shots. slim design. very good value for money due to canon cashback in spring 2011.
so the battery and memory card
good clear photographs easy to use
a brillant camera
good build quality. fits nicely into a woman's hand. so, my wife and daughter find it a delight to use.
great colour pink.  great photos.  haven't quite got the hang of the menus yet, but has good features when i can figure out how to get them in a hurry!
point and shoot simple, usually all i need.
intuitive and good quality pictures. fantastic battery life.
good auto feature
good lens right from zoom in to zoom out. colours good.
the canon ixus 115 hs is small and fun to use. the auto mode produces excellent photos and there is a huge range of useful and fun modes to play around with. there are lots of great deals around for this camera so the value for money is excellent.
easy to use and compact - fits nicely into a pocket which is what i wanted.   haven't had it long but am satisfied that i can use it and that the quality of photos are fine for my use.
i bought it to replace an ixus 40 which i was very pleased with.  i like the newer features but haven't had it long enough to try everything yet.
i purchesed the cannon sx210 is to provide an alternative to my slr and it does that with style. it's compact size gives easy yet professional performance. it is fun to use because the range of features offers the opportunity to shoot in all conditions without having to spend valuable time 'setting up'. offering the settings choice of 'easy shot' and 'auto' as well as manual really does give this camera a powerfull edge. i love it's descreate size which makes you feel comfortable in crowded places. it's just packed with user friendlineness and photographic features all at a very competative price.
oh yes - 720p video what more can you want.  my sony hd camcorder is getting worried now!!
the 14x is fantastic. fantastic picture quality. my son doesn't sit still for 10seconds so getting a pictureof him that isn't blurred is a struggle - my nikon coolpix  was never up to the job (or maybe my photography skills weren't) but this canon is just perfect on auto and there's just never a blur. the red-eye reduction feature works a treat - it's not the double flash, it actually has a feature that finds red-eye after the photo is taken and removes it for you in the photo. i'm still getting used to all the features (eg panoramic stitching) so having it work well on auto is a relief. there's lots of comments on here about the positioning of the flash but you get used to it, and if you have your finger holding it  down by mistake you can easily flick the flash back up manually - not an issue at all.
can be used in manual or automatic.
simple point and shoot with a degree of flexibility for creativity. fantastic zoom yet still retaining adequate quality at max zoom. bought as a back up to my dslr's but seems to be supplanting them.
its extremely easy to use, all functions are easy to follow, its just so easy to get to know your camera, it has a few extra functions that my xs200 dos'nt have  which makes going from framed pictures to moving pictures without having to change.
point and shoot! good image quality.
i love it!
just slips into your pocket so you can take it anywhere........surprising performance and easy to use
superb pictures.  the people at canon really made this to be a great camera.
the image quality is fantastic! the pictures take every little detail of the object you are taking a photo of. even when you use the video part of the camera, it still keeps the same high level of quality. the zoom is absolutely fantastic as well! could not believe that i could still take such a sharp picture of an object so far in the distance. also, i love the feature that automatically takes a picture of you when you smile! absolutely fab.
very good value for money.
this is an easy to use camera which gives good results in even quite poor light.  excellent focusing system.
just about all of it. i love that it turns on and it ready to take pictures really quickly. you do have to take time to learn it, but that is not a bad thing as there are so many features. however, it functions really well as a point and shoot too so you really get the best of all worlds. also, i have had mine for a while, taken loads of photos and videos, done loads of playback and still on the first charge of the battery. all good!
great as a day to day camera for concerts etc
it is very easy to use and has so many features that make it seem like a 'big' camera but this fits easily in a handbag or pocket.  i love it the more i use it.
solid built canon product with easy use, excellent features as per other canon cameras. i also own and use two canon non digital slrs
amazing zoom quality and  many features that make taking great photos easy.
image quality and close focusing,i do a lot of flower studies and this camera is ideal for this. ease of carrying, i am used to the weight of an slr canon, 450d, so this new toy is far more convenient, and less heavy, in use.
compact, loads of features (still yet to find them all), very easy to use and great zoom!
exelent manual functions which are very easy to navigate. i like that when you change the settings manually, that you can see the adjustment as you look through the screen. the camera does not have a view finder so you use the display screen as a view finder which is great as it gives you more freedom when taking photos. it is a nice size camera and feels sturdy, the image quality is excellent aswell as having excellent quality video. i have to say im a happy snapper with this one :)
durable and attractive with many excellent features. love the way when you view images the screen changes from landscape and portrait.
i am a novice at taking photos, but even my photos look good. the picture quality is fantastic and i and playing around with it rying different things and enjoying myself
various lenses.
easy to get started, zoom does what it says, pictures are good.
amamzing photo
surprisingly powerful optical zoom.  overall picture quality very good with natural colours.  contrary to some reviewers, i rather like the pop-up flash as you can be sure it won't flash by mistake if the unit is not allowed to pop up.
has the feel of a quality product as soon as you pick it up, but compact enough to carry around in your pocket. it has masses of features, which i am still learning about, but it is as easy or as complicated as you want it to be. it has an automatic setting if you just want to point and shoot, or it has all the manual settings for light, shutter speed etc. plus it has various integral colour filters. great value little camera.
white function but hey, you can't have it all.  it's sometimes too quick for me, so it takes abit of getting used to if you're an amateur like me.  well worth it though.
would def recommend it!
there are no gimmicks....it is easy to use. i bought this product as a gift,so the package with the extra battery was extremely useful. also to add to this package, i want to purchase an underwater housing as the recipient wants to use when diving.
excellent everyday camera with a bit more control when you want it
unlike the previous sx200, the flash can fold away when not in use.
amazing image stabilisation at full telephoto. colour and light/dark balance great. everything i expected from a canon camera.
excellent picture quality. good in lowlight conditions.
different features, inc. minituare mode, fisheye lens. easy to use with good quality pictures.
the hd video quality is really good u can zoom right in as far as it will go and you don't loose any of the quality.
provides detail on screen for the different shooting modes so you don't need to keep referring to the manual. well worth using these to get the advantage of the setting in differing conditions.
brilliant zoom, fits in my handbag, full manual capability
compact camera.  wideangle view.  reasonably easy to use.  good battery and recharger, especially as included with the product.
bought it for my mum - she is not very good with cameras. but this one was easy to use, with good quality pictures and video - everything she needed. plus, the screen is bright and big!
movie.  so far only used on auto setting but extremely pleased with results.
excellent zoom, very stylish, quick to take photos, lots of different modes and features (tv mode is very handy)
slim enough for handbag, lightweight for holidays, nights out, easy to use
excellent zoom.  easy to use takes an excellent picture
after all photo cameras i had in the past, it is the best one ever! it's a good size camera, with big zooming program, captures every detail. even it's takes the picture itself if you smiling. the life of the battery is quite good. but i bought an extra one in any case. there is so many good things about this camera. you have to try it. i recommend to everyone who enjoying amateur and home photography.
easy to use so anyone can get great photos with it, but also has feature that may come in handy for the more experienced photographer and anyone looking to better there photos.
easy to use
easy to use, great size, fantastic image quality
very impressive features and size for a 14x zoom camera. ideal if you want to go out without too much stuff, just put it your pocket! with a camera this good, you don't need a dslr unless you're a pro really. i'm still finding features i didn't realise it had.
very easy to use, i had to play with it a lot to get the feel of it ,in all very good !
it is not the smallest compact camera, but i didn't expect it to be small wih a 14x optical lens and large screen.
all the features of an slr. great image quality and zoom + excellent additional features such a fish eye lens. in screen instructions to help with usage.
the image quality is fantastic. you can really notice the difference in mega pixels. great digital zoom as well
zoom and picture quality.
a wonderful camera, easy to use and great reproduction.
amazing zoom and excellent photo quality, even in poor light.
focussing is better than the nikon coolpix p100 26x which i have.  fits in the pocket too.  i like the manual focus which enlarges part of the screen
good quality images for a compact camera. once you get the settings right you can happily use it on full auto, semi auto or manual. built in flash is suitable for most uses. lens goes from fairly wide to super zoom (~28mm-400mm in 35mm terms). overall this is a suitable replacement for my dslr when a slr is too big to carry.
excellent value for money - lots of nice features
excellent quality of photo
easy to use, good functionality. takes amazing photos on manual setting as long as you know how to use it.
i found the camera very easy to use just needed to focus and click, all information came up on the screen so did not need to keep looking at the booklet.
a versatile camera, which is very easy to use.
my 'main' camera is a pentax k-m dslr, but i often find it too bulky to lug about, which is why i wanted a good quality compact to go with it. i was attracted to the sx210 is by the long lens and good reviews, so i took the plunge. i never use the 'auto iso' setting, as higher isos always have too much of a negative effect on picture quality. set to iso 80, the picture quality is so good in good light, that it is almost on a par with my pentax. considering the sensor on the pentax is around 13 times bigger than on the canon, this is a quite astonishing result and significantly better than any other compact with a similar size sensor that i have ever owned. i have always found the 'in camera special effects' to be a waste of time in the past, but several on the sx210 is are genuinely good and combined with that long telephoto lens, really makes we want to get out and find things to photograph in a way i haven't felt for a while now, which is great.
value for money.very light, zoomable and sleek model.excellent image quality.14 mega pixel and 14x optical, it is amazing model.
small enough to put in bag. good zoom. easy  auto use.f
zoom lens 14x and wide lens, easy to use menu.
it was bought as a present for our daughter - she loves the large screen and the fantastic zoom power
fantastic zoom
excellent zoom feature
i am absolutely smitten with my new camera and would reccommend it to enyone who is an amateur, but would like to learn and take good pictures.
very easy to use and excellent image quality. i am a fan of canon ixus but this powershot has been fantastic. i thought the flash would annoy me as it pops up but it has been fine.
very easy to use,very good features
image quality very good
all you need in a camera, simple to use, great picture
simple to set up and ready for immediate use, excellent zoom/focusing
well made,seems easy to setup
simple to use.   the automatic lens cover is a great feature as it means no separate cap to keep hold of.   the panorama featuere is also very easy to use and very effective.
the photographs taken on auto are fantastic. very few red eye photos and the quality of the prints from the camera is great. i havent had time to read any of the book so just put it to auto and point and shoot - took fantastic photos of our daughter's wedding. would thoroughly recommend it. i have always used canon ixus cameras and still have an ixus 915 which is a great wee camera and i was worried about this one being a lot bulkier. it is not a problem and the quality of the photos make any difference in size irrelevant.
zoom is the best feture
excellent features in a compact digital camera. the powerful 14x optical zoom is rivaless in this class of cameras. the disign is also very attractive. probably the best compact digital camera for this price range.
almost idiot proof.!!! flash on left corner not a problem. smart looking. information comes up on screen on back.pictures look great.
zoom
as good as a big slr
very compact for amount of features. extremely easy to use. well built and feels really sturdy.
excellent pictures as you expect from a cannon. clear and sharp. i particular like the fact you can change from auto setting to manual and that adds another dimension to the camera.
good zoom
good image quality, manual control (though i havent had the need to use much so far), great zoom. the flash is not really so much of a problem as people tend to pose in some of the reviews, you just get used to it...
size, weight, zoom, video. lots of features in a small package. li-on battery so i don't need to keep purchasing batteries. manual controls.
the battery could use for a long time
great zoom,nice and compact, lots of features, looks great. fantastic screen.
hi zoom and manual settings
long zoom
long zoom
love it. image quality is great and it's very easy to use.
very easy to use
excellant quality smal camera great for all types of use
just what i was looking for a camera that is portable and not too chunky but still including all features i would like from other cannon cameras.
simple to use
picture quality is excellent, build is solid, only used a few times so not fully tested
i bought a 8gb card and this will give me over 350 piccies before full - more than enough for all trips really. more likely to run out of battery power before running out of image capability.
easy to use, but also has lots of gadgets for those who are looking for a little more in a camera. the camera itself feels good quality and its appearence is good. the picture quality is excellent and i think its value for money.
fantastic capabilities
not much experience yet, but i like the big zoom and the small size to fit in one's pocket. and many features which i am looking forward to using. excellent price
point and shoot camera that adapts to it's current environment to take the best possible picture.
takes great quality pictures as soon as you press the button( no delay or lots of flashes)
good zoom facility and easy to use on auto.
quality. good solid build, nice feel.full manual but can revert to full auto.good battery life. nice resolution.
excellent image quality, 14 x optical zoom on a compact camera is just amazing, hd video quality is better than my hd camcorder
quality of images and zoom
easy to use zoom is great

great camera for point and shooting, has the ability to do more if neededn i bought this mainly for the price and i like metal casings.
-looks professional
- pretty
so many features, the image quality is fantastic and it is definitely worth my money. i was a little hesitant that the camera itself looks like a disposable but i've eventually fallen in love with it. a definite great buy!
easy to point and shoot from the beginners instructions which were only a couple of pages long
a nice camera
brilliant image quality, special effects are amazing and a really good all round camera, on par with an slr
small and compact, but still great pictures which is what a camera is all about. a***

capture is very nice.
cheap at price. zoom good for both telephoto and wide angle.
i really like the fact that it is automatically focusing on faces or main features (smart auto) in the frame as you are sorting out the snap you want to take.
amazing depth in the photo's - feel like you could walk into them - for the price this is a truly magnificent piece of kit.  video not bad either
small compact and large screen
ease of use and image quality
very good quality pictures, no fancy features but has everything needed on an everyday camera hence makes it very easy to use fantastic camera at a very good price.

the size of the screen - excellent
excellent control options
fabulous compact digital camera.  great set of features - from point and shoot automatic through to completely manual.  controls are all logical.  one month in and i'm still finding new features.
solid build quality.
small, well made and an excellent backup to a dslr. on the basis that the best camera is the one you have with you, this is one that can easily fit into a shirt pocket or handbag, and for a compact, it takes excellent pictures. the ring around the lens is a real benefit for changing aperture, iso etc. intuitive and very easy to set up.
wide angle lens
truely value for money.
picture quality excellent for a compact camera.  i especially like the night time function which allows you to get a clear picture without a tripod as it takes multiple shots.  i'm not very clued up on all the different functions but after playing around with it whilst on my honeymoon i've worked out quite a bit and got some really high quality pictures in different settings.
great image quality on photos and videos
excellent for night photograpy with its high apperture. a very good camera if you dont want to bring your bulky dslr with its manual functions. i really like the built and the thumb grip.
this camera for a dslr users who wants an everyday take everywhere camera with advanced features
easy to use straight out of the box but not at the cost of limited capability. clear controls. excellent bright display. good pc software.
programmes available. haven't tried the movie function yet..
brilliant camera and quite light as per its capabilities and quality ...

as above
the best quality in a very small size
lightweight, pocket size, manual options present, easy upload with a usb cable to any computer. doesnot need specific programmes.
auto is easy to use
fits easily into pocket or bag.
the image quality and colours produced surprised me, and i've been using canon gear form25 years.
tous
compact and very handy. point and shoot that's all you need. pictures quality is amazing. plus point: shoot it raw!
+ nice movies
i read a lot of reviews about this camera and every one said how good the picture quality is. my previous camera - nikon coolpix p100 - the colour quality was very poor. i am delighted at the colour quality of this camera. i am still finding my way about the menu's, but so far i am impressed.
such quality and features in one tiny product
plenty of features
compactness means quality
simple to use, picture quality nearly as good as my eos, small, lightweight and easy to carry.
easy to use and takes good video even when zooming in
takes great pictures in auto mode, but can be set manually to take pictures with a special purpose in mind.
24mm wide angle lens.
all the features you would need in a camera that also shoots raw.
s mode for those grab shots - but can go creative when you want to with all the overrides.  wanted a pocketable alternative to lugging the slr round on a family holiday coming up.  fits the bill perfectly.
easy to operate strraight from the box
rear dial click-stop now - better than the s90
excellent compact camera
great lens, very easy to use.
great pictures.
small, compact and solid design
everything. just such a classy camera!!!!
compact form factor for an impressive array of capabilities. very good in low light.
amazing picture quality and the auto mode is just simple superb
compact, quick, f2, gps,
with the camera sorting out the settings for itself, and you can control what the camera does if you want to.  the camera is compact and seems well built.  overall it is an excellent package.
viewfinder - 2.7 inch lcd screen - general handling i.e. easy to get a good grip; the raised area on the front is ideally shaped for you to lock your index finger on.   this also acts as an anchor and helps keep the camera steady.
the picture quality is good too.
easy to use and user friendly
i bought this as a handy compact camera that would supplement my more expensive, and larger, cameras. as it is, i believe, the only compact camera with an optical viewfinder in current production, this was the only choice i had. being of a certain age, i find using cameras with only a display screen a great nuisance. get reading glasses out every time you want to take a picture is hopeless. the canon is light, simple to use and produces acceptable results.
really is a point-and-shoot camera in easy mode.  macro pics are well-focussed and look really professional. liked the structure of user manual i.e. the basic easy stuff in a small instruction book, plus the more complicated info. on disc.  that way you don't have to search through reams of text for the answer to a simple query.
lots of good features and found it easy to use. images like all canons are top notch.
excellent quality pictures from uch a cheap camera. has a usable view finder when needed. very easy to use menu system. uses standard aa or aa rechargeable batteries. video quality is outstanding.
nice compact camera with the advantage of having a view finder for looking through as well as the screen. this is very convenient when the sun is shining brightly and makes it very difficult to actually see anything on the screen.
bought for my wife who just loves it.
4) great price
having used a compact with only a screen which was useless in bright light, i looked for one with a viewfinder. this one does not dissapoint. although quite small, the viewfinder is all that's necessary, so much so that i only use it instead of the screen.   the main purpose of having a canera is to take pictures and this one takes good ones. the sharpness and colour are as good as i have seen. the quality of movies puts some camcorders to shame. the movie capacity depends on the memory card. there are more features on the camera than i am likely to use, but the layout makes selection easy. the main control wheel is positioned so you are unlikely to move it accidentally while in your pocket (or handbag) the a1200 ticks most of the boxes for a compact. for me, the decider was the viewfinder.
very useful view finder, my elderly mother finds it alot easier to use as had trouble with traditional digital cameras.
the view finder is invaluable in very bright conditions and i like the use of aa batteries (which you can pick up almost anywhere in the world). good quality photos and very easy to use. excellent camera.
viewfinder invaluable for bright sunny conditions, (doesn't happen often in uk), but great for foreign holidays when i take 90% of my photos anyway.  have been a fan of canon for years and have several powershot slr's (still all in working order). love the date displays and versatility of a1200.  excellent.
viewfinder, nice design, simple layout, solid buttons and switches, takes aa batteries, brand name reputation.
fantastic point and shoot camera with excellent results
viewfinder incorporated. uses aa batteries.
the camera is quite rugged, simple to use and the great thing is it runs on ordinary aa batteries.
very easy to use in auto mode and has user modes when more creativity and control is desired.
compact and easy to handle.  viewfinder as well as screen is useful.
as a retired person the most important feature is the eye viewfinder.this is a very important feature for my peer group and since my acquistion a number of my friends have indicated an interest in purchasing this model solely because of htis feature.
it's very easy to use and takes care of all the technical stuff itself, just as i want it.  it's really nice to hold, and a brilliant camera at a great price.
very easy to use, ideal point and shoot camera.
realistic colours, nice picture quality, compact.
good little camera with a basic viewfinder - lots of functions a nd nice photos for the price - be realistic don't expect dslr photos : )
very pleased with the product
a nice easy to use pocket camera with a viewfinder, so the screen can be switched off to save the batteries (i use re-chargeables).  can usually get good results with program mode.  not as well made as some, but doesn't feel as though it will break with normal use.  battery life is quite good and it uses standard aa batteries.
lightweight, has a viewfinder for difficult light conditions, has good wide angle - better than older models
an excellent starter option, and a good cheap camera small enough to carry around at all times for pictures of opportunity ( the pictures are good enough, losing or wrecking it are only a small disaster).
the optical viewfinder is indspensable forshooting in bright sunshine, despite a good screen image.  the use of readily available aa batteries avoids the dependance on a power supply when traveling in remote areas.  both features, which i consider essential, are not offered by many manufacturers.
the camera is very easy to use, with quite a few interesting features (although i prefer to use the auto-setting). the viewfinder is also useful and i chose this camera partly because it's one of the few to use aa batteries.
the canon a1200 has an optical viewfinder which is very rare on a compact camera so is excellent in strong sunlight
this camera has a viewfinder, which most point-and-shoot digital cameras lack. it makes a world of difference to what can be done in bright sunlight, when the screen is virtually useless.
rotary dial for selection of mode, unlike the ixus 75 where the slide switch could be moved when inserting or reving from the carry case. theviewinder is a good feature, especially in that the optical zoom view is provided.
light and very compact so easy to slip into a pocket or handbag. takes very good pictures and downloads quickly.
it has a view finder, which is a boon to anyone having to wear glasses, who wants to take a quick snap.
an excellent camera that produces the goods. is pocketable and above all it has a viewfinder --top marks to canon and it is excellent value for the money.a great little back up camera.
programs
it has a viewfinder which is invaluble in bright sunny weather. fits easily in ones pocket. needed something handy to just point and shoot without having to take a camera bag with me everytime.
very easy to use.
cracking little camera that has exactly what i wanted.  it has a simple setting which guides you through how to use it as you learn all about the new toy.  not too costly, lovely picture quality.  i read that it had a cheap plastic bulky body - completely disagree, yes it's plastic but it's a good buy.  completely understand why it was a which top product.
brilliant little camera
viewfinder allows use in strong light and also with screen turned off to prolong battery life in remote location.
compact size
very easy to use and takes lovely pictures,its even quite good in low light,the viewfinder is a big plus. highly recommended
great features and flexibility; very good image quality for the price; has a viewfinder too (regard this as vital in some lighting conditions).
no 1 priority for me - has a viewfinder.  small, fits in a pocket/handbag.  takes good pictures in ideal conditions - light and preferably outdoors.  aa batteries so easy to carry spares and don't need power source to recharge.  nice little camera for 'snaps' but a bit disappointing for anything more complex.  next camera with viewfinder is much more expensive and complicated.
nice compact camera wih good features. very good image quality. helpful to have the viewfinder but quite small. good fun playing around with the different settings i.e monochrome, fish eye lens etc. haven't used the video yet so can't comment on that aspect.
close to the 'ideal' digital point-and-shoot for most users. i use the camera as a back-up to my canon 450d.
easy to use
viewfinder - the reason i bought this camera as i find it impossible to use screen in bright conditions.
for me in sunny or very bright conditions); aa batteries (readily available almost everywhere); the various modes make it suitable for most occasions/requirements.
view finder
optical viewfinder! very rare on a camera of this price, but it means you can take pics in sunlight when others are struggling and squinting at screens! well done canon. perfect and pocketable. love it.
not too expensive, compact and light. moulded slightly so it can be held securely when taking shots.
this is my first digital camera and i find it very easy to use.  the view finder is excellent for taking pictures on the beach etc in bright sunshine.
i've been pleased with the results i've had so far and it's nice to handle
good sized screen,optical viewfinder for when it's to bright to see the screen properly,camera sounds can be customised, eg volume level.
it is easy to use, it has a viewfinder and ordinary batteries are a good idea because then you don't have to worry about getting them charged.
has a viewfinder and for someone who wears glasses life is so much easier
viewfinder and all round quality though i've only had camera for a short time
viewfinder focuses with zoom
point and shoot with good results. had cameras in the past with lots of funtions and hardly used them.being able to zoom on video is a plus. aa batteries. view finder
great camera, does exactly what it shouldm have tried others but always go back to cannon. even my husband who is more pro user than me is impressed with this camera. you can't go wrong.
very good macro facility, excellent quality sharp close ups of insects etc.  lightweight, small, packed with features. autofocus is quick and accurate. amazing value
. though not my main camera it means i can always have a camera with me. quality is good enough for most purposes as long as i don't want very large prints.
great camera, really easy to use.
the eye level viewfinder.
fair quality in relation to price. easy to use and for the use i want, perfect. i was looking for a cheap easy to use camera and i believe this fits the bill.
viewfinder/ ease of use
easy to handle, daylight picture quality is really good.
view finder
picture quality is excellent. ovferall a very good camera at a bargain price.
i bought it for my 11 year old, but wished i'd had one on a recent trip as lugging the dslr around was a pain at times! and where i would have need a \xa3300 telephoto lens on the dslr this camera was able to zoom in and focus sharply.
this is a canon an d like all canons it has a glass lens which gives sharp pictures. it is very compact and pocketable. very easy to use. i would describe this as an excellent beginners camera. it has an opticle viewfinder which is usually only available on expensive slr/bridge cameras.
has optical viewfinder (useful for someone like me who needs glasses to see a camera screen). takes pictures nearly as good as my digital slr camera.  extremely cheap for a top quality camera. without it's case, it easily fits my pockets.
stagering image quality for the money - i have some great a4 prints already.....
i wanted something small and portable with good resolution - mainly to photograph meeting notes from wallcharts/whiteboards, as smartphone cameras just don't give the clarity. i got some nice close up shots of the bird that tried to steal my crisps in the new forest
compared to my wifes more powerful compact camera this is as good
good value for the money
excellent price
with an optical viewfinder
value for money.
great value for money.
good brand.  it runs on batteries and so useful backup for my rechargeable camera.  lots of features.  great value for money.
fantastic! takes great quality photos, is compact and has a lot of good effects. seems like it should be more expensive, would definitely reccomend!
light and easy to use and was affordable for a csnon
viewfinder is great when you are in bright sunlight
view finder, aa batteries
very easy to use and oh so easy to understand the instructions for use. i replaced my sony cybershot with this camera not disapointed .good value ,good price
it has a proper viewfinder!
it has a viewfinder!!!!  i'd almost given up hope of finding a compact camera with a viewfinder.  i use a canon slr for most photography, but like to have a compact in my handbag. screens are hopeless in bright sun.  i was so pleased to discover that canon produces a  compact with a viewfinder - and at a reasonable price, too!
lightweight, has view finder,
great that batteries can be used-useful if you have ever forgotten a camera charger on holiday !!
cannon powershot  excellent compact camera a++++
uses aa batteries always available and works well on good quality rechargeable batteries. lots of good preset shooting modes.
has a viewfinder.  quick to start up.  runs best on re-chargable batteries.
has a viewfinder but a rather small one.

very pleased with the camera, excellent value for money, easy to use, viewfinder, aa bateries, excellent image quality.
easy to use,great to have a view finder,software is good.
easy to use, a viewfinder for those bright days
lens, build quality and features are good for the price. and it has a viewfinder - one of the main reasons i bought it.
viewfinder. i only use the display when necessary and use lithium batteries, they seem to last for ever. using the viewfinder also makes it a lot easier to steady the camera. size makes it an excellent pocket camera, i keep it in a sock type case and take it everywhere.
easy to use and bwat size - view finder good in sunny weather
easy to use, compact size for pocket.
the view finder.  i wanted a digital camera with viewfinder, not many available at reasonable price.  this one does the job.
a viewfinder - how many compacts have one? have just returned from a holiday with a lot of sunshine, the screen was useless, and all 200-odd pictures were taken through the viewfinder. the a1200 is worth the price for that alone. altogether a nice camera to use, if just a bit slow.
viewfinder useful, especially in bright light conditions. easy to use straight out of the box. fun special-effects. large monitor.
i bought it because it had a viewfinder and i could easily take photos in sunny conditions when i could not see the screen and so far am finding the camera excellent!!
viewfinder
first camera of this size that i have found with a viewfinder, a very good feature in bright sunlight.
shoot, as used by my wife, works well.
very vesatile. the viewfinder is an important feature for us.
viewfinder
small, lightweight and easy to handle.  i bought this camera because it also had a viewfinder which was essential for me.  i am very pleased with the quality of the photographs and i like the wider angled lens.
big bang for the buck. easy to use. quality photos.
i bought this camera because it had an optical viewfinder having only just abandoned film cameras.it is well built small and light and i like the ability to recall your picture on the large clear screen and cancel all the dud shots.the pictures are good and crisp too.the price, considering all the facilities is more than reasonable.
viewfinder
when you look through the optical viewfinder you can see the end of the lens, has no effect on the picture but it is off-putting
viewfinder, aa batteries
take photos, reasonably intuitive
uses aa batteries. viewfinder extremely useful. good range of shooting options and settings. excellent pocket camera for me.
got a viewfinder
has a viewfinder
viefinder, small size
very compact, and with an optical viewfinder for shooting on bright days. using aa size ready available batteries is great, both at home and away. my wife is thrilled with her canon powershot a550, the name canon says it all.
bought this for my elderly mum who just wants a point and shoot but with a viewfinder (this is the main selling point) very good value for money.
compact, easy to carry, easy to use for a  novice
takes good photos even when used by a novice.
small and compact

its really handy for home, weekends party etc
the viewfinder!  so useful on bright days
ease of use for someone who is an anti techno.
really nice little point and shoot camera. i bought it because it has a view finder as well as the display screen as i sometimes find it difficult to see the image on the screen (e.g. in bright / dark conditions).  have read some reviews saying the battery life is short, but i haven't experienced any problems.
at last a camera you can use properly with a view finder wonderful
seems robust, i`ve alreadt dropped it and it seemed to bounce rather well.  comes on quickly and closes quickly
qquick and easy

well worth the small amount of money i paid for it. obviously the more you pay the better the camera! great to actually find a camera with a view finder.
have used it for the past 9 days in singapore and vietnam approx 80 exposures a lot with the flash ,put 2 new duracel bats in to go and still working on return print quality looks good . have rechargable aa s if needed..would recomend
great photos taken, brilliant quality and good value for money
i bought this camera for my wife who can't stand trying to see what her camera was looking at when the sun shines! the viewfinder although small is perfectly adequate for holiday snaps and the picture quality seems fine to me. i had read some reviews which said the quality was not good but it's better than my more expensive olympus.
a great pocket-sized back up for (or alternative to) to your slr.
the camera is easy to use and has lots of good functions which enable you to take better quality pictures and movies so overall its a really good camera.
viewfinder
view finder
i always buy canon and this is an excellent budget digital, handy for carrying around at all times, when my normal canon slr is inconvenient.
ease of use....plenty of pixels for a quality picture......but mainly, an eye lvel view finder
bought for elderly relative wanting basic camera with viewfinder, so this was just about the only one that fitted that requirement.  also, using aa batteries makes it easy for her to buy new ones without having to worry about buying the right ones.  more features than needed so the basic 'set and forget' setting is an excellent idea.

optical viewfinder is usefull in bright conditions. some good creative effects to have fun with. uses aa batteries which are available anywhere.

good quality photos.compact size. fair amount of features. good value online.
basic creative features to help advancement in digital photography.

viewfinder - the chief reason i chose this camera, and it does everything else well.

optical viewfinder. aa batteries.
it has a view finder!  viewfinders are hard to get in this type of camera - i therefore bought 2 'a 1200's.
the use of standard aa batteries is brill. i feel relieved from the tyrrany of a specific battery needing a specific charger. this will be an ideal camera for electricity free camping holidays.
a decent camera, at a reasonable price, with a viewfinder - invaluable in bright sunlight.
optical viewfinder
optical viewfinder - aa batteries - single hand operation is easy
nice and compact, easy to use, but also has extra features if you are more knowledgeable. the macro feature is excellent. i used to have a canon a1,many years ago and am looking forward to playing with this more...
fast start up. good autofocus. bright images. neat styling.
view finder to help see what you are framing when it is a bright day
compact, light-weight and takes great pictures in low light. impressive zoom and no annoying pop-up flash. cool colour and smart metal body. easy to follow menus and clear screen.
i bought this as a camera to take travelling and provide me with first class photos without having endless features that i don't know how to use. the ixus 230 is excellent in all respects. small, light and compact, and cuts to the chase by removing a lot of the manual features that the majority of us don't know how to use, without sacrificing picture quality. would definitely recommend.
easy to take quality photos. looks good. feels robust
perfect pictures, great colours, great manual options
superb image quality for a (relatively) cheap compact.  low light performance is excellent.  plenty of scene modes and the ability to make some limited manual adjustments if you want to.  slow motion video is absolutely amazing and the main reason i chose this camera
the camera is nice, sleek and stylish. i got it in the colour blue and it looks amazing. it takes good quality pictures and its got great camera modes. this is my first personal camera and its pretty decent.
overall a very easy to use camera. we have a digital slr and wanted a small camera to slip into a pocket. this camera meets our needs exactly.
really high quality images in low light conditions. large viewing screen and accurate face recognition. hd video is also really nice too!
auto scene selector and facial recognition.
excellent camera and made a great present for the wife.  she wanted a camare that would take good photos in low light and this works well.
only had it for a month but what i have seen so far: the many features and functions are surprisingly simple to use. it produces excellent image quality, indoor even 'very good' without flash. the metal casing gives it a robust feeling.
bought to replace ageing pentax which which didn't always focus in low light situations, but you couldn't always tell on the tiny screen. this camera focuses sharply every time no matter what the light levels are and the size of the screen gives a very good indication of the photo quality.
just a fabulous point and shoot camera. absolutely love it and have had some stunning photos of a range of subjects since buying it less than a month ago. amazing
small, good image quality, fast, great zoom for such a small camera, great price.  as this model is now not the newest, you don't pay for the unnecessary gimmicks such as 16mp and wi-fi that newer ones have, but you still get a great camera.  a significant step up from all phone cameras.
fabulous camera, very easy to use and small enough for your pocket.
compact, easy to use
good image quality in low light conditions eg gigs
small, neat and great images
this is a great little camera. compact, light-weight and very handy for popping in your bag or pocket. i upgraded from the ixus 120 recently, which i took with me anytime i went anywhere interesting. it's perfect as a 'point and shoot' camera, although the 230 hs has plenty of other features. the movie facility is handy for capturing street scenes, events, people etc. highly recommended.
there have been criticisms of its controls, but they follow the previous canon style and i don't have any problem with them.
qual of image massive improvement on what i had before.
solidly built, good image quality, clear large screen
very quick startup, video button great idea, really pleaseed with it
a very easy to use small compact camera which is ideal for everyday use. good images on both prints and video
the picture quality is really good, even compared with a previous canon ixus.  i haven't looked at all the features available as just wanted to take some snaps and it did the job brilliantly.  very happy with my purchase.
easy to use pretty much intuitive controls.
perfect for casual photography, although i have used on some olympic sporting events and it coped well.
reasonable price
excellent value easy to use.
the camera itself is also very aesthetically pleasing to look at, and for who want it, the camera is available in a range of colours.
not had a chance to do very much with it yet - still getting to know my way round the functions.
bought for a parent who didn't want anything too complicated, no complaints
easy and portable camera, well worth the money. you can even mute it so you don't get all the annoying sounds!
excellent colours, flash brilliant and nice and small
lots of different styles of shot taking and feels like you can take photoshop pictures right there.happy it does what it says on the tin kinda thing
compact. easy to slip into pocket or handbag. great zoom.
lightweight and small
very easy to use,lovely clear photos
very  compact and lightweight
great image quality, fast power on time so ready to take photos very quickly, slow motion video for fun shots of bomb diving a pool! good zoom at x8 but with digital zoom too you can get really close to the action without too much depreciation in quality.  very neat and smart camera.
stylish design, a wealth of functionalities and, most important, quickly ready to take a picture.

easy to use, good compact size that easily fits into the pocket.  good screen size.  very good for point and shoot photos if that is the requirement.  quick to set up and start using.  battery lasts well.
so good for such a small camera!
very good battery life before recharging needed.
good quality photos, easy to use.
compact and easy to use
for a hassle free just point and shoot camera this ticks all the right boxes no more are the days for getting home and kicking you self and thinking only if
quick and easy to use.
this camera has a good lens to match a high resolution sensor (12 mp cmos), which together produce great photos (and movies). and for the price, brilliant value.
takes great photos, small, compact and easy to use!:)
great all rounder at the price to keep in your pocket.
read lots of reviews before purchasing this for my daughter for christmas. excellent build and image quality, fits in my daughters hand bag as she wanted it instead of all ways carrying around her digital slr. more than happy as excellent camera for a very good price.
love the multi focus feature it really helps.
every thing about it is good what else is there to say.
this a very smart looking camera and very compact. it has a large screen and produces very clear shots without having to manually intervene........ and all at a very very reasonable price.
each of my three daughter have one, ages 12 to 16. they experiment with the features and have great fun. great pictures and features, at this price great value.
when you find your way around the canon menu.
small and compact, but feels sturdy and well made.

brilliant pictures and fairly easy to use when you are a novice.  there seems to be a lot of features available for the camera enthusiast too which for the novice is maybe a bad point.. see below...
compact camera
excellent camera and value for money as you would expect from canon.
easy to use
small enough to carry in a suit pocket, good low light resolution, point and shoot but has plenty of manual settings. remains in focus when zooming whilst using video, unlike some other brands.

long battery life, good zoom, easy to use, lots of features and great price.
generally good in all aspects for my purpose
very pleased
(i don't know why canon has discontinued this camera after a short production life because it seems to be better than its replacement.)
build quality, speed, size of screen
excelent picture quality
great images. great video.
compact, easy to use, looks good
small and compact. easy to use as i previously owned a canon ixus and many of the features are easy to use, and in some respects they are even easier on the ixus 230 hs compact digital camera. i tend to use mine for close up, normal and zoomed in images. good viewing display and larger than on my previous camera.
easy to use and good quality photos. used as point and shoot for a 2 week hols and most shots look spot on.

everything
simple to use-good all round
i bought this camera because it has an optical viewfinder - but i have found it to be an excellent performer, especially at the price
i owned the canon powershot a1200, but unfortunately it was stolen.  i was so pleased with it and now they have brought the a1300 out i purchased this model.  having a viewfinder is a definite plus.
brilliant to have view finder as well as screen
optical veiwfinder makes it easy to use in any light conditions also i find it the most natural way to hold a camera steady.

not being very technically minded, this camera is so simple to use, easy to read menus and that must have view finder for those of us who just cannot see screens in bright sunlight.
having had a small digital camera previously to this one i found it fairly easy to use
it's not too complicated, i got it for my mother's 80th birthday!!
simple, easy to use good for oldies.
small and light enough for my pocket and a small handbag.   it does all i ask of it, but does not replace my 2 expensive (but heavy) olympus cameras.   a nice little back up and quick snap camera.
view finder makes use in bright weather much easier
copact easy to use
my goodness, this camera has crazy features that will make all you pictures unique and different every time. however it also has the clarity of a professional photography....so you will be pleased, no doubt. battery life is so good; couple hours charge will last for days!
love this camera. it takes really nice pictures as far as i've tested and is really light to hold. perfect for casual days or evenings out with friends, i haven't had a full chance to to test it out which is why that score isn't higher. when i tried it out in store i couldn't find the features and didn't think it really had any different settings for different lighting situations, aside from the flash. when i got it home though i had a browse around and found out it did, just not quite as many as other cameras, but it's often easier to pick when there aren't so many to choose from.
the camera works fine and is really simple to use.
takes good photos
easy to use, nice and compact.  excellent battery life and loaded with masses of features. superb value for money
this is a really easy-to-use camera with good outcomes.  i haven't tapped all its features yet but am impressed with all the auto settings and the battery life.
shoot camera then this wonderful budget camera would fit your needs. even without flash, the picture quality is especially superb when there's enough sunlight, while lacking a little bit during gloomy days such as winter. video quality is also great, although only at close range. zooming while videoing is available but will make the video quality grainy and blurry, hence is less favourable.
really pleased with it so far. easy to figure out and simple to use - just what i wanted!
solid build and no complicated features for anyone who just wants to point and shoot.
easy to use
easy to use, very small.

great camera
i havnt played around with the features yet so didnt mark it higher
image quality is superb and good features from point and shoot to more creative photography
very comfortable to hold. simple to use as a point and shoot but has extra features if required, that i will explore  once  i am more familiar with the camera.   love the 20x zoom.  much better build than a similar fujji camera that i purchased and then returned from another supplier earlier this year.
versatile and easy to use.
canon sensor
comfortable in the hand ,auto makes it easy to use
picture quality is excellent in my opinion.  there are so many features available i am still working my way through them all, so far so good. the g.p.s does work, it located the pictures to within a couple of metres of location although the tracking doesn't seem to follow the actual route taken when displayed on pc.   maybe i just don't fully understand it yet!   the camera feels solid and well built.  the price i paid was great value, i don't think i would have paid full price.  for me the camera does all i want.
a compact camera which does everything i want it to. it has a brilliant zoom - although a little 'fuzzy' at full zoom. the camera looks good and i found it very easy to get started. i took children having fun and it coped with the movement well. i haven't yet tried the video and there are a lot of other features which i haven't had chance to look at yet!
ease of use and quality of image
all the bells and whistles and a canon camera.  i wanted a camera with a good zoom to take photos of architectural features on large buildings.
just seems very good all round except ...
good zoom and clear pictures, hd video. easy to use and advanced for experienced photographers.
excellent quality images in a lovely, compact camera with a lot of features
ease of use good picture quality good screen

instantly easy to use
very good image quality and great zoom. some good useful features and manual controls.
features are the same s larger canon soo it is easy to adapt.
i bought this for my wife who is always disappointed with the pictures from her camera phone and so far she has been impressed with the image quality and the various settings
easy to hold, dead easy to use and looks good. shop-around for cases most are way to big and clumsy.
light, convenient to carry, excellent zoom for small cam
good picture.early days to try all modes but the ones ive tried work well.
excellent value.   well built. very easy to use. good features with ability to use in prog and manual modes as well as auto
easy to use, very good image quality, great value for money, gps.
really good camera. has a great frame and the zoom works well for all kinds of shots near and far. the quality of the images are also amazing. for a semi-professional camera, i would definitely recommend this product.
small,portable and with many features found on much more expensive cameras. good value.
'macro'. still getting to grips with other features. pictures so far have been great, even at night.  huge improvement on previous camera (pentax). would highly recommend particularly for a casual user like me.
i have had a canon before and i am equally thrilled with the 206.  easy to use and quality photos.

takes good quality photos for the type of camera it is. it has an excellent zoom.
clear pictures, gps is good.
excellent still image quality. movie quality also very good. anti-shake works well on long zoom. well built and simple layout of controls. with a good class 10 card, the shot to shot time is reasonably quick. battery life good. small enough to carry anywhere, but still big enough to provide decent handling. this is my third canon in this series.
would recommend it as a good camera for beginners and also for more advances users.
easy to use
easy to use
easy to use and seems quite sturdy. the price was the main selling point for me. seems a good quality camera for the money but i have not used it much yet. time will tell.
i wanted a bit more than a point and shoot, and also small enough to put in my bag, but big enough i could actually hold it and press the buttons.  so after looking at several cameras we came up with this model.  so far i am very pleased with it, and the picture quality seems very good.  there are also enough programmes to make it interesting to experiment with but not so complicated to put you off.
zoom, tracking, separate video button
features and value for money

a brilliant camera for the money. i especially like the 20x zoom.

stm manual focus is veryyy nice touch also - again much better than expected and the build quality of camera and lens is really nice
plenty of controls i have not yet explored
brilliant product - so many features and possibilities
excellent in every way, can't say more.

intuitive product, easy connectivity for sharing pictures and movies
excellent en photo et video
versatile lens with good build quality
excellent features, good video camera function
great modern camera.  touch screen helps as can focus on the exact point of interest
easy to use, smooth and quiet lens, many features and great pictures
easy to use but has the option to go to manual setting gradually. useful for me being a dslr novice :)
good value for money
video recording with good autofocus
lens has great range.
feels comfortable to handle, not heavy, range of add ons, tilt and turn lcd, does everything except make the tea! great mid range camera for those trading up, or someone like me who is going back to more control the dslr's give, but not wanting full professional model!
light, 5fps, vari angle screen useful for taking photo's from different angles, info on the screen for what each setting does useful for beginners and people who haven't used all the settings on their dslr, image quality good and high megapixel means you can crop pictures and still have good resolution. touch screen functions.
very easy to use automatic mode, excellent range of features and settings for the more adventurous/experienced types. whilst the supplied lens is basic it is more than adequate for a starter kit and good value as a bundle, image stabilization and auto focus are a must for photos. free kit bag is very useful!
my first dslr so i'm a novice with it regards to how to use all the functions. there's a lot this camera can do and i don't see the need to change this for a very long time as the features seem to cover everything.
lots of features and excellent quality photos mean you can give every picture your own personal touch.
superb picture quality, intuitive to use especially with the touch screen monitor, lightweight and huge range of features.
this is really a good product that fulfill my desire on photography and video graphy.
out of the box this camera takes very good pictures. the touch screen is easy to use once mastered. the wide range of options on the controls should enable an experienced photographer to take great pictures
to it
suprisingly the touch screen, it thought this would be gimicy but it actually works really well, it lets you navigate though the menus a lot quicker. i was looking at this or the 60d and i made the right choice for me, its so much lighter and with the new digic5 it has a few extra features and specs that put it on a par. lets you edit in the camera, has a clever hdr backlight control feature which does all the hardwork for you when taking over/under exposed shots. the battery life lasts all day for a couple of days full use, recomend having a spare though no matter which camera you buy. gave this camera 8/10 as i'm sure there are better cameras out there for a lot more money, but within its price range you wouldn't go wrong chosing this camera.
the video feature is excellent.
an excellent all round camera for the am/pro! it has lots of good features and tells you what they do as you select them, this makes it very user friendly! the flip screen is brilliant for tripod work!
great value for this amazing camera. it is easy to use and takes excellent photos.
plenty of features to keep you entertained....with easy focus for that quick photo opportunity
great range of shooting modes. picture quality is stunning and ease of use after some initial learning is a delight. unusually with todays products is that it also comes with a pocket sized complete manual - highly recommended.
excellent images may be obtained by simply setting the camera to 'scene intelligent auto'.
nice clear display with a pretty good touch screen
very good camera, lightweight and easy to use.
high quality images with top end sensor
brilliant pictures! what more could you want!
versatile, excellent interchangeable lens, many functions

excellent
the best dslr camera for beginners
i'ts a canon...... :-)
great quality for focus.
fast enough
you can use it out of the box on automatic and/or get very technical if you want.   excellent picture quality.
i particularly like the touch screen and the fact that it folds over when not in use so less chance of getting damaged.
the camera has lots of good features, but you can just use it straight away to get good results just have it all set to auto, like the touch screen it\x92s great fun.
good price, weight, simplicity of use
5) easy to take photo's with

well balanced and light weight
seems like a great camera although i'm a novice and only just getting to grips with it.
screen a pleasure.
great so far
easy to use. excellent image quality
superb dslr and not much to improve on.
ive had several canon powershot cameras this is the best yet.very good pictures from such a small camera.also the vidio is superb.
manual controls; fast processor and excellent image quality
appears solidly built and the results are superb
small and easy to pack hand baggage on cheap fligths. allows you to take control but will make decisions for you dials well laid out low light performance excellent a serious photographers compact.
if you do street photography, this is for you!
some great features makes it a great substitute for my dslr.
i have had two g9s so the g15 is an updated version of what i am used to.  it has a faster lens, which is great, and is excellent for video.  i am pleased the makers still use mainly metal in its construction, so it is more rugged than its rivals.  also pleased to see canon returning to a fixed screen, rather than the swivel screen that has limited use and made the camera bulkier.
solid feel about camera.
good zoom and picture quality for the price and size of this camera.
which is a sign of quality.
great solid camera and although i know nothing about them, the image quality is brilliant and perfect for promotional work.
good manual (on dvd or download) - did explain the options well.
wonderful quality pics even in low light, provided you set up for the pic properly. solid build, relatively compact size compared to dslr camerals.
among many others, good low light performance. very close focusing in macro.  viewfinder useful in bright sunlight. i like that the flash needs manually raising to avoid it operating without being asked.
very good value for money.
small, light, compact and incredibly good value.  a really professional camera without the weight and bulk of a dslr.
very sharp image quality, good lens, nice saturation. very nice compact camera. just buy it, you can't go wrong with canon g-series.
the g16 only has movie at 30fps hence i bought the g15
sturdy excellent quality loads of features and far more portable than a digital slr
build quality...lens quality,,,size good to handle.....
just quality
easy to use. nice size. good image quality.
great camera you can take it anywhere has a viewfinder
an amazing array of clever features, provided you can remember how to access them.  very compact and easy-to-carry with viewfinder for very bright light as well as lcd screen.
looks good
smaller and lighter than my previous g10
early days yet so i every thing seems ok
you can take several fotos without waiting for processing
easy to use
easy to use and quality of pictures
versatile bridge camera which is fast and responsive
vewfinder, and no wifi to reduce the quality of the camera, because i want a quality compact camera not a device to connect to whatever!
excellent build quality,great compact camera if you don't want to carry a bulky dslr .
small, easy to use, great aperture, built like a tank
great build quality,solid  feel.this is an ideal camera as a back for a dslr,which you don`t want to carry about on holiday,image quality is excellent in low light,and day time,sunny conditions do make it awkward to see in the lcd viewfinder,the optical one being of little use to be honest.altogether a worthy addition to any keen photographer,recommended.
all good
i wanted both view-finder and lcd display on a small (as compact as possible) camera.  this camera is perfect.
solidly built with excellent image quality.
view finder
bomb proof, fast lens, amazing image quality from such a pocketable camera, even a high iso produces a very acceptable image when run through decent (nik) noise reduction software. it's not a high end dslr and it doesn't pretend to be, what it is, is a high end compact that produces outstanding results when you're on holiday and your 5d isn't.
easy to take picture
not too heavy considering it's many facilities and options.  i look forward to using it on holiday instead of hauling my canon 7d plus lenses.  eye level viewfinder is very useful.
easy to use with menu giving explanations to items on menu
lens quality
this compact is perfect, both for the photographer who only wishes to obtain superb images from the full auto programme and for the advanced photographer who enjoys using the more creative aspects the camera has to offer.
tr\xe8s bon appareil super photos
gives very good picture quality for a compact camera; gives control over all settings making it suitable for most situations; seems to be very well made and robust; very clear screen; optical viewfinder makes it usable in situations where screen cannot be seen.
great alternative to slr
well designed.  i do like to have an optical viewfinder; there are so few compacts fitted with one these days.  this one is goodwhen the sun shines on the screen.
quality of build, awesome aperture, fast and agile, easy to carry (not the smallest but small enough for travels). quick control for exposure control. you can\xb4t go wrong with this one.
wonderful big screen
solid construction. raw capture. triple exposure captures. excellent photos.
small, fast, easy to use, low price, not heavy
low light effectiveness, ease of use, size, video ease of use and quality, and use of telephoto in videoing
ease of use and excellent results so far.  wantewd this model to replace g9 and it certainly does that.
fast belt to shoot time, everything seems quicker and sharper than my g12
solid build
small enough to pop in a pocket and take anywhere with good quality build and plenty of features.
just love it
great camera for photography enthusiasts
big enough buttons
nice compact size,great pictures,plenty of features,and it`s a canon,feels good in the hand,i`m very pleased with my purchase,hope to have it for years to come.
image quality
smaller and more pocketable than the g11/g12. the f/1.8 lens is better for low light shots and therefore (for me) the camera is more useful. the autofocus seems faster than the g12. great for close-ups/macro with amazing 1cm distance from subject. battery charge life seems to last forever. great little camera! excellent image quality and great features. video quality is amazing!
easy to use, quality, program,...
good value for money while provides all the best features needed by an enthusiast photographer. f2.8 aperture @ 140mm zoom makes a lot of difference
easy to use..great quality images. i am a commercial photographer and use to use my iphone as my main casual camera but wanted a camera that had images big enough to edit and use without the light being blown out. this camera is amazing and highly recommend it as a casual camera + it fits in your back pocket!
la qualit\xe9 de fabrication et d'image la taille qui permet de mettre le g15 dans la poche
small, useful and with many professional camera options. it's almost perfect!
light  and compact
touch screen works well; with many options clearly and easily displayed. clours vibrant and bright. this looks like a very good quality build and i am glad i chose it as a replacement for my 6 year old 400d
can be completely automated or manual settings
exceptionally versatile camera for the price.  way up there - should not be referred to as an 'entry model'. it isn't.   choose your own lens though - the kit lens is borderline.  i recommend the 17-55mm!
just a brilliant camera
great camera, excellent features. super fast shipping from these guys - very surprised after some negative reviews i'd read.
a lot of mid-range functionality in a lighter, more compact camera.
ergonomie + poid + prise en main facile + large gamme d'objectif
excellent product
video mode and touchscreen are great.
does what is says on the reviews
a terrific camera
fantastic image quality. can use all my old lenses and kit with it and it's easy to find your way around the new body. it's a great camera for a fantastic price.
competively priced
ease of use changing dial, great images and love the touch screen
this camera has everything you need.
compact size, lightness. menu system a bit long-winded sometimes.
very easy to use, the battery charged very quickly and the camera was ready to shoot within 2 hours and obtained very good results on full auto first time out. very impressed with lens quality and ease of use. there are many features and it will take sometime to discover its full capabilities. a big plus and the reason for my choice is the hd video and the ability to view through the view finder and also on the screen. very pleased with my choice.
had canon cameras all my life, had others too but have never failed with quality, ease of use. would always recommend them,
i was looking for a dslr camera for a very long time and after reading all the reviews i decided to buy the canon eos1100d, i have taken atleast 3000 pictures in the last 1 month but i havent explored the manual focus yet , i am still using the auto focus which makes life a lot easier so i am not really bothered about the manual focus and cant comment on it.when you zoom a nearby object and take a picture in auto focus mode in normal day light , the picture quality is simply mind blowing...i would definitely recommend this camera over nikon d3100 ( exactly the same spec as canon eos1100d ) as there is an option to atleast use another lens , just in case.nikon wont take any other lens...
initial lense 18-55m. i've only had the camera for 1 month, so am still finding me feet with it. however, i'm glad i made the purchase.
great entry level dslr camera.
easy to use and very lightweight.
this camera is certainly good for a starter. it has very good picture details as color and size. very easy to carry and use. good shutter speed compared to other cameras and as a beginner cam as well. battery back up is good.
great price considering there are so many features.
its my first dslr camera and i am very happy with the results.
amazing battery life, on the first charge got 2 weeks use out of it. (not using flash much though)
very good starting camera for anyone wanting to take more than quick snapshots.
decent image quality.
can use the camera like a 'point and shoot' or by looking at the display panel to take a picture.
for those of us old enough to remember film based slr cameras this reminds me of those great cameras that i never got to own. it is a lovely gift.
1st slr i have had and found it really easy to use and the image quality has been superb. i'm sure you can get better with much more expensive cameras, but with this they are great.
fool-proof prompts when using 'non-auto' features.
easy to use and great for first time buyers that need an slr to start off with
easy to use and a delight to hold.
great images intuitive menus, love it.
pic quality
easy to use, provides some excellent results, loads of available accessories, great price!
easy to setup quick and get snapping with most of if not all of the abilities as the big boys out there.
very good camera, excellent picture quality and very user friendly.
i have just upgraded to slr and i'm delighted that this canon has been so easy to use and gives superb photos.
very good camera for a beginner like me. manual very clear and fairly easy to understand. pictures are excellent both in auto mode and creative mode. highly recommended
feel, weight, pic quality, so easy to use,
easy to use for a first time dlsr user , quality of the pictures is outstanding compared to the compact digital camera i had.
easy to use even for a beginner, takes great pictures.  well pleased with it.

thoroughly enjoying this as my starter slr. enough features and adjustable settings to keep me busy for a while, and good auto-features allow the user to focus on framing without having to worry about more technical aspects all the time too.
it has hd video recording....nice
brilliant camera for a beginner.  easy to use.
good picture images
a present for my daughter who is studying textiles at university. she has found it very easy to use and the image quality is very impressive.
very easy to use excellent starting camera
brilliant camera, amazing images from this camera.
a specification good enough to advance to a reasonble level of competence whilst not being over-faced with menus and functions that cannot be understood. the is lens is worth the little bit extra.
nicely put together and very quick shots. image quality very impressive.
easy to change the lens, has brillaint image quality and is a good camera to have for first time dslr users.
fantastic camera outfit for the money!
versatile and with good defaults.

nice dlsr starter camera with clear instructions
this camara is excellent,  the images are great and still lots to learn and explore.
this camera takes fantastic pictures and has a vast range of settings and features which all relatively easy to use, even for a complete amatuer. it also looks good and all the controls are very intuative.
easy to get started. battery life excellent.
very small but with a full range of controls including manual. shoots raw as well as jpeg. the touch screen control is very effective and an excellent build quality. i have owned an s90 for some years and this s110 is a very good upgrade on what was a very good camera anyway that a keen photographer can carry with them anywhere.
very compact and good auto mode.
brilliant photos
pretty easy to use, compact, good image quality.
video is great, easy to use.
point and shoot.    easy zoom.  very clear photographs
fantastic quality, easy to use and a decent price!
fav video camera.. has everything i need and the microphone is still on the front.. not like the s120
its very goooooood
really pleased so far. this is the best camera i'vehad for shooting in low light. indoor shots even have good quality and lighting. fast and easy to find your way around. haven't explored many features yet but very happy with the performance so far. good quality feel and weight to it.
light, video has straight horizons (unlike go pro's that suffer from the barrelling effect)
just a great all round camera.
light and easy to carry
well made, great image quality and lots of manual controls (including fully manual focus).
pocket size. great image quality
brilliant all round.  auto and manual settings, galore!
features can take you from amateur to pro, using point and shoot to manual. wireless facility extremely useful and image quality good.
complete
99%
small,auto bracketing ,very good photo quality,ideal for holidays. excellent price.
easy to use great pictures
great picts easy to use
great camer and with lots of recommendations from pros
great little pocket camera with excellent video capability
photo almost profesional for less money. great value
good camera you can take with you everywhere. easy to use for amateur and good possibilities for experienced photographer.
the multifonction ring around the objective
a great camera in a little package.
video shooting is also very easy, and a very useful feature. if you don't want it, just don't use it, but when you do want it your not loosing time fnding your camcorder.
very good quality of images when using high iso level (to 1200), easy to hold, all fonctionnality as well as a reflex.
the sharp and vibrant quality of the image is outstanding. time frame between pressing the shutter and capturing the shot is almost instantaneous once the lens has focused. diversity of the camera is excellent in relation to capturing  various media subjects utilising the various types of lens available.
this was my first slr, and in all honesty, i expected to have to learn the manual before using. but it is so easy to use, you literally can just turn it on and shoot, as it offers settings that enable you to do that. image quality is sharp and crisp, and it is just an awesome piece of kit. i recommend it to all!
would recommend it to any one thinking of purchasing a dslr for the first time.  there are many accesories which can be purchased for thie camera, and i would recommend a half decent zoom lense if you are interested in wildlife shooting.
the kit lense 18-55mm is is good starting point, you will be looking soon to expand your lense collection (old slr canon ef fit is compatible)
a spare lp-e5 battery.
1080p video is superb providing you're not trying to make a movie but then most people, even with a good camcorder, aren't.
great camera to use a good balance between pro and amateur for settings, you can be creative or let the camera take control.
a dslr with hd video, 15.1 mp enough said
the new larger, more high res screen is great even in bright sun. the 18-55 is kit lens is much better than previous canon kit lenses for basically a cheap lens
image quality, but see below.  image quality in poor light without flash. comfortable to hold.  good quality results with jpeg, no need to use raw.
i have never owned a dslr before but found it easy to pick up the camera and get going without any reading up. learning by fiddling about with settings is fairly easy. more advanced things require reference to the manual, which is small enough to keep handy. the photos look brilliant, and comparisons with other camera-owners seem to suggest that the 500d has more features for the price than anything else. the light weight of the camera is a bonus when carrying it around all day or shooting single-handed.
great images ~ really sharp with excellent colour reproduction . the camera copes extremely well with wierd lighting too ~ like a shot i took of a lit candelabra. took a while to get used to the automatic focus override and am still getting to grips with the manual functions but that could be my problem! the camera is comfortable to hold and light to carry ~ another plus factor for me.
clear display of current settings; very fast in taking exposures after pressing shutter; fast auto-focus
light weight, good big screen and menu's easy to follow.
fast and easy to use in preset modes. once the manual modes are managed very easy to use.
used to work with nikon but wanted to experience canon, good light camera, sensor cleaning and stabilizer are a plus, large lcd screen very handy. a bit confused at the beginning since it is a bit different from nikon but at the end all quite clear and overall a very good camera.
excellent qualit feel to the camera, more than an entry level dslr but less daunting and costly than a pro camera. its perfect for avid photographers who want to have more control over their images. great for creative photographers, image quality is excellent!
image quality
i absolutley love my new camera, it's so easy to use the instruction booklet is easy to read and understand - very unusual for this kind of thing!
overall a very good more than entry level d-slr, and know the price has come down more a very worthwhile purchase.
excellent set features. extremely good build quality for the price. fantastic lcd monitor. ef-s 18-55mm is lens kit is good value. a truly professional camera.
excellent image quality. easy to use functions. lightweight and not too bulky.
a brilliant camera for a complete novis who want to take great photo's and improve their photographic skills
i am new to digital slr photography and i was first scared that the camera might be 'too much' for a beginner, but you can just use the full auto mode until you are comfortable with the other modes. the camera also has a 'creative mode', which is similar to full auto but it gives you some more options and it's really intuitive. i am happy with it!
18- 55mm lens better than expected.
my first slr camera .it was a great choice,highly delighted with it.
changing from photo mode to video is seamingless.
, i am now abe to take advantage of all of the additional features that this type of camer offers. the quality of the pictures taken has now improved dramatically e.g. i can see where the focus point is and so i am not disappointed that the background is in focus but the subjecy isn't on the final image, backgrounds are blurred on portraits when i want them to be.
and i have no issues with holding the camera..
feels well built, pretty small and light for a dslr.  photo quality is outstanding, no complaints about the kit 18-55mm lens which gives sharp detailed snaps.  manual focus ring is fantastic to use.  very happy indeed with the 500d!
just an amazing camera. really intuitive to use. this is the reason canon are so well liked
an excellent first time into serious photography buy. having a great time with my camera learning all my settings on manuel and when i need to opting for the pre set modes. recomended buy.
very light.easy to handle.very,very sleek!
the size look and weight of the 500d is impressive, this shows its good build quality. 15.5/15.1 mega pixels make it perfect for post production and give you good scope to digital zoom and keep the quality. settings display screen is that out of the 50d 920.000 pixels, would put most tvs to shame. lens is great for landscapes and group photos, also portraits, indoors also good with its good f stop. is so worth every penny.
light weight, easy to use
it is a fabulous product which opens up your taste for photography and pushes you to new heights of trying to get that better picture.i am delighted with the results and hope to be able to get a better lens soon to improve my pictures even better.
great picture quality, very sharp - accessible price.
easy to start off using,but have the tools to be creative being fully manual,.my first dslr having used canon eos film up to now,and i'm pleased with it.
easy ty use, good image quality, a good all round camera.
i bought the camera to take on a safari holiday. most of the pictures i took were in auto mode and i must say the quality is fantastic, i am looking forward to using some of the advanced features over the coming months.
lightweight comfortable product, easy functions, excellent results exactly what you would expect from a canon
anyone can use it, just pick it up, turn it on and shoot.  lots of automatic settings which is great for me as a novice. easy to change lenses.
excellent all round camera, great quality pictures and easy to use.
the camera is spot on everything is good
easy to use excellent quality
this is an excellent camera and easy to use, the results are extremely sharp.
features (hd video, shooting modes), build and image quality
an exceptionally easy to use camera.  well worth the money and i would recommend it to anyone looking to step up from a standard digitial camera.
not too heavy and good to handle. excellent picture quality. proper macro feature as opposed to some cameras where it means you can focus only slightly nearer than normal.
advanced camera with all slr features. well built
light to carry, easy to use slr camera. iq excellent.
seems very straightforward to use with excellent picture quality
easy to use and has enough functions to span from using the camera as a complete novice to using the camera as an experienced photographer.

price :)
-- in fact have just ordered the telephoto lens even tho' i already have 2  other t/p lenses which i'm going to get rid of.   overall i'm very happy with my purchase and can't wait for next month when i'm off to brazil to try it out!!!!!

5+
n/a
relatively compact and not too heavy to carry around. a very good entry-level slr.
this is a fantastic camera suitable for any conditions. great in low light or overbright conditions.takes super sharp pictures and is compatible with any lens and extender.good colours easy to use.well recommended
high resolution, 9 point focus, face recognition, large viewing screen and all the functions i expect from canon.  what more could i ask for?  this is just the camera i have been waiting for!
awesome shutter speed and image burst and excellent screen. battery life very good. still learning all the features but it has surpased my expectations.
excellent rear screen definition and more rapid/accurate focusing than earlier model (i previously had canon 20d dslr). pictures quality higher (15 megapixel) and hdmi output provides excellent viewing on lcd tv. shutter quieter than 20d and more rapid multiple shot sequences. works well with a range of lenses.
great leap from my 400d. loads of added and useful features, great build quality. new screen is fantastic.
live view, which i'll admit i initially though was a gimic has already saved me crawling around on the floor to get a low vantage point... i'll happily stand corrected on that point.
greatly improved rear screen.
picture quality is brilliant.
first class camera would highly recommend.
fantastic pictures straight out of the box.  i have never had a camera which takes better pictures.  i use it for wildlife shots on my farm and am very happy - even when enlarging pictures many times.
plenty of pixels, excellent build quality, faster and better processor, large screen with easy to navigate menus, sensor cleaning system.
excellent camera - handles well and does everything you need.
easy to use as a back up for my eos 1d. excellent image quality and plenty of professional features. the magnesium body makes it ideal for heavy use.
larger lcd display,easier menu layout,quick focusing ,increased pixel count, build quality.
image quality
feels very comfortabel to hold ,easy to use,very sturdy build, images better now that i have altered the settngs to personal preferences would recomend it to anyone
an excellent camera, very good features and very good quality of the images. becide the fact that it is a profetional slr it has some fanction that make it as easy as a point and shoot.
solid build, great image quality and more functionality than i know what to do with (yet). i'd been using a 350d for a number of years and wondered for a long time whether upgrading would be worth it. the answer is a definite yes.
very easy to use straight for the box. superb upgrade option and signifgicant improvement from a 300d/350d/20d or 30d.
its not the first expensive camera that ive had but it is the best
i upgraded from a canon eos 400d (which i loved) as i have become a lot more proficient with my photography skills. i got to the stage where there were limitations with what my 400d could do for me. i was torn between going for the 500d or this 50d. i wasn't bothered about the videoing capabilities of the 500d so opted for the 50d. i like the sturdy feel and can look forward to getting to grips with the many different features available.
very well balanced camera, feels good to handle.  the speed of the camera is breathtaking, everything about the camera screams quality.
ease of use,ability to shoot in very low light,with excelent results,
very good all around
its a good few steps up from my 450d and i am still experimenting with it
excellent value for money camera
live view
it`s just a very good camera
very impressed with this camera over all pic quality and shutter speed
solid, quality feel as with all canon top of range products, familiar to use as this range has not changed much from the 10d up
live view,good build quality,good range of acessories.
its a canon dslr they are the best
i have just upgraded from a 450d and i can say this 50d is real quality at a bargin price. it just feels right, for shooting horses showjumping it is great with just over 6 fps i never miss a good picture, the 450d just couldn't quite keep up. battery life is great, just shot about 900-1000 frames on first charge (admittedly no flash used). i shot some photos at a wedding yesterday and they've come out great, even with low light in the church, images have come out sharp and clear. all in all its a great camera and i would even recommend it over a 7d if all you need is a still camera, i still don't understand why people want to use a dslr to shoot video, but then again i'm probably short sighted. i recommend getting some quality glass to go with this beauty, i bought a canon 24-105 l and its ace. by far the best two purchases i have made towards better photography.
its a canon
made in the cannon mould
capacity seems to be higher than original, which is 1390mah. this has 1800mah.
navigation,easy to use,very handy body
informative preview screens with focus points showing
excellent piece of kit.
all of the above
an excellent camera giving good sharp pictures
this is my first digital camera and i,am very pleased with it,cannot find any faults with it so far.
large screen, large image size, good colour sensitivy
excellent build quality and 21 mp can't be bad either!!!!!!!!!!!
+ high iso results much better than the 450d
great product, great price, you can use the canon charger to charge and i think it lasts longer than the canon battery
same as canon one.
great feel to the camera
really good for image quality and pretty easy to use! and the value is really good i think
three raw sizes
light, great picture quality, fun to use!
as good as the original canon battery. can't tell the difference except of course the price.
build quality is excellent  with a metal body. image quality is very good with the right lens and is still pretty good at high iso. large high resolution screen for image review. liveview feature. around 6 fps for sports/wildlife is very useful.  2 programmable modes is very nice.
upgraded fro a 350d - it is solid and stable and has excellent quality  - the 15+megapixels make a difference. lot sof fetauers which serve me well and more!!
excellent product ,  great pictures,
haven't had it for too long, but i'm able to take great pics fairly early on with the kowledge that there is still huge amounts of untapped potential once i get the many features sussed. a well built body that,for me, feels comfortable when i handle it.
great features and build quality. 15mp!! super clear display screen and fast focusing.
excellent features, super picture quality, very nice robust feel to this camera with a magnesium body, the creative settings and high iso settings make this a very versatile piece of kit.
great follow on camera from the basic eos 400d
excellent images, ease of use and and the ergonomics.
great feature set but does require user input to get the best out of camera. if you only intend to use it on auto save yourself some money and just buy a good compact.
70-200mm canon l usm lens,brilliant quality images.would highly recommend.
from the 400d to this the 600d, it has been improved no end. live view is a very usefull feature for taking pictures over the heads ofd people in a crowd and down to earth level for macro. sd card is also good, over all a great little camera. a very happy customer, so far.
great upgrade from the1000d , excellent value for \xa3\xa3\xa3 .
responsive
a good bit of kit
this camera is so easy to use in conjunction with the manual. takes fantastic pictures.
if familiar with earlier models such as 350 / 400d you will find the 600d very easy to use.  the display screen is very clear for reviewing images.
solid build quality and good results
much smaller and lighter than the more pro models and the lcd being able to swivel not only protects the screen from zips when carrying it around the neck but also saves getting into too many different positions to see your shot
overall a great camera, this is the third upgrade i have made and the best so far. very easy to use and produces first class pictures.the video option is also very good and again very simple to use.
pictures are super amazing, of course depends on lens, but i am very happy with what i have done so far.
easy to get fantastic quality images.  i've just upgraded from a eos350d and the new larger lcd is a great improvement for reviewing photos (also see bad points..).  the 600d seems to have much better control of focus points.  all in all, well worth the upgrade.
overall, very good value for money
this camera is a pleasure to use....the q menu system makes adjusting parameters a doddle
the live view mode, fold out screen, quick controls, professional features
i had the 400d and up grade to the 600d which is a great camera all round.
very happy
ease of use.fantastic image quality.adjustable lcd screen.buy a 50mm lens with this camera,its much better than the standard.
image quality. buy body only and put a decent lens on, 50mm f/1.8.
10
good camera
good all rounder....ive only used tamron lens with this camra sofar, as i dont have any canon lens, never the less i cant falt the camra
everything is easy to use and the pictures are great
good all round photoes look great excellant
great entry level camera. would recommend for somebody just starting. takes a decent picture too.
great quality pictures, hd video, easy to sue, great auto settings.
canon take note: nikon cameras are better made, better spec'd and cheaper - you're playing a dangerous game, and a diminshing market share will be your future!
great value, high spec camera body. the moving live view screen is very helpful and very clear images on it
screen very clear. information automatically loaded on screen when moving from one setting to another. light weight.
fairly compact for an slr with all the features you could reasonably want.
all
a truly superb camera and with a vast array of lens and accesories freely available a brilliant base to build from.  well made, well positioned controls and easy to use.  this camera is suitable for beginners to pro's and if you are just starting out in photography this camera has all the features you need as your knowledge grows.
every thing about this camera body is just a wonderful piece of kit
top class camera.
easy to use straight out of box, but with lots of advanced features available as you progress.
price
cheaper than a canon 60d, lighter, has hd video
when you buy a 50mm with this body its amazing, don't get the standard lens its rubbish
value for money when comparing features with more expensive cameras
quick set allows easy and intuitive setting of iso, shutter, aperture, mode and various other paremeters depending on the shooting option selected.
live view
another very good update from canon.  i appreciate the various oicture formats and the arty modes add a bit of fun to a serious piece of kit.
superb camera for someone looking to improve the picture quality from entry level slr or bridge/superzoom cameras and wishing to learn along the way. do not however expect point'n'shoot straight from card picture quality. experience in working with photoshop as well as further investment in better lenses is required to appreciate full capability of this small miracle.
tamron takes nice closeups, especially if used with a tripod.
it's a fantastic camera and lens deal - great images and very intuitive features/controls
fantastic quality pix and fast enough to keep up with a horse.  easy to hold and use but then i like canon products.  took advice initially from a pro in the states.
the eos 550d is everything your looking form a slr camera. it sit's really well in the hand and the picture quality is nothing short of the very top quality. with hd video as well as photo's you have everything you need in one place. this is the camera to have and hold....it will also last the test of time.
everything an excellent product which gives fantastic image quality.  perfect for amateur motorsport photography which is what it will be mainly used for.
excellent system  easy to use with well positioned controls. great variety of systems from simple point and shoot to close control through programs, great camera for a serious amateur as well a budding phorographer.
the lenses matched to the chassis are more than adequate  for everyday use.
excellent piece of kit especially from a new users point of view.  lots of play factor.
the movie mode is awesome.
menu is clear and, once you have the hang of it, very easy to use.  i have taken some very good (for me!) action photographs and landscapes.  the feel and balance seem just right.
never go item
excelent picture quality even from far away
simplicity of menus . quality of images, flexibility , feels great in your hand
lenses great quality photos
i just love it
the camera is easy to use with a good understandable and readable manual provided.  as a novice, this helped me get started.  have taken hundreds of pictures in the month i have had the camera and already found my way round the various programs and improved my photographs!  the software provided is adequate but i wouldn't rave about it.
simple functions, quality camera...!
only had the camera a few weeks but reults are very good and it is easy to use.   haven't tried everything yet but looks like it has all the features an enthusiast will need, menus are easy to understand and access.
brilliant camera for someone wanting to progress in digital photography. the camera itself gives you so much help and assistance, it makes it nearly impossible to take a bad picture.
well suited to keen amateur willing to take the time to learn how to get the best results.
this is my first canon camera i have purchased last one i had was a sony dsc-s600 which serverd its purpose, needed to upgrade to a better quality camera as i have young kids and wanted to capture there younger years, my reason of choice for the canon powershot sx220 hs, was the good reviews i read of the canon sx210, the sx220 was a newer model to be relesed so i went for this. have to say so far very impressed with the quality of pictures it takes, and the 14x optical zoom is amazing, the genral feel of this camera is nice, it has a good build quality for a point and shoot camera its really amazing, as you can take very good pictures in low light condtions without the flash. im no expert on features and settings but have found it very easy to use, really suprised at how userfreindly i have found switching to different modes and how easy it is to use the menu. the hd video is so easy to use and you can easliy use the zoom function while recording with out affecting the quality of the video still learning to use the different setting so can not really say to much on the different setting modes, but so far very impressed.
great focussing and produces great, crisp images when shooting potraits.
i have owned several earlier models and this corrects the problem of it being very easy to inadvertently move the camera off the auto setting. great screen, and excellent picture quality. on highest zoom setting a tripod is advisable.
quality product
as for value for money, it certainly was in my case, as it was on a special offer, being end of range, but if purchased elsewhere, at full rrp it is really more expensive than it should be compared to others with same specifications.
terrific zoom, robust build quality, ability to manually adjust settings and good in low light
i bought this as a replacement for my much loved canon ixus, basing my choice entirely on recommendations from the net. i have not had time to get to grips with half the features but what i'm particuarly impressed with so far is the incredible zoom range and quality. i also love the continuous shot mode that has allowed me to get some great candid shots of the kids when they refuse to sit still and pose. movie quality is superb. battery life seems pretty good too.
the price was good for the features advertised.
excellent zoom capabiliity for such a small camera
easy to use and great results. i'm very impressed with the video quality - even when taken indoors. photos taken indoors are excellent and i often don't even need to use the flash. i'm very pleased with the camera. i used it on a 5 day trip away and haven't needed to recharge it yet :d
very versatile camera, automatic and manual modes, excellent optical zoom range to capture most scenes from wide angle to distant
zoom lens, features, picture quality and ability to use full manual control in a compact design that it is easy to carry it everywhere
great camera for the money
just another excellent canon camera. images are very good. the only slight issue is trying to keep the camera still when using the zoom in video mode.
excellent range of features and quality within a very compact pocket-sized camera.
great image quality, outstanding display..very clear view, loads of new features, amazing zoom -total of 56x including the digital.very good video quality!
zoom lens is excellent!
all good so far. compact, weighty enough for stabilising shot and doesn't feel like a toy. great zoom. great selection of settings, auto smile is fun, when the subject smiles the camera takes the photo! but plenty for the seriously keen photographer. been looking to replace my old canon for years but the picture quality was still so good that it was difficult to beat. i am very happy with this as a replacement.
picture quality is very good in low light. very compact and has most of the functions you would find on slr cameras. the screen is sharp and clear.
zoom, ease of use, picture/video quality
excellent, simple to use camera.  brilliant zoom for nature and sport photography.
convenience of a compact camera. fantastic zoom. always been a fan of canon ixus compacts but this is much better!
excellent indoor photos without flash which was main reason to buy this camera after lots of wasted photos before with another well known brand.also 14 x zoom very good.very easy to follow guide on screen which helps a lot when camera is new.feels a solid camera.
good battery life.
great picture quality - even when on full zoom.  build quality excellent.  interface intuitive and far more capability than i'll even need.  small and compact.
big amount of possible effects (fish eye included) and a great little camera with capability of satisfying an experienced photographer
very nice, feels like a quality product. even the battery life is good, we're getting between 350-500 pics on a full charge and recharging doesn't take that long.
easy to use
good optical zoom, easy to use, good pics and hd video
i bought the camera for its long zoom and low light capabilities. i am not disappointed. as a leisure user, i don't find the popup flash or the battery life a problem.
good screen and correct colour reproduction
good quality pictures, compact, easy to pick up and use.
great video
the camera really takes good images
great little camera to easily carry with you when the slr would be a little too bulky.

brilliant entry camera, i have never used one before or owned one only ever had compact cameras. this camera gives you intstructions on screen of what each feature means and does, and makes it extremely easy to use and create great creative pictures. the bundle is very much worth the money as it includes all extras that the normal camera does not, and all for a fantastic price! couldn't say anything more about this product, its brilliant!!
very good value with many
very light and easy to use for a beginner to digital photography
fantastic i love it.
for the price its a brilliant package. all i read from other people is them moaning about the build quality and the plastic look of it, for the price the camera is very good and easy to use. yes it looks a bit cheap but to be honest i dont look for that in a camera i take pictures with a camera not sit it on a shelf and look at it!

build quality and gives me options more often found on a slr but without the bulk.
macro, and multy position veiw finder

when you press the shutter it takes the picture, there is no delay like so many digital cameras.
menu system makes it easy to use even for those with no previous experience of digital slrs
excellent straight out of the box. better than my 20d except for continous shooting.
very easy to use, on automatic setting it takes a lovely photo even with an amatuer at the controls! on manual you get some great photographic results.
it is so easy to use and i could use the lenses from my old 35mm eos on this. the pictures are great and you can zoon in on something in the distance crop it and it looks just as good as the original, this is from a techno phobe
excellent image quality. small size. anti dust system. feels more solid than 350d.
what more could you ask for in a camera other than camera shake demobilizer
a great buy for the money
excellent camera with user friendly features.
great size for holding.  superb image quality and size.  very fast start up time.  i'm new to raw files, it's fantastic for changing the white blance after taking the photo eg - you can change a yellow tinged photo taken indoors to neutral by changing the wb to tungston.
easy to handle and light weight for an slr ,very good picture quality .
excellent image quality when used correctly, good frame capture rate, very easy to use.
in-built flash is very good.
battery pack and its re-charging
battery life is excellent.
quality of image and ease of use
it's an excellent camera to handle, which is expected from canon. the image quality is mind blowing! the anti-dust mechanism is an added bonus!
so easy to use and great that it has similarities to my other canons, therefore quite easy to pick up and use first time. quality and affordability is brilliant. it's a pleasure to play with.
was my 35mm pentax spf.
if your thinking of entering into the world of digital photography, i would recommend the canon, the features available on this model, and the image quality are exceptional. the interchangeable lenses are a big advantage, enabling the user to have a basic point and shoot camera, and as confidence grows, experimenting with additional lenses and using various features. as with all canon products you get what you pay for, and accessories can be costly. in my opinion the quality far outweighs the price.
the camera is well balanced and has very good feel.  it is svery straight forward to use from the outset.  menus are simple to use and the auto focus is rapid.  battery life is long, though at this price a spare battery ought to be supplied.
nice to handle easy to use, excellent results
quality of photos. speed of operating picture after picture, price
had to buy this only a couple of days before a trip to see polar bears in canada (my old camera fell apart). managed to use it with ease, in spite of not being familiar with digital cameras. good size screen on back - can see what you've taken clearly.
the camera is of excellent quality, with many features and makes a beginner photographer take pictures which are like a pro.
i have found that as with most canon products it is quite easy to use, but still learning all the features. one wery useful feature is the optical adjustment on the eyepiece resolving the problem of reading specs.
the camera is light, comfortable to hold and use, the 10 megapixels gives fantastic quality, and the feature are easy to use and understandable.  excellent camera!
the best and easiest to use digital slr that i havwe ever owned.
low noise at high sensitivity. light weight. compatible with earlier eos lenses available secondhand. self-cleaning sensor.  the best camera i have bought since my k1000 in 1980.
easy to use, a good first digital slr
focusing features (selection of focusing points). overall ease of use. number of changeable programme features. excellent value for money.
lightweight and compact. will take lots of shots in one burst. image quality very good. east to use menu - better than the 300d it has replaced.
picture quality and simplicity of use is superb
for a first time user of a digital slr it handles superbly - having only used it on a point and shoot basis so far the results have been excellent
gives a great picture and can be used by someone both new to photography but also experienced
superb beginner's camera that with the right lenses can take you to intermediate level and beyond

extremely easy to use

i'm a beginner with regards to slrs and not terribly experienced with photography yet, but i am getting there. the 400d is so easy to navigate and using the presets makes it a breeze to use. i also find the manual settings and priorities pretty easy to use. this will allow me to progress with my hobby and my enjoyment of it witout making life hard.
light to carry; reasonable viewfinder; eyecup provided; good grip
i'm a real novice with an slr but have been really impressed with what i've seen so far. i do know a couple of professional photographers who reccommended this to me as the perfect introduction to slr so must be good!

great camera; light, intuitive, a great introduction to dslrs.
an excellent slr with great features and image quality.  if you are reading this to decide which slr to buy then this  is the one.  you'll be an accomplished photographer before you need anything better.

great all round camera just select auto, point and shoot

so simple to use. battery lasts forever. good value for money
good quality with a wide range of functions but which the option of full manual control for more advanced users.
very straightforward automatic modes, plus plenty of other options to explore.  decent built in flash - takes better pictures indoors than many.
when everything goes right, it takes phenonominal photos and the flexibility of dslrs, particularly when using the raw file format is excellent.
ease of use and good quality pictures.
will give excellent results when matched with a good quality lens
only had it a month but it works great and the supplied editing software does the job
very easy to use. you can take many shots in quick succession.
i loved the package deal for this product i wanted to upgrade my camera (small digital) to a decent camera that i could take good sports shots with so having a deal with both a small and a bigger lens was perfect.

features, size, quality

great camera - very easy to use and has a great functionality.
for the price and features of the model, this is an excellent value for money point and shoot camera that delivers surprisingly professional results. there is a degree of adjustability allowing the user a degree of control over the results.

excellent picture quality. good battery life.
good value
optical viewfinder
lens is brilliant - certainly worth the extra over the standard lens.
ease of use, controls are generally of a good size and have a positive feel.  the grip feels secure in the hand because of the texture of the finish, which makes you confident you aren't going to drop it.   balance and feel are better than my old t-90.  the displays both outside and through the viewfinder are informative and clear.   auto-focus is fast and reliable - manual focussing is easy with the supplied screen.  metering is spot-on.  colours are well presented, if slightly warm under certain lighting conditions.  the kit lens has a real quality feel to it.  the zoom is silky-smooth and the image-stabilising works very well.
i bought the camera with the 17-85mm ef-s lens - it is quiet and quick to focus
(point and shoot) mode to produce good results. weighty, but ergonomic. i would highly recommend it.
the camera work as it should and is as fast which when photographing my grandaughter horse riding the images were very very good.   the camera is easy to use if you are a canon person and the lens lived up to its expectations.    all in all the camera is doing the job i purchased it for.
easy to use, even for a relative novice. nice weight, feels as if you have a professional camera in your hand without being too heavy. produces excellent images nearly every time. highly recommended.
really proud to own one (for a slightly heavier price compared to consumer models, you get much more in this prosumer).
larger easier to read screen in sunny conditions.good build quality with improved water resistance. fast start up time. easier to download onto computer.17-85 lens with stabilisation good. camera feels right.
this camera is large and robust and does not feel heavy over long periods, image quality is excellent and the features is has is also excellent
bright large lcd screen, great shots at slow shutter speeds with the is lens, i found dials and buttons easy to use. battery life exceptionally good.
great semi-pro type of camera, well build with easy access to functions. good software.
its just another great canon dslr. a big step up from my eos d30 bought new in 2000. great image quality and low noise performance. excellent colour balance and dynamic is very good too.
overall, this kit is superb. picture quality is faultless at 200 iso and below. 10 megapixels is plenty!    if you can, buy an l series lens.
easy to use and takes fab. pictures
brilliant screen. much better menus than the 20d and 350d. live view is a bonus when using on a tripod. nice weight and balanced when using 17-85is. not too heavy with canon 100-400is lens. will be my primary camera from now on.
grip and balance. speed of focus.
image quality excellent
the eos 40 was replacing my eos 350d. the camera is very nicely balanced with a much better display screen than that on the 350. the controls are well laid out but with so many setting options the manual needs to be at hand to make changes. the review screen is much bigger and clearer than the 350 but is still  difficult to clearly review in bright sunlight. so far picturers taken with the 17 - 85 have been very good and the image stablising feature has noticeably reduced blured shots. the battery appears to hold its charge much longer, which is good as i haven't yet bought a second battery. i have since purchased a 75 - 300 is lens and am very pleased with action shots taken with this lens. overall i am well pleased with the camera and would definately recommend it to others.
the 40d is very easy to use. i upgraded from a 300d and the controls were similar enough that the transfer was painless. the additional functions, such as live view (especially through the lap top!) are fantastic.  the camera feels well built and is extremely comfortable to use. the shutter is quiet, and the rapid shot superb.  being able to take raw and jpg together is a useful (if data-hungry) function.
very happy with the 40d my first dslr, great fun learning to use, surprisingly easy to get to grips with the main functions, great quality results and good build, really appreciate the display on the top, lens is excellent, not at all cheap. battery lasts for ages and charges quickly, pc remote control software is fun, editing software is ok. feel like the paperazzi with the 6 shots/second, girls love it. for results i'd say the 40d with17-85is lens is three times as good as the best compact and 50% better than the 400d.
wide range of lenses and accesories
good in low light
functions, speed - great range of products
well made and easy to handle
its agood camera  l cannot fault it
very good build and image quality, and its easy for complete beginners to pick up the camera and start shooting great photos.
monitor is well lit.
a stunning camera--lots more to explore
well built, solid camera and lens, feels good to hold - especially with big hands. brilliantly clear viewfinder. pc socket for non-canon studio/hammerhead flash units. i''m really pleased with it.
stunning images
excellent build quality, fine lens and whole range of features that you would expect from a camera of this price range
plenty of features - though lots to learn!
pictures are much more superior
6 fps shooting is a world away from 3 when selecting moving objects - my kids on swings, trampoline etc.
build quality
i have a lot of learning to do, but this camera should be good for many years to come and has the scope to grow with me...
handling is good. it is quick in focusing and is quiet.
speed and multiple shot capacity for raw images
great picture quality
amazing quality for a pro-sumer dslr the lense is superb quality and something i was going to buy for my 350d but given the price of this kit i had to buy both! a huge improvement over the 20/30d which were in my sights over the last 2 years.
great to use. feels good to handle. good pictures. very fast re-cycle time. fast focussing lens (17-85 kit lens). accurate focussing even in low light. good battery life. lots of features. good software. love it.
build quality and overall feel. ease of use. features, particularly image stabilisation, sensor cleaning and live view.
the menu is uncomplicated and easy to follow . the controls are very well positionedand in easy reach allowing the camera to be operated with ease . the view finder is large and bright with good information displayed and i found the focus points very useful. i found the sports mode at six frames a second was excellent for taking photographs of moving subjects and with its continuous auto focus allowed me to capture garden birds on the feeder and select the best picture. the camera is well balanced making it easy to hold steady and when coupled with the image stabilizer lens almost eliminates all camera shake which can be seen through the view finder when holding the shutter release half way down.
fantastic features, excellent build quality, great contrast. included software is very good too.
if your considering buying a xxxd and are tempted by the xxd range then spend the extra and be secure in the knowledge that the xxd will last longer, give better results and make you feel a whole let better than have having in comparison some tonker toy in your hand which is what the xxxd feels like.
10 out of 10 what else can be said!
fast shooting for action shots
excellent build quality, overall sturdy feel, great lens with image stabilisation, large lcd screen, selectable iso button, sensor cleaning
excellent results from a camera that i keep finding more clever and versatile things about.
usm fast focusing lens
as the first dslr i have owned it is complex but flexible and i am confident i will enjoy using it. i could happily score it 10 for all features but have varied it to give the impression that i have some critical knowldge.
i had a canon 20d before this which was good, for this camera they have improved the menu layout and options and made some of the user settings available from the dial setting. the sensor cleaners is also  a very godd option
simple intuitive camera to use.
very high specification + reasonable price = happy snapper.
good image quality, fast start up, large buffer, good focusing, many features, flexibilty, build quality.
good features.accurate focussing.smooth motordrive.
pretty much everything. this is the first time i have had an is lens too and it's awesome
generally better all round than my previous eos300d (which i rate quite highly).
usual canon quality, ideal for experienced photographers and amatuers.
intuitve controls with a good sized screen.
sturdy well built camera-excellent live view screen-well featured if you want to strive to be more than an amateur
the zoom is fantastic as is the quality and like all the canon power shots, the sx100 is really easy to use. also i love the fact that it takes aa bateries (some might not like this) as i travel frequently and can't rely on chargers.
excellent feel to the camera ie build quality, 10 x optical zoom in a compact is amazing.  image stabilzation make the camera very easy to use and the results are excellent.  as usual excellent canon quality lens, still one of the most important things to me.
good zoom and optical image stabilzaton and face detection ,very good photos ,easy to use and very good video mode.nice to hold,some good design and interface and like the jog wheel for viewing pictures.
matches with window xp easily:- overall excellent value for money
very good image quality, good flash, very cheap for what you get out of it
it is easy to use and is a good little camera
ease of taking pictures in auto mde and quality of pictures

excellent camera, it was purchased for my mum and she wanted one that had a screen and a view finder.
it is an easy camera to carry around in your pocket.   i like the fact that the separate viewfinder means that you don't suffer if the light is too bright to see the screen.
easy to use
i really like this camera, for many and some obvious reasons: amazing power in a very handy little box that fits in any pocket. good still picture zoom facitlity, and easiliy accessible modes. in short, a gem!
i was told to choose quality of lens over quantity of mega-pixels but the canon ixus has both!  its superb lens gives stunning picture quality and the zoom takes crystal clear shots even at 12x zoom.  the camera has good design, sturdy casing and is easy to use.  it also has a viewfinder but i have never had to use it as the lcd screen is excellent.  i can't actually fault this camera as it has exceeded all my expectations.
compact size. elegant design. superb functionality
v good images, easy to use
i found all features of the camera easy to use once you've explored the menu a few times. very impressed with the quality off the different shooting modes, came in very handy when out in the snow and lots of indoor photos in different environments.

bombproof quality, wonderful feel, easy to use canon 2-dial system, loads of lens choice
was the best in its class for a brief  few months - eclipsed by canon 20 d about 2 months after i bought it!
does everything brilliantly. does more than you will ever need. it's limit is the person using it.

excellent small camera with lots of features - image stabilization makes a big difference.
good value!
display, shooting modes, image stabiliser.
good range of shooting modes with ablility to switch to manual for creative shots
excellent pictures, image stabilisation, 6x zoom, aa batteries, sd card - appears the only one in it's class at this price
similar to my canon slr but with all the features of digital
image stabiliser, general features, screen, viewfinder, able to use aa batteries, generally easily to operate
is feature
very comprehensive range of features.
easy initial use, can get going straightaway and the picture quality is great
versatile all rounder
6 x zoom, easy to use
ordinary batteries. optical eye viewer.
image stabiliser (the too-old to text generation want digital cameras too!) - viewfinder (i did not even consider a camera without one) - well designed menus system - large screen- can use as point/shoot or with features familiar to a former slr user - light weight - large enough to hold comfortably - good grip design
easy to use and understand.  good quality photos but batteries,
being a senior citizen with not the best eyesight i use the camera on auto and find it very simple to use and the results are very good zooming in and out is also simple, i am pleased with the camera
very compact and easy to use
great close-up macro capability
great quality pictures and video. fantastic value for money. packed full of features.
is a great camera for the absolute beginner with its auto modes but also great for the more advanced (like me!) who also want to be able to make their own exposure decisions, whilst only having to carry around a small lightweight camera.
quality of zoom and macro images; the image stabilisation feature; the range of special settings and the facility to customise settings. good software, too.
good zoom facility and picture composition compared to the earlier models. excellent range of features which i still need to explore. smaller and lighter than previous models.
full manual controls giving the flexibility and control of an dslr in the form of a compact. viewfinder is a nice touch.
compact, ergonomic design. excellent video footage and picture quality. great effects. additional lenses. big camera style in a compact.
easy to use menu
large screen, 6x optical zoom, compact size
excellent image quality and very rapid response - fast focus and very small shutter lag. optical viewfinder is a definite plus point which many other manufacturers have abondoned. very good macro at the wide angle settings. unusually long zoom at the tele end, for a compact.
easy to use
great little camera turns on withni a second. some good features and some that are far above what i'll ever use, but nice that they're there anyway.
idiot proof and excellent build quality.
generally an excellent camera in terms of features, quality and ease of use
has just about everything you need from a 'smaller' camera before getting a lot bigger and a lot more expensive. excellent picture quality. a lot of great features but if i'm honest 98% of the pictures i've taken have had the camera set to auto! has just about the best video i've seen on a camera. i've surprised myself with how many times i've used it.
optical viewfinder, image stabilisation, 6x zoom, aa batteries, large lcd, range of features.
low light performance.
compact design, ease of use, easy to understand controls
i'm still experimenting with the pre-set features. i have not mastered the advance features yet.
zoom, resolution
easy to use, not reliant on the screen, i still like  to use the view finder.  feels good in your hands, nice grip and solid feel. great zoom
easy to use as a basic camera with plenty of extras for when i get bored with it! the quality is excellent.
excellent picture quality
light weight, able to put in pocket, good results so far with use and ease of use able to ajust to suit one's photography
great, easy to use
size.  is.  reasonable zoom range.
solid feel. excellent results when used in auto  mode for quick shots. i like the 'chunky' feel of it and its weight which adds to the image stability feature when shooting.
i bought this camera for scj=hool use and so value its sturdy construction and ease of use.  it takes fantastic pictures and is simple enoug for any teacher to use!
all good!
image quality is very good and image stabilisation works extremely well.
speed
good grip and weight, feels solid but not too heavy. gives a feeling that you will not shake camera easily.
excellent resolution and easy to use functionality.
so easy to use and great qualty photos and movie footage, love the fact that it has a built in feature where you n film as well as take pictures!
it is simple to use especialy for someone like myself with little experience in photography.
good picture quality
excellent on-line price, almost double the cost at other retailers
was disappointed with an earlier similar canon model because of lack of image stabilization and a couple of other things, but this seems to have it all.  flip screen is ideal for what i use it for.
versatility
good size display screen.  controls very easy to use.  reasonably compact.
love the variable angle lcd screen, the main reason why i bought the camera. i use it a lot in between changing batteries, so it seems to be energy efficient too.
ergonomic design with fexi screen means it is easy to hold and can produce images from unusual angles
so versitile the ajustable screen being a big help in geting the shot i want as i can get worms or birds eye view.
all the above
variable position lcd screen
i am a serious snapper. sometimes i want fill in flash, sometimes i want to use an aperture priority setting but mostly i want a camera that does everything by itself. this camera suits me perfectly. it uses standard aa batteries which is brilliant as you can pick up rechargables very reasonably. the start up time is very good.
comfortable to hold; clear screen and viewfinder; obvious shutter sound so that you 'know' you've taken a picture; easy to use for basic photography with added functions for the more serious photographer.
large lcd screen.  auto setting produces good results if you are too lazy to use other settings.  starter memory card is with practising with a few times before putting a larger card in - a good way to learn.  image stabilization is very effective.
i haven't got to grips with all the features, but this takes good clear images.  macro is very pleasing.  i couldn't do good close ups on my previous camera.  i also like the image stabilzer.  the canon software which loads the pictures on to the computer etc is easy to use.
initial impressions are really encouraging. the larger lcd screen is obviously better but still is difficult to view on bright days
good picture quality, and brilliant zoom, easy to use.
easy to use, great pics, price on digital cameras still quite high for most people.
great camera, most features are instictive if you have used a digital camera before.  i only needed to use the manual when it came to the features i didn't have on my old fuji.  image quality is great i did an a4 picture of my friends cat and each hair stood out in fine detail.  this is a good progression for a second camera which has enough automatic settings to get you started but leaves you wanting to have a fiddle with the more advanced things you can do with it.  i also think you can't beat the fact this camera has an optical viewfinder not just the screen, all digital camera makers should take note this is what tipped me against other similar spec cameras in this price bracket.
gives very good results on auto setting. the menu and dial are very intuitive; i got used to it very quickly. the image stabilisation is excellent. i have very shaky hands but still get good results even at full zoom. the software is also very easy to set up and use, and makes it very easy to find and edit photo's.
picture quality. images from this camera are often mistaken for those taken with an eos
sd card, aa batteries, optical viewfinder, high quality movies with sound to limit of memory card, 2.5 inch lcd screen.
compact design.
x6 zoom is what i was wanting, and it is great.  aa size batteries means you can always buy fresh ones if the rechargeable ones run out of charge.  having the viewfinder is useful in sunny conditions.  the high speed 2 gb chip in the package works brilliantly.  power-up and power-down work quickly.
excellent camera - good pictures, easy to use - and survived being dropped on a mountaintop!
you can just point and click or fiddle to your heart's content. i must say i was impressed by the quality of the photos when one zooms in.
its nice and easy to use and is friendly for those who are not good with cameras
qulaity of photos
good quality product for price- very good reliable camera in every way.
great camera, auto function excellent. time between each pictures is very short, camera is always ready.face detection very very good. quality of pictures  very near to that of slr cameras..physical build of camera is good quite robust
i had the powershot 700 before and have upgraded to the 720 with image stabelizer and more pixels.
easy to use. if you are not fully into photography, you can easily understand this camera. you can either use all facilities or like myself, leave on auto and it does the job brilliantly. also includes a viewfinder, which most cameras lack nowadays, useful in sunny weather.
great screen
the camera is a little larger than some, but i find this helps with the handling of the camera
i have owned this excellent camera for a month. image quality is great.  a wide range of preset shooting modes (portrait, landscape, night shots, etc) and there is also full manual control for those who want to advance their photography skills. the macro setting in particular has given me some fabulous pictures. the video mode is also useful. good value for money.
image stabilisation is great. picture quality is very good.
very good image quality straight out of the camera. very useful zoom range. a lot of manual controls should you wish to use them. very smooth movie mode. uses aa batteries. is a canon.
the powershot a720is can be relied upon to take good photos in most situations and is dead easy to use.
it is very compact yet sturdy.  the menus are easy to operate and the picture quality is very good.  an all round camera for novice photographers and experienced amateurs alike. extensive range of options for shooting in different conditions and even movie playback option.
the camera is easy to use and the controls are well thought through facilitating picture composition.  it was bought primarily because it had a viewfinder (avoiding sunlight reflecting from the screen) and it was a pleasant surprise to find that it appears to work through the lense like an slr .  power usage is low and i am still using the original batteries.  build quality is good. real value for money.
good quality results. adequate zoom range
optimum size - not too small. easy to handle. plenty of features - probably too many, as i am not very experienced. found it very easy to use the basics. very easy to focus and the image stabilisation is brilliant. a great camera - very good value.
the camera is also nice and light and compact.
a brilliant small camera with a good memory with a viewfinder, and an excellent optical zoom.
size (goes in shirt-pocket, just), 6x zoom, fabulous picture quality, fast shutter response, excellent macro goes incredibly close (but see bad points), effective flash, big screen (but see bad points), optical viewfinder, sensible layout of controls.  haven't got to more complex use yet, but seems like plenty of possibilities.  i always have loads of aa rechargeables with me for gps, torch etc, so for me the fact that it uses aa is a plus point.
briliant pictures
compact size.
small and compact fits easily in pocket.  good zoom and easy to use menus .
very sharp image,good colours,good zoom range
this little camera takes excellent pictures, is economical and has enough manual settings to make a perfect second camera for anyone with an slr. for less experienced photographers wanting to learn more about photography, the a720is is an excellent place to start.
quality - manual options - easy point and shoot!
features for the price.
ease of use,many features not often found in a compact excellent value for money
image stabiliser and zoom reach
moving up from the canon powershot a75 to the a7210 is was a very pleasant upgrade.  the image quality due to the increased pixel count is very noticeably improved.  also the image stabilisation works excellently - am finding that there are many more photos pin sharp now.  its also a nice solid camera in the hand.  the larger screen is also a major bonus to me over the old 1.8 inch.
well built, great optical zoom, aa battery capacity, fits well in hand, good video capability.
all good
zoom and image quality
high resolution are suberb features.
image quality is fantastic

brilliant hand held camera for the price. never had a problem with it well over 1000 photos taken
the on screen instruction manual is very helpful.
user friendly and very compact , good quality of images ....
face detector
good quality compact camera. simple to use an upgrade from my previous camera. plenty of clever but useful features such as anti-shake and panorama assistance.
excellent image quality combined with a range of manual modes.  6x zoom optical lens.  takes pleasing pictures in all conditions.  requires just two aa batteries.
the batteries that were supplied are still in it and i use my camera everyday and the memory card is good enough if you upload daily on to your pc
excellent value for money as i used to own a film slr years ago and wanted a small didgital camera where i could be in control of the pictures. was surprised how good quality the video recorded was.
build quality, easy to use and fits the hand well, with a nice clear viewfinder.
sheer versatility
very well featured for price with everything from novice fully automatic to creative control. responsive handling. good image quality. impressive zoom range. good battery life.
it has all the manual settings. quite quick between pushing the button and the photo being taken. small enough to be taken everywhere i go which is what i was looking for.
the image quality is excellent as you would expect from a canon but i selected this model because of its 6x zoom. build quality is good and i also like the size. it's smaller than my old a40 but not so small i can't use it.
i have found it reasonably easy to use and the pictures i have taken so far have all been good quality.
manual controls
price for the product and specification is excellent.
basically can do the whole point and shoot but also has more advanced features should you want to use them
light , big clear screen -  quite simple to use
image quality is fantastic, particulalry in good light. i've used panasinic, sony  and nikon and this is by far the best which is why i baught a second one for my daughter
flash results
large screan, instant focus, good weight, fair tele. simple.
image stabilisation, good optical zoom, aa batteries
the product is compact and lightweight and produces good clarity pictures. it can be as easy to use as you want as it has an auto option which produces good quality pictures. even takes good quality photos in bad light.
lots of features, good image quality and a 6x optical zoom included
easy to use with lots of manual features if you want them..but auto mode really good.  battery life good
the powershot a720 is has many of the popular features at the moment, face recognition, camera shake correction as well as 6 optical zoom and 8 mega pixels. overall this camera is a nice combination and would suit any person who enjoys taking photos of all sorts of subject.
automatic setting works very well for most shots and focus is accurate and reliable.
i find the picture quality good even on maximum digital zoom.the macro function is also excellent. rapid resetting for the next shot.the image stabiliser woks exceptionally well. the batteries last for ever - even non-rechargeable ones.
can be connected to mains using universal adapter.  great manual control features.  great image quality, good usability.
optical viewfinder
for the price the spec is superb and easy to use but with full manual if required
manual very basic but can download a fuller copy from he  diac

so easy to use looks well smart very large screen with brilliant images.
the limited delay between pressing the button to the time picture is taken - never miss anything anymore
compact with lots of useful features. not many similar cameras have a viewfinder which i think is essential.
sd card
i love it, has loads of features, amazing picture quality, easy to use, fast start up and response times.
good battery life
good to have an optical view finder.  it took me a couple of days of endless playing but have now mastered all the basic functions.  there are endless permutations for manual changes for which you need a good understanding of how a camera lens works but i don't suppose the results would be much different to those achieved by using 'auto'!
good clear pictures even at the very simplest of settings
great point and shoot camera or you can have the versatility to be more creative. the optical and digital zoom is also good, with the cameras video quality working remarkably well. optical image stabalizing is a great bonus for the price and has functioned well. a great macro, down to 1cm. it takes aa batteries, great for travelling! in all i have been very pleased with the performance of the camera after spending several months looking around.
it's a compact slr based product and a good complement to an slr. it's versatile, allowing both auto and manual options, zoom capability is great, and size ideal for ease of portability.
fantastic quality at the price.  very easy to use but also lots of features.
it is easy to use and has lots of features for a bit of creativity
lovely pictures, fairly easy to use, image stabilisation, viewfinder etc. more to explore with this camera.
comfortable to hold, simplicity itself on automatic, plus lots of manual exposure and other options.
really quick at taking photos and photos are great quality even with the massive zoom.
loads of technical features that take you beyond a simple point and shoot. amazing closeup shots and image quality.
slow shutter lag after half press to set focussing and exposure set.
good value, good quality, lots of features
good size. small but large enough to grip comfortably and handle. easy to carry around and functions are easy to use...and lots of them. easy to download and sort on the computer.
excellent combination of resolution and optical zoom combined with image stabilisation technology
good little camera
easy to get great pics, video really good, 6 times zoom useful, uses aa batteries so you can never be stuck without power.

good for holding, ease of use for beginners, plenty of good features for more experienced people
easy to use, excellent quality,great screen
reasonably simple to use
aa battery i liked than li ion battery.
the image quality is very good. 95% of pictures are in focus.
my first digital very pleased.
for a small camera there is an excellent zoom, enabling you to take wildlife pictures withut carrying a massive lens about, and it is still small enought to be used in your handbag on nights out. has fully automatic features and fully manual features and everything in between. for a camera with so many features it is easy to use. also takes ordinary size batteries, so if you run out you can easyily get a replacement in shops any where in the world.
excellent results from an easy to use camera
camera bag is not bulky and fits the camera well.
8 megapixels, 6x zoom, good choice of shooting styles, good quality pictures for a camera of this price, excellent value for a canon.

the picture quality is too good and its a excellent camera
the ease of setting the camera to fully automatic or manual and the preset functions are great, especially the kids/pets mode! the best bit is that i was expecting the camera to waste batteries but i've found this not to be the case!
not reliant on lcd monitor, conventional viewfinder provided as well.  loads of features but mostly relevant + well-organised.  easy to handle.  compact dimensions.  good macro-focus.  good software support.
easy to use even for a novice like me.gives exactly what it says it can do without any fuss
a very versatile camera,with its manual settings,good for experimenting!
going on holiday it will be nice not to have to take a heave charger and not be stuck on a day out with a flat battery as i can allways have a couple of spares with me.
the camera is very easy to use with clear icons on the lcd screen for each mode. i particularly like the choice of different picture settings and the manual control. also the screen is great in low light conditions, as it enhances the image to make framing your subjects easier.
good battery life
great picture quality and colour.  optical image stabililisation and viewfinder.  manual control.  can fit additional lenses.
large viewing screen
large display - makes it a lot easier to review your photos and delete the bad ones before you download them onto the pc

excellent small camera, with very good picture quality.  small enough to fit in my handbag.  even has a chidlren and pet mode for those fast moving objects!  even though most info says iso is not as high as some cameras, on the camera there is an iso 3200 mode.  once you have experimented a bit, it is fairly intuitive.

i spent a long time researching what camera i wanted to by; i'm not an expert photographer or anything but i love playing around with them and it was important to me to get a good quality one.  my previous camera had been the model before this and i loved it, unfortunately i made the mistake of taking it on nights out and university and after many drops it finally broke. however, this is such an upgrade. far superior, with many more features that i have yet to discover but also don't feel the need to just yet. i love canon's and will continue to by them. they have excellent battery power and the photo quality is incredible, with crisp images. my favourite feature so far is 'macro digital' which astounds me with its precision.
good quality.
easy to use.
very easy to use, good clear shots even when subject is moving! battery lasts a long time aswell. sleek slim design, good size screen

fantastic little camera - well made and easy to use, with excellent image quality
really easy to take pictures and video clips within seconds of turning on. nice big clear screen, good viewing angle and works well in low light. the best bit is strangers find it easy to use so you can get group pictures that are not out of focus with you in it.
excellent image quality, light, easy to operate, no fuss.
easy to use, great screen, good features.
has replaced a stolen canon.
it was excactly what we were looking for and came highly recommended
easy to use compact camera that produces excellent pictures, good firm build quality gives the cameras a very reassuring feel to the camera.
plenty of features (almost too many!); great pictures; good-sized monitor; fairly robust (i've broken too many cameras).
lovely big screen
large screen helps to point and shoot.
lovely big screen!!
point and shoot ability brilliant
it does everything i need it to do plus it has extra features that i may want to use as i get more experienced with digital photography. 10 mil too.
this is really easy to use and gives great results - even better than my previous ixus 70 (which i was really pleased with), especially in lower light conditions.
excellent image quality, get an 8gb card for loads of space. easy to learn and set-up and use manual features rather than point and click!
teh general use of the camera is gd and it does everything anyone would want with gd photos.

i like the way it is stainless steel, all the other canon ones of its kind are plastic and they look cheap. massive 3 inch screen. easy to use.
speed when opening camera, instantly ready to take picture.  when taking picture it does, not like my old olympus that thinks about taking the picture then the moment has gone.
good solid design,large viewing screen,lots of features, good quality pictures,good compact size.
large easy to see screen,even in sunlight,compared to previous camera

excellent quality
small, lightweight yet many features.  good quality image with good auto functions on iso and focus.  i really like the colour swap and highlight features too.
good, quick start-up time.  solidly built for the most part; small; good looking piece of kit.  lcd screen is good and suggests picture quality is high, but as i don't tend to print photos out in hard copy very often i cannot comment on how they come out in print.  overall, this seems to me to be a very good camera.
image quality very good, although i think that the image stability makes some pictures look a little false. great zoom, where the image stability comes into its own. good macro and generally a good quality product.
image quality and build quality v. good.  colours very realistic.
the biggest bonus though is the viewfinder as the real-time screens on most cameras are very difficut to see in bright sunlight. however the screen on this model is better than most.
easy to use, compact and with good features
high quality poicture;p good close up facility
i like the viewfinder
useful - if simple viewfinder.

great camera ,compact light good features and great optical zoom
very well made product and easy to operate,high quality photos.i chose this camara as it was the 6th canon model i have purchased including a ixus 39,40,80 and previously 2 sure shot models all of which have given me excelent service,
like everything about it
this is virtually muppet proof, very easy to use but provides exceptional quality photos. highly recommended
very easy to operate, even my 8 year old grandson took some great pictures. fantastic night pictures and symbol shows in full screen so easy to read. lightweight and does not feel cumbersome as i recalled from slrs of twenty years ago. i think this will rekindle my interest in photography and make me more adventurous again.
this is a great value camera.  plenty of features, easy to use and so much better than smaller digital cameras.  i should have bought a slr years ago.  it takes a picture so much quicker so that you don't miss the moment which is so important when photographing children.  a compact digital camera can take almost a second to actually take a picture, as soon as you click the button on the eos 1000d the picture is taken. you can also set it to shoot at 3.5 frames per second which is also useful.
having been an amateur photographer for over 40 years i find this one of the easiest cameras  i have ever used.in full manual the creative possibilities are amazing and with the i.s lens it is possible to get shots that were only dreamed of before.an amazing camera.
excellent picture quality. i had a great day out at westonbirt arboretum and took over 150 pictures from landscapes to macro close ups  all the  pictures were excellent. it was great to be able to just point and shoot or take time to compose the picture properly this is my fourth digital camera but the first slr digital. the best yet.
i found it very straightforward and easy to use.  there's a range of automatic settings and a wide range of manual options, eg for different filter effects in black and white photography. this was my first digital slr camera and it had an easy to follow instruction booklet and took no time at all to get going. the image manipulation software was easy to install and has a useful range of functions.
easy to use, lots of features for the price, lovely photo quality.
excellent pictures quality and ease of use for someone who wants to point and shoot whilst offering loads of features for more experienced users.
image quality is just amazing compared to the previous compact camera i had which was always out of focus. overall i am very happy with my pruchase. i love it!
exactly the sort of camera you need when first using an slr
i am a beginner and love this camera. brilliant value for money.
excellent value. comfortable grip/size/wieght. vey good images
so much lighter and easier to use than rival nikons. i'm very impressed with this camera, it's my first dslr purchase after months of borrowing and testing various models.
one would expect.
very easy to use.  takes great pictures at a fast speed so you can catch the kids just when they smile!!!
lots of preset settings so you can get started straight away. then there's hours of fun to be had, fiddling with all the advanced settings.
feels great to use and superb build quality for the money. can easily be used as a simple point and shoot or you can take manual control and tinker with the settings. perfect starter digital slr.
excellant camera , i was going to buy the 450d but im glad i didnt , the price differance is a lot and the picture quality of this camera is fantastic , i have had a couple of photos blown up to a3 size and the quality remains the same . i have always used a slr and would recomend this to anyone.
it is very easy to use and is of a make that you know means good quality. comes with very clear instructions and takes very good quailty pic's.
1. easy to use. 2 picture quality is excellent. 3 zoom facility is excellent. overall the camera gives excellent value for money i would recomend it to anyone wishing to buy a digital camera.
creative photographer. excellent quality images. built in flash works well.  long battery life.  overall this is a good entry level digital slr camera.
very easy to use.  produces some excellent photos.  very easy to download the images onto a pc.
light, easy to use even for a begineer,
this is my first proper camera so wanted something affordable that would give really good quality. the features are really easy to use but has been helpful to have a friend that knows about them to get it all set up for me. the pictures are excellent and everything easy to download onto the computer. would highly recommend it for both amateur and professional shots.
i have been waiting to dip my toe in with a dslr but have been put off by the cost and complexity, i need not have worried this has all the functions of a point and click and add-on\x92s of an slr, but not a massive cost, its real fun getting around the functions, i have been taking pictures of flowers to get to grips with it, everyone has said wow when they have seen them, what more can i say? you like taking good pictures get one, good snapping!
very easy to use, and for the price has amazing image quality. the transition from point and shoot to entry level dslr is not a particularly difficult step, however, it's not just pick up and go.
i'm a novice photographer but i've found it easy to use - the instruction manual is comprehensive and easy to follow. i'm thrilled with it.
this is my first dslr, my previous canon point and shoot is ixus40, so it was about time to get a new one. i am really pleased with the quality of photoes, and ease of use plus amazing price.
i've only had this for a short time but everything i've shot comes out great
good clear images. easy to use and lightweight
fantastic, striaghtforward camera with all the buttons in the right place for ease of use, especially as this is all relatively new to me.  the photo techniques that are waiting to be explored make every taking picture exciting.  i'm sorry i just don't have more time to experiment with all the features!  the camera can be easily used by anyone in fully automatic mode with amazing results for pointing and shooting. then, the presets are there for those wanting to go that bit further and the custom settings allow you to do most things an amateur would want. battery life has lasted surprisingly long so far.
at the moment i am still getting used to the camera but so far i have found it easy to understand.  if you dont want to spend time setting up more complicated artisic shots it can still be used as a point and shoot on auto mode with the added benefit of good quality photos and without the shutter lag that you get on the majority of most non slr point and shot cameras
i'm new to dslrs, but this is easy to use and i absolutely love it!
i was able to use my old ef zoom lens with all features available
light weight of product
great pictures, easy to use. ideal first dslr. kit lens is very good, considering.
the image stabilizer worked a treat, all images came out clear even those on a moving subject.
reputable company with extensive range of lenses available.
snaps, as well as the manual options for more calculated shots.
handbook is well written and it is easy to understand
easy to use, you can get straight into taking pictures, then sit back and play
easy to use, very intuitive, very light
build and ease of use
overall, lots of features packed in smaller budget. lightweight yet lots of things incorporated (at the cost of quality of the camera-body material).
very good value just took it to thailand for 1 month took 400 photos without recharging it easy to use great pictures
clear instructions, easy manageable control buttons.
loads of features for the price
this camera is just so easy to use with excellent results
value for money, terrific quality, build and feel is superb, digital slr at an amazing price
lightweight and easy to use
its easy to use and the quality of the pictures is very good.
easy to use on automatic, good quality definition photos
easy to use and the quality of the pictures are very good quolity, user instructions are very easy to follow
light to hold very modern very reasonable price  very happy
price for the feature set you get is amazing!
eos100d + 18-155is lens is a really excellent value for money product providing a great entry point to the world of slr digital photography. the product seems very well well engineered and is sturdily built - it should last for many years provided it is treated with care. i have used film-based slr's before (for their sheer range of use, clarity of image, range of add-on lenses and versality) and i also own a small digital canon powershot that i carry around. my new eos100d offers the benefits of both cameras; the quality and versatility of the slr plus the sheer convenience of digital photography.
light weight, canon quality, excellent features at reasonable cost.
easy to operate
clear screen, easy to use pretty much straight from the box.
camera is easy to use, the lowish score is because i have not tried everything fully. pictures are flawless, auto focus seems to work far better than anyothers i have tried. i have a class 10 sdhc card 16gb fitted, which says it will take some 3300 pictures on the highest setting, more than enough. battery has a very good life, and will quite happily last a whole day, which is very goog news. nightime photo's are a real plus.
has all the basic slr user would want,very good picture quality.
great manuals for the camera both on cd and hard copy.
quick set up and easy to use
cheap
simple to use and great quality pictures. i was very wary with my first step into digital slr photography but this camera has made it a real pleasure.
i was pleased with my canon eos 400d, but the opportunity arose here to upgrade both the system and the lens (is), at a good price. the camera performs even better than the 400d, and is simple and effective to use. a good buy.
good entry level slr, i'm new to slr and find some of the features daunting, on auto its a doddle to use and the image quality is excellent
good accuracy, auto focus reliable, love that it can fit all canon lenses !
excellent camera as a first digital slr, easy to use and lightweight.
image quality and canon build are the main good points
the auto-focus function does a better job than i could at the moment and saves me having to plough through the book. takes a better picture than my little digital which was the intended purpose of the purchase.
as a first time buyer i did depend on previous reviews to help make my descision......and i am not let down. amazing picture quality and photograph options (portriat, night....) a star all round. i bought as part of the bundle so got case and memory card which i would recommend doing for that little bit extra cash
just cant put it down so easy to use great pics
ease of use with a good number of more detailed operation.good weight.
easy to use well built a nice camera.
typical canon quality. easy to use with clear viewing screen. i bought this as my move from 500n into digital slr's.
ease of use (my 2 year old daughter loves to take photos with it) and the quality of the photos.  very lightweight for a digital slr
ease of use, excellent build quality.
this produce is good for some just starting photography but then you realize after a few weeks into your course you are better spending a little bit more and getting more features.
excellent picture quality and speed
easy to use for a slr beginner. good picture quality
easy to use, its a good beginers camera. lightweight.
full manual controls with the ability to shoot in raw format - as well as full auto mode so the camera operates in point and click mode if required. image quality is excellent, good battery life and quality build you'd expect from canon.
images much better than a compact camera
it my first canon camera, and its very good would buy canon again, and would recommend to friends as a good starter, its picture quality is great,
great entry point product
lense can be detached for use with telescope. good quality for night-time use.
very easy to use. a lot less complicated than i expected. the auto feature, makes it as simple as a compact camera. i have had real fun snapping away learning about the camera. love it.
after being recommended this camera as being a good starter into digital slr  photography and having previously owned several canon compact cameras i decided to purchase.  i am very pleased with its performance and ease of use.
typical canon build quailty. very good
easy to use, great pictures, cost
light weight
good quality camera with excellent features and easy to hold while using it.
really light and very user friendly. everyone should buy one!
good beginers camera,being fully automatic gets you used to the camera, built in flash a good addition.
1. lens 2. quality of the photos 3. changing the level of brightness of the flash is very handy
i bought this for my daughter to do her college course. nice bit of kit. low score on ease of use is my view due to the vast stuff it does. but overall looks stylish, light enough to use over long periods and excellent photo's. (once you've learnt to use it.)
great camera, not too large, plenty of features to get to grips with
well put together, image quality really is excellent, the lens i ended up with (the 18-55 is) really is quite good.
the camera is wonderful - well built, easy to use with pretty much all the features i need for astrophotography.
just about everything
i bought a canon particularly as i have a canon eos slr and the lenses, and cokin filters, i have are compatible, the main feature i like. it has all of the features of my slr but is digital.  apparently it shoots hd video as well but i've not got that far yet.
user friendly,easy to follow instructions
not being a technical person, it takes a while to get used to everything it can do and how to do it justice, but i'm getting there. the instruction manual is very helpful.
ease of use, readily available add ons ie lens
it takes no time at all from switching it on to taking a photograph, the functions on the wheel are all very useful and the build of the camera and design is pleasent to hold.
easy to use from the off. the full auto will give excellent results whilst you take time to use the raft of other features. if you are new to digital this is an amazing piece of kit.
easy to use, takes clear pictures very good camera
great quality camera, very easy to use and good quality pictures.
easy to use, good quality photo's, lightweight to handle
fantastic image quality. i use it mostly for sports events with canon's 55-250 is zoom lens.
excellent images, it doesnt have to be complicated if you dont want it to be
it was my daiughters first slr. she loves it, easy to use and great picture quailty.
great camera - and my eos lenses from my film eos camera work on it as well
my dad has the same camera and i needed to use it for a level art and media but it was never around so saved up my money and bought one for myself i am 17. love using it so do my friends it will last me for a very long time all through uni too
light and versitile, looks good and handles well. the pictures look good and the quality was decent.
easy to use, brilliant picture quality.
easy to use with a quick start up time and very easy to use. it is sized really well. i have v big hands and have no problem and my wife is dinky and we both have no problem.
a nice  camera to buy for the next step up from a pocket one, it will take a bit of use to get the feel of it,  i think good quality photo`s will follow ,  i like this one.
bought it for my husband he is pleased with it
ease of use and good quality images. still early days yet to comment any further - i'm still learning !
just what i wanted up to now no prublems
easy to use auto settings.
the camera is on problem to use
particularly useful for taking pictures in low light situations, such as museums where flash is prohibited. the image stabiliser seems to work very well, and some of my pictures in the recent exhibition of tutankhamun replicas in manchester bear comparison with professional photos in books.
image quality is very good.  weight and shape of camera makes it easy to handle.
bought for daughters gcse course on recommendation of teacher
everything
does exactly what it says on the tin.   full manual mode sounds complicated at first but actually very easy so well worth diving in and moving beyond auto shoot.
shot!
great value for money
great photos, easy to use.
good product
great camera especially as new to dslr's
easy to use. a good beginner camera
easy to use and light with a good selection of lens that will fit it

ease of use and image quality
image quality is good and focus points a great help
excellent value for money, light and compact camera that's easy to carry around and with wonderful results
good value for the money
easy to navigate menu system. all shooting functions eh aperture/shutter priority are easy to shift between. all buttons are within easy reach when hands are on the camera.
shoot are excellent, however to a more experienced person plenty of buttons to fiddle with and dials to turn. good easy to use software that came with it.
easy entry level from compact digital to dslr. i wanted the ability to change lenses and that is what i got.
this is my first slr digital and have no experience but all the automatic features make photograpy quite easy and if you take enough photos then you are bound to get a good few snaps along the way. the tamron telephoto lense 70/300 is amazing. i have had this for a few weeks and i have snapped around 600+ images and use a mac to edit them.
easy to use menus.  simple transition from compact to dslr.
easy to use even for a beginner like myself.
the picture quality is excelent and this camera is very easy to use, with a very responsive shutter button
easy to use, great picture quality.  really good as a 1st dslr camera.
this is nice small smart camera same i was looking for. very usable camera anywhere you want. both lens are perfect. pictures very sharp. is many good points in this canon eos 1000d
everything
as a first dslr this is a great product, easy to use and with lots of interesting features to practice with.
this is my first slr camera and am still getting used to all the modes and functions but what i have used of it so far is very impressive for the price.
very easy to use, good picture quality.
very happy with the product i was advised to go for canon or nikon and i am not dissappionted
it's light, easy to use and takes great pictures without much effort on the part of the user!  plenty of different modes depending on the type of picture you are taking, and ideal for short video clips.
small, easy to use, good instructions, good lcd viewer
easy to use and was able to start  taking photos strait away without spending ages reading instruction manuals. is small enough to carry around, especially with all the stuff 2 year old needs with them.
good but not too greater range of picture settings, but can be set up to a very precise level if you wish.
have kept my canon slr (non-digital) but love this digital camera for quick photo taking and downloading and sharing with friends on the same day.  it's easy to use and does all it claims to do!  excellent purchase for the money.
very good value. also easy to use and great quality pictures. very pleased with it indeed.
easy to use.
cheap, good quality pictures
ease of use.
im not an expert photographer and its my first digital camera  but i found it simple to use and pleased with the quality of the photos
love it! simple, easy to use and good quality
does everything stated with ease
its so easy to use, it does what it should do, user friendly
compact, easy to use, simple menu, excellent close focusing.
good quality camera - easy to use as point and shoot
easy to use, small and great to carry around, appropriately placed buttons
macro mode.
all of the above. stunning picture quality - the most important feature.
light and compact
pretty, compact and easy to use i hate needing to read instruction booklets to get a product up and running and with this camera that was nt necessary so i was pleased. ive even dropped it a few times and it hasnt scratched or altered its performance that i can tell so robust too.
good compact camera
very easy to use, does all i want it to
easy to use
its easy to carry and to use.  for those just starting out its ideal you point and shoot in over 500 photos taken i don't think i have had more then 5 out of focus pictures.  the video option is also great to have and we had a lot of fun taking short videos while on our holiday.
very good on close up's
it can in large the image of a face on the lcd screen so it makes it easy to take pictures.
can get very close to objects and still get them in focus eg coins
not too complex
i trust  the cuality of canon
easy to use
good pictures
great value for money.
easy to use-my daughter, who usually takes a while to master technology, had this for her 11th birthday and she picked it up very quickly.  especially like the super macro function for taking close ups.
very easy for my 12 year old daughter to use.  excellent macro facility and video mode.
easily understood instructions for use and linking to computer. software recognised my old inkjet printer immediately so i bought some morre cartridges for it!
easy to use
price - but am a canon-fan
picture quality was good
i owned a canon powershot 80 before so i was already familiar with the canon powershot line.  this made it easy to jump right into using my camera.  much better camera than the powershot 80.  the camera is thinner, more light weight and makes much larger video clips.  picture quality is superb for my use making high quality photos for my websites that i design.
, the canon takes excellent close ups... including this one. lag time is reasonable.
the    anti shake system on this power  shot range i find incredible .as is  the face detection.point and shoot in auto and on etc
easy to hold, excellent picture quality, ease of use with excellent features. optical viewfinder is an asset in bright conditions.
there is a fantastic setting - auto, which detects the best image selection automatically for you e.g. portrait.  therefore feel assured selecting the best picture settings, without having to manually do this myself (i am lazy!)
viewfinder
good view finder
viewfinder - a boon in bright, sunny conditions and why i bought the camera.
small enough to carry everywhere, easy to use, good battery life (2200ma nimh) and takes a good quality picture.
4 x optical zoom takes good pictures even in poor lighting conditions. auto setting covers most situations and other settings are easy to learn. optical view finder ideal for situations such as fast moving pictures. good quality pictures for this price range of camera.
the as1100, is a well designed and built unit. though not the slimest compact it feels very comfortable to handle and thus encourages confidence to use the unit. the screen is very clear and the control dial easy to read and use. video capture and play back are excellent.
takes photos fast, which is what i was looking for to take photos of my baby.
the camera shake feature is excellant on this , generally very easy to take photos. batteries are standard aa .
compact with all the features of a larger camera and easy to use
ease of use for snap taking with great canon colour
auto function is great
very light and small plus also very well built and robust.
easy to use
it's small and slim, lightweight and pocketable.
light and small, yet takes great pictures.
it has an eye viewer; the image screen is useless in sunshine ie the tropics.  good choice of settings and is the right size for hand and pocket.  it sems to be stronger made than some others on the market which have failed when the telephoto software breaks down.  a useful small camera and good back-up.
has a proper viewfinder.
very easy to use
easy to use for a beginner
simple to use and very good quality
just such an amazing picture and simple to use.
very good
ease of use  good pictures
lightweight, compact fairly easy to use
pretty good image quality
what i expected after reading reviews - a simple to use camera with enough controls to cope with the more unusual conditions. easy to use as i had a powershot family camera before.
compact,ease of use,large view screen
compact but quite good results
ease of use. point and shoot providing very good images for the type of camera it is. good for most situations.compact and easily carried
a worthwhile every day camera
good build quality, excellent pictures, plenty of features to play about with.
optical viewfinder is a must for sunny days or when on holiday my main and also for concerts when not allowed to take pics they cant see the light on your lcd, also to take vids at concerts - not allowed.. the macro feature is great i did a test pic of one with and one without macro the result is amazing. this also takes pics really fast. its well worthe the extra money.
point and shoot.even my wife can use this camera with ease and she is not at all technically minded. this was a priority for us as we are not camera buffs. the macro is excellent. the software is straightforward enough and within minutes i had excellent pictures downloaded to the pc. suggest you buy the 4gb card for what it costs. camera feels solid and is a nice size for the pocket.
really good image quality and it takes the picture as soon as you press the button rather than a second later so have missed the moment
small, stylish, compact. excellent picture quality. love the image stabilisation feature, no more blurry shots! excellent focusing.
because of the colour you can't miss it.
easy to handle and very easy to use with brilliant picture quality and a fantastic zoom
easy to use and compact enough to slip in a pocket and feel comfortable
brilliant camera window.  many features, some of which are still to be explored.  improved switching between stills and video to prevent accidental use of video.
small and light.  viewfinder can be used in bright sunlight. rechargeable battery
easy to use out of the box
some very good features that i havent had before like continous shots - excellent idea !
picture quality is very good. very user friendly. ideal size for slipping into your pocket.and looks good
the small size and ease of use.you can view photos taken without switching on the camera.the best thing,and this is why i chose it, is the viewfinder as with my previous camera (an excellent panasonic which i sat on and broke the screen)i could not see the screen in bright sunlight. a bonus is that the zoom is done on the viewfinder as well as the lens so it is approaching my old film slr.
very easy to use. night shots captured really well without flash. sturdy design.
this is a great camera, very user friendly with a simple short guide to how to get going and the option of installing the cd for lots more detail. the camera replaces an older much slower one. i like the battery system - so easy and speedy to set up and recharch; so far it seems to have a long charge. i have used the camera a lot and for flash and i really have not noticed a drain on the battery and have only topped it up just in case. its got a view finder - useful in sunny conditions - my old camera has a view finder so i know how useful it can be.  slim and easily slides in handbag or pocket.  can be used on auto which does/controls every thing for you or there is the option to do your own controlling. all the menu is so eay to use and understand. i am really pleased that i choose this camera and am getting excellent photos.
well built compact camera, easy to use with great image quality.
excellent quality and value for money. optical viewfinder is especiaaly under very bright conditions, e.g. bright sun on beach.
neat compact camera.  takes excellent photos. easy to use.  excellent value for money.  i purchased this camera for my daughter and she is very pleased with it and the results it produces.
a good to take anywhere camera, slips into handbag or pocket as long as i can get it befor my grandaughters who love using it because it is so easy.  the results are excellent and compare well with a more expensive camera.  love the colour!
i was given one of these cameras for my birthday and loved it.  my boyfriend was impressed so i bought him one for xmas!  the picture quality is amazing for a compact camera and it's a great price for a camera that has a large viewing screen and a viewfinder.
it is small and easy to carry and use
it shows the preview of the centre focus prior to taking the photo. fast recovery after every snap. recommended for point and shoot users as the settings have been automatically optimised by the camera.
it's lovely - really compact but with great zoom and screen image.
image quality, menu easy to use
excellent, all-round compact;. stunning images even at 12x zoom (optical+digital that is). just does a great job, whoever is holding it. can't fault it.  tiny - so wife loves it too.
neat, solidly built good optics for the money
the item is very light and and compact i love the colour and the many features of the camera dissapointed that the camera does not come with even a cheap case as some lesser model so
this is my first canon and i am extremely pleased with it, the main reason for purchase was the viewfinder as i had had problems before in bright sunshine with the screen reflecting. it takes excellent pictures and was very easy to use.
great little camera, a lot camera for the price, this is the 2nd ixus i have purchased, i liked the ixus 82 is that i bought my daughter for christmas  09, that when this ixus 95 came up at a great price i couldn't resist updating from my olympus
it is easy to use and compact to put into a hand bag. the picture quality is just great. the view finder also helps when taking pictures.
great size for fitting into a small hand bag, takes great pictures can't wait to take it on holiday!
this is a great camera.  it is so small it fits into a pocket.  i read a lot of reviews before buying and i have not been disappointed.  it is fantastic for just pointing and shooting.  i find it very easy to use.
easy to use with good results
great design, compact, superb build quality. price. the pictures are sharp and colours bright.
its small ,takes perfect pictures ,had a good deal on price ,love canon cameras this is a cracker really recomended,

very easy to use, and the video quality is remarkably good, with good sound. it slips easily into a shirt pocket, so very convenient.
on off button rather small
design
i doubt if you could get a better camera with better features for the money.  i was really impressed with the video too, for such a small camera.
only thing i don't like about it is that it is a little small for my large hands - but most would like that. extremely light too. is also a which best buy
it is so easy to use especially if you are an older person and not really used to modern equipment
fast start up. easy to use. quality photos
this is a great camera to use for its simplicity and easy to understand instructions, producing high quality images. small and compact and has prodoced some excellent detailed images of my art work.
the only problem, as with all cameras with live view, is the difficulty seeing the picture in bright sunlight, but it does have an optical viewfinder to help.
looks good, well built, easy to use, small enough to carry around everywhere you go. long battery life between charges. takes good pictures. more importantly it has a view finder as well as screen on back so can prolong battery life when charging is difficult (when on holiday camping!)
very easy to use and really good quality pictures. lightweight but doesn't feel cheap.
this is a really easy camera to just pick up and use. plus it has the added benefit of many extras that i haven't used yet. in particular the zoom facillity is great and there is very little delay on taking the picture.
great pictures!
it is easy to use and produces excellent images. it is small and fits easily into your pocket. the eye level viewfinder is an excellent advantage when bright sunlight makes it difficult to get a clear view in the normal screen.

so far, it ticks all my boxes, although i haven't yet had time to work with the video bit; still at basic, having come off a fairly basic non-digital point and shoot.
basic controls, good quality photos, slim and compact, by far the best camera on the market for the price
easy to use; quick to power up, quick to take shot, excellent video quality.  quick and easy to review images and transfer to pc.
it is really easy to use and so light. i love the colour as well!

easy use, great pictures and easy downloads/transfer to computer
larger lcd screen a boon for instant setting and viewing shots, battery life more than adequate,all the good features of the 350d and a few more.

picture quality is excellent
great photos
features seem quite intuitive to use. can be used quickly when needed. light enough for hauling up a mountain.
a very easy to use and stylish camera that takes high quality professional pictures in all conditions time after time. i'm looking to extend the range of use by purchasing more lenses but haven't yet made up my mind which to but first.
image quality is fantastic especially with sigma 70-300mm macro lens
the images are phenomenal, you can get some really impressive pictures and effects with minimal fuss, using the pre-set potrait and macro modes.

amazing camera - photo quality is awesome. really pleased with every aspect of camera!
this is great to use from the start - easy quick start with it.  also think it looks great too!  the camera bag i got free with it has proved to be a great gift as it holds everything you need.  just need the time to get out and about to start using it to it's full potential.
really easy to use and with great results.
quality of picture
eos slr.
as a  novice it is super easy to use great professional finish love it.
compatible with eos lens system
fantastic camera for price
a good quality product.
as you would expect from canon, a superb dslr with very little to fault.
compared with my compact cameras, including a lumix lx3, the 500d takes really high quality photos right up to iso 1600.
zoom range is outstanding one lense does all, just what i wanted. large lcd screen, picture quality is very good.
an excellent superzoom. no need to keep changing lenses. great when travelling
15mpixels - great for large prints. 3 frames/second on continuous shooting to catch fleeting expressions during portrait shoots. very fast write to card time.  fast startup. live view.
very low battery consumming ,even at very cold tempurature (several days below 0, just the batteray very kept warm when not used especially at night)
excellent build quality, image quality and versatility - this latter thanks to the 18mm - 200mm lens.  the siftware supplied with the camera is also excellent and very easy to use.
the lens kit does exactly what i want it for and as i am an amateur i dont have enough experience to give you a report on the lens kit
big camera and lens combination to carry around, but if you have it you will want to use it and it produces great results.
just a joy to use
easy auto, good pictures, great lense.  will take ages to learn how to use all the features - steep learnig curve!  i'm happy i chose it though.
the canon 500d is lightweight...packed with features and takes remarkable photographs...easy for a beginner to pick up and start shooting while also professional enough for an advanced photographer to use
if you want a good deal then you can do a lot worse than buy the 500d with twin lens kit.i also brought a trek bag and 8 gig shdc card with the camera and it still cost less than the 550d.
great camera for the price and came with 2 lenses which really gave me the boost in camera equipment.
i cannot find anything but good points with this camera,it has all that i expected and then some.the presets are fantastic, taking the headache out of having to figure out how to get the best shot,but also has manual control for the more discerning.the lenses  supplied  with the camera  are amazing and simply open up a world of possibilities.this package with all its extras has exceeded my expectations and in a word is quality.
image quality is awesome. it's an amazing camera and getting everything to go with it is the perfect way to get anyone started.
a feature packed winning camera from canon, simple enough for the novice with enough growth potential to keep even the most ardent enthusiast hooked for a life-time.  the capacity of the camera will greatly exceed that of the average user.
light and easy to handle by comparison to other makes i have owned. quiet shutter which does not scare the animals or birds away.
the camera is just so beautiful. i got it for my 18th birthday, and it was - although expensive - the best present i could have ever imagined. the lenses are easy to put on and take off, and once you get used to them, they take the most stunning shots. the canon 500d takes such wonderful photos, whether its artsy ones or simple point and click at a birthday party. i would really recommend it to anyone!
both lenses are cannon so you can be certain that they are to the best build quality and fit to the camea body perfectly. the camera is easy to use straight from the box and with time and practice  the more advanced options become second nature. dvd supplied is very useful for the novice.
great camera, it's my first slr and using the automatic features is great. point and shoot. i take it almost everywhere with me and the 75-300 lens is great for getting up close, it was a lot better than i anticipated.
the fact that the camera comes with two different lenses seems to make it pretty good value for money; the 70-300mm lens gives some great zoom effects and the 18mm setting gives a reasonably wide angle.
regardless of your previous experience this is a pick up and use camera. even my 11 year old took fab photos on day one. it is really light and the operation of the many features is logical and easy to work out.
great entry point into the world of digital slr's. lots of advanced features and also easy to use for those with little experience.  pictures are a real step up from a normal digital cameras.
the hd video is amazing
big screen, instant replay, adjustable dioptre setting on viewfinder and lightness, 18mp quality. ease of operation
good quality pictures and live view is great for focusing during astrophotography.
all good points so far
great dslr for starters, like myself.
this was my first dslr.  it is great as an entry level.  i took it straight to norway and the sub arctic in the hope of capturing the northern lights.  it did everything i demanded of it and more.  now i am home it is fab for micro photography for my handmade jewellery items.  versatile and could only be beaten by buying the next level up. easy to change lenses whilst on the go too despite frozen fingers!
easy to use even for beginners (like me), the fully auto feature allows you to just point and shoot until you figure out all the manual settings. the sensors for low light (without flash) photography are fantastic, so ideal for museums etc where they wont allow flash photography. the bag is the perfect size to store everything that comes in this bundle pack. the lenses are easy to fit/change. would highly recomend this camera!
only had it 3 weeks but seems to tick all the boxes. easy to use for a numty like me who doesn't want to fiddle about with lots of settings, though there are plenty of settings to fiddle with if one was so inclined.
it will take time to master all the functions and i have no issues at this point relating to the product. i think i purchased the best brand out there for the price i was willing to spend.
ease of use, out of the box, point and click. simple and the image quality is fantastic
it feels good, the controls are all easy to access, the settings are easy to use
love the camera, functionality, the build (even though could of been a little stronger looking), the grip and general feel of the camera.
nice camera, easy to use and good image
well built, easy to just point and shoot but then when you want to be more creative the option is there for you and it's fairly simple.
lots to learn, but it comes with a good manual and canon software. you cant take a bad picture due to the detail captured you just zoom in and trim the image. i have so far just been messing about in the house and garden and have taken the best pictures in my live. well worth the money.
great price, small (compact) for a dslr, image quality is amazing, great for experienced people and beginners.
i purchased this camera as a replacement for my canon eos350d and as back up for my canon eos40d. extremely pleased with the performance and, as a semi-professional sports photographer, i am impressed at how fast the camera processes the images, even at the highest resolution. the sensitivity of 3200 iso, extendable to 6400 or even 12800 is great for taking in low light (great for under floodlights at sports events). overall very pleased with my purchase.
very nice and simple camera
battery life is amazing!!!!!!
fairly complex but not difficult to use with use of manual and practice.
easy to point and shoot.  i still need to learn about how to use it.  excellent training material and courses on offer through canon.
for a beginner, this is a superb, functional camera.
a lot of camera and lens for the money.  very easy to use and master.  very versatile with the 12 600 iso speed.  image quality is superb and easily edited with the included canon software.  a good alround camera without the gimicks.
good auto functions, software makes it easy to download and amend images
very easy to use straight out the box, plus plenty of extras for the more advanced photographer
pictures come out great with 18mp
having purchased numorous dslr previously, i am absolutely amazed at the quality of this camera.  loads of features and so easy to use, that even my 7 yr old boy is taking some fantastic pictures and easily understands the in-built features.  most definately worth the money..  very happy and content customer.
fantastic camera easy to use lightweight and cracking pictures!
light in weight. easy to fit.
easy to use
everything above,ease of use image quality,build quality and value .
image quality, it's not heavy
loads of good points, fast shooting speed, fantastic print quality, really easy to use. fantastic as a 1st dslr.
the price of the body is excellent as is the quality and usability of the product in general.
i am just a beginner but already done some very arty things
i am a bigginer, but with a good look at the manual and practice, wonderful to use
twin lenses to get you started, lcd automatically shuts down when you come to use the eye piece instead of selecting one or the other manually. good layout of settings. live view on screen, most of the buttons you need to use regularly are mostly under one finger. fairly light unit even with 300mm lens on but still has a feeling of quality.
fantastic piece of kit. easy to use on automatic, with plenty of manual functions as well. good overall package with two superb lenses. look forward to many years use.
it takes amazing photos and videos. the camera itself is not that big, so is easy to take about and carry.
for a beginner the best is offered by canon.good features.easy to use.good quality. the tamron lens does the job well, i love it.
very quick auto focus, excellent battery life. comfortable camera to use, and not over weight. very good package with excellent choice of lenses in the bundle that provide great coverage for all focal ranges.
good all round camera
great camra
great picture quality
really love this camera, easy to use and start clicking staight away.i used my brothers before i brought my own one as loved it so much.think it says it all.
battery life is great.
easy to handle and plenty of programs plus full manual use
cannon products always good
good value
very new to dslr but this appears to do everything a beginner needs
easy to use, the extra lens is great as i would have probably bought one later if it wasn't included.
price and quality of product
my first ever slr camera and its so easy to use and wish i had bought one years ago! superb value for money with the xtra lens. excellent battery life
light in weight initally very easy to set up and get shooting. as you get more familiar with camera you then can get to grips with the details and many features.
overall a very good camera.
easy to use quality product. great pictures!
quality product thats easy to use
ok - it's not a top of the range camera - but it's not a basic snapper either. at 18mp the images come out with all the sharp detail you need and the lenses supplied will do most of the work the average punter will be looking for. definitely a step up from anything else on the market at around this sort of money or less. highly recommended.
nothing bad to say all round good camera :) package deal great value for money.
hope to master it soon!!
really easy to use for a first time slr user
excellent camera consistent with the eos brand. this camera has all the features a keen amatuer would need and produces excellent results. the lens range is great and of usual canon quality.
i love it and this is my first and perfect camera ,, so i recommend this product to all my friend.
easy to use , and amazing picture quality.
ease of handling. clarity of photo.
great lcd display
eos 500d body is a fantastic camera, easy to use weather it is just for basic amature point and shoot or advanced full control of all the settings photography.good value to get a long lense as well as a basic one, eeven iff they ent the best lenses. not too big or heavy if you aren't used to an slr
easy to use, from using set programmes to advanced
amazing camera with great features, definetly worth the money
it is just the best dslr i have used!
settings and the quality of the photo is great. i've been taking photos every day!! battery life so far is about 4 days. great value for money too
really easy to use, lightweight and great build quality. images come out great! the extra lens comes in very handy too!
fun
very versatile and great automatic modes
a good value bundle if you are new to dslrs.
as a novice in photography i found this camera very easy to use and i'm looking forward to many years of snapping away. this is a geat starter kit and look forward to adding other lenses as the years go by.
solid feel, controls all easy to reach, so many features - not for the faint-hearted.
good quality build and easy to use
excellent value for money.
everything
great value for mid-entry dslr.
this is the first dslr i've bought. my friend has the same one and i had a go and was impressed by it so i went and got one. it's very easy to use and takes great pictures without messing around with loads of settings. it does everything i need it to do. managed to get some great slow shutter shots.
the camera is still quite new so i have a lot to learn still, but it's very easy to use which is important as i'm a total amateur. the pics i've taken look very professional and are great quality, on the simplest settings. the camera is very light and other people who've used it love it too.
if you are familiar with slr (digital or old 35mm) cameras  it's easy to pick up and use.
i don't know all that much about photography yet but have got some great photos so far.
full auto means you can just point and press and achieve great results. really lightweight and easy to handle
lens supplied in package
very easy to use as a simple auto settings
good beginners dslr. switch on and the camera is instantly ready for action. no shutter delay after pushing the button. loads of easily changed options for the more advanced photographer.
fantastic camera if you want to start to become professional photographer. the combination of the 2 lenses is the also a strong point. took the camera on holiday and when i came back i couldn't believe when i was watching the photos on my led tv: the quality is superb. money well spent. what impressed me is the iso  which can get images in the shadowy room whitout using the flash.
you can set up the picture on the view screen before taking it (lighting, fine focus etc) and getting to grips with all the functions is quite easy
easy to use menu, easy to reach every button, light weight
great package. many useable features.
a sturdy, light case that is comfortable to hold. i have found it very easy to access the menus and features. only ever having used cameras on automatic setting, i have quickly begun to get to grips with this camera's semi-manual and manual settings and am achieving some very pleasing results after only a very short time. i'm looking forward to even better photos as i learn to master the camera's true potential. very good value for money for a keen beginner.
this is the 1st good camera i've bought and im well pleased.  easy 2 use and fab image quality :)
amazing image quality - wish i had bought one of these a long time ago
excellent camera and well pleased with it

took a long time to decide, and this was the best product with the package

similar to previous slr film camera, easy to use despite the complex instruction booklet.

zoom lense very useful.
it is exactly as it says on the tin. perfect for all and exceptional value for money.
easy to use
cracking camera for a lower end model.  i am a beginner to intermediate user and have taken to this camera very well.  i did go on a crash course to get me up to speed with the general theory of photography. now all the settings make sense and i run the camera fully manual. i haven't used any other models of dslr so i am a poor comparison but i get all the shots i need from this model and i am really please with it.
great pics, compact, great features, the 2nd lens is a must have, also very decent sound when shooting videos too!
amazing image quality and easy to use for anyone who has used a dslr before.
great deal with the extra lens, memory card, battery and bag.

as this is my first dig slr i have found it easy to get to grips with so far
amazing
this is my first slr and i'm really impressed with it. there are lots of features i am yet to use. now i just need some more lenses!
easy to use straight out of the box. good range of operation modes mean you can go from full auto to controlling any individual item such as aperture, exposure time and film speed.
it is all good no bad points

lightweight and easy to use, it is a delight even for an old beginner like me.
nice camera. still learning how to use it.
easy fit of lences

everything
it's good for every day use.

its a canon
good value for money and a great dslr camera.
bought this for my wife as her first slr, has many built in program functions for her to take the basics while learning how to control the more advanced functions better.
lost of great features. although not a fan of movies the hd visoe is great.
easy to use. great range of features. clear images. very happy with the overall quality of this product. great value for money
ease of use, great feel and quality.after much research before buying the two lense deal was an excellant deal.
my first serious camera and i'm delighted with the ease of use, it takes stunning pictures and is a joy to use. one tip is to ensure you read the manual to take full advantage of all the features.
the camera is beautful, light, great setting options and features. amazing quality pictures can be captured even by ameteurs.
ideal for beginners, easy to follow screens and plenty of advice on how to get the most out of the camera
excellent choice of lens' to get started, the camera is way at the top end of entry level, and has many enthusiast features, and being a very recent model, should see you right for a good length of time
i've used a canon before so many of the features/buttons were familiar which helps.  the quality of the pictures really is excellent. this bundle comes with the tamron zoom lens which works really well and represents great value when compared to the genuine canon equivalent and means you can do more straight away.  the case has plenty of room to keep everything safely protected including the uv filters.
stunning picture what more can i say
image quality of the photos os superb!
no comment.
media graduate! good recommendation as they should know what they are on about.
it does everything i need.
good quality build and easy to use
really easy to use, lightweight and great build quality. images come out great! the extra lens comes in very handy too!
very versatile and great automatic modes
excellent, feature rich camera at great price. the twin lenses give you so many options.
as a novice in photography i found this camera very easy to use and i'm looking forward to many years of snapping away. this is a geat starter kit and look forward to adding other lenses as the years go by.
i was a professional press photographer for over 45 years and the 50d and 17 -85 lens are amongst two of the best  pieces of equipment i have used for their price.
the camera itself is brilliant. the fps are brilliant and the 1.6 crop factor is great for that extra reach.
well put together with lots of features and generally overall a lovely camera to operate.
having 15mp plus 6 frames per second the screen for viewing the photos is brilliant
access to many functions has been improved and simplified ie style, information. also quick access to change of iso, white balance, metering leaving less to personal memory. keeping same lens fitting (ef) is great. solid feel gives confidence in structure.
shoot. high iso performance is amazing. great image quality with prime lenses.
megapixels
this was an upgrade from an eos 400d so the step up was very significant.  main points are the build quality, which is what you would expect from a semi-pro camera.  the camera feels very solid and robust and the larger size make it feel more secure when using it.  menu options are more extensive and, once you get used to them, are very intuitive.  image quality is simply unbelievable from the 17-85 is usm lens, with focussing being both quick and quiet. image stabilisation is also a bonus, guaranteeing that more of my images are pin sharp.  early days yet, but so far i am convinced that the camera will more than exceed expectations.
good build quality, digic iv processor is really good at controlling noise, heavy enough that it feels secure in hand but not too heavy, menu is easy to navigate and use, brilliant features for the price.
it is so easy to use in automatic modes, and easy to use in the more creative fields.
i previously owned a eos350d, i find the layout of the buttons and menu interface are much improved and the larger screen gives much better photograph previews. the custom functions are really useful too, i have one of them set-up so that the camera is always set-up for landscape shots.... this saves a lot of time and i never miss a shot now!
strudy metal body, good kit lens
nice weight. comfortable grip. easy to view lcd panel.  image stabilisation system very good.
fantastic camera
easy to start to use - great picture quality - enjoying learning about all the functionality that the camera offers
picture quality
comprehensive with lots of features

easy to use and great results on the move! perfect for pics of moving subjects. love it!!
size
simple and straight forward to use. feels solid and comfortable in the hand. image quality is excellent.
used without a tripod in good light.  macro mode is another advanced feature.  all very impressive!
the macro facility is also superb.
superb built-in lens, equivalent to a 36mm to 432mm slr lens with canon's image stabilisation. live histogram a real bonus, camera responds very fast and has full manual control if you need it. uses aa batteries, forget alkaline and get nimh rechargeables - a set of 2500mah will last for over 600 shots! stereo sound is superb quality and great for adding to slideshows and dvd presentations. swivel live viewfinder display a real creative plus, camera controls feel good and very easy to use without resorting to the manual. movie mode is the best available on a digital camera, macro and super macro modes also great to have!
11. excellent handgrip
well built, excellent picture quality, very good camera
optical zoom
fastest digital slr at 8.2mpixels, well built, full featured camera. a must for wildlife and sports photographers.
built like a tank and very fast.  had no problems after 5 months - love it.
the image quality of this canera is fantastic, its relatively easy to use and when combined with canon prime lenes produces some fantastic results.
beautifully made, ergonomically pleasing to hold. great
uses standard canon lenses, lightweight, high image quality and easy to use.
this is a nice slr,good features ,much better than the 450 d i had before ,you can all ways trust a canon to give top quality pics
simplicity, performance, quality, ease of use.
all the big features of the much more expensive cameras
the image quality and sharpness on the eos 5d is stunning.  the viewfinder is large and bright and the lcd monitor a good size.
very fast, very good pictures (generally)
my reasons for upgrading from 10d:  spot metering, full-frame, higher megapixel count, better performance at high isos, faster speed overall.
image quality, build.
easy to use straight out of the box for anyone use toeos cameras.

excellent camera, features you would expect of this sort of camera. overall feels well built!
shoot
great quality photos, plenty to learn in photography art.
haven't as yet managed to get out and use the camera in earnest, but will be in the next couple of days. initial handling and having taken a few shots to ensure it at least works already fills me with confidence. the 60d feels extremely well built and solid, and totally surpasses my old 400d with its functions etc. the lens also feels well made, zoom and focus rings feel good, no loose movements .. picture quality appears perfectly adequate for my level of photography all in all the upgrade was definately a good choice
good camera for the enthusiastic amateur with loads of manual set options. two or three different ways to get to all the menus including button set functions. just take me a little while to remember were they all are.
great picture quality
fantastic product and i am happy with all the easy to use features
for the cost it's a superb camera.
like me.
nice built, good features for small price.
extremely easy to use

nice large lcd works well in bright light.but a view finder if required in extremely bright sunshine.
cool looking reto style  easy to use good colour red eye feature brilliant
a very good 'point and shoot' easy camera for my wife to use
i take great pictures too..
good pictures for modest cost.
bought it for my seven year old grandson. a good camera.  good value for money.
great little camera, easy to use, yet with all the functions you need. as a novice with a digital camera have found it perfect. easy to load photos onto compter-and i'm not very computer literate either!!
i read through the book first and also asked a professional photographer who told me canon are excellent.
ease of use.
theimage quality is good

metal body,ease of use,picture quality
great features
good quality for the price, with a good range of features.
compact, lightweight with an excllent zoom and picture quality.
best price for this camera, it's also sold as the ixus 125 in horrible colours, or in red at twice the price. the pictures are really good.amazing camera for that price
it is compact, light, easy to pop into a bag 'just in case' you see something interesting when you are out and about, or sling it around you neck in the free camera bag for quick and easy access when you intend to take some shots at an event if on a journey. i extend the camera bag strap so that the camera is at hand level. head shots, crowd scenes and street views - it's easy to compose a good looking sharp shot.
easy to use camera that doesn't cost the earth.  great to have a deal that includes a few extras (ie case, memory card, etc).  overall an excellent product for the price paid.  the hs system is excellent.
comapct and easy to use. good quality images
great and easy to use.  the flip out lcd screen really does come in handy.
exceptional piece of kit, extremely happy with purchase, quality product.
easy to use, feels solid and good quality. the lens combination is excellent. very versatile package.
if your upgrading from a compact you cannot go wrong, it's so easy to use.
it's ability to take my 'l' lenses with the adaptor is great - means it can double as an emergency body
the 22mm f2 lens is a must buy.
i am a complete beginner to dslr but one av and tv was explained to me i found this camera easy to use and it produced great results!
is very easy for use and long batery life
good features for the cost
great sturdy bit of kit
just beginning with camera knowledge is not good but even i managed to go straight out and take pictures.  can't wait to find out what its capable of
excellent camera - pictures are stunning

currently the best compact camera around. packed with features and produces high quality images. i particularly like continuous shot mode so far and i'm still discovering new features daily.
excellent point and shoot pocket cam.
image quality
small and lightweight.
large screen. physical controls as opposed to touchscreen.
very easy to access set up features. the image capture is as you would expect and the video recording is of a higher quality than you might expect. battery life has proven to be very good especially when dealing with video. overall a fantastic camera for the price that has delivered everything i wanted so far.
the menu is very varied, the image quality is fantastic. i love this camera!
great as starting kit, but i would not shy away from some professional work.
easy to use
good quality pictures for the size
excellent auto focus
focusing system really fast
having used the original 7d for many years i have to say the mark ii is a massive step forward! brighter images, quicker focusing and dual card slots really help!
great camera

after 1 week still getting to know this camera, so difficult to pick one from so many good features, i've upgraded so it's a dramatic improvement in the quality of my shots! great video.
very good camera i all ready have 7d and 2 is a good addition
built to last
very quick to start, programable time lapse without a trigger, 65 point focus is brilliant. image stabilisation is also excellent.
10 pfs
great bit of kit
amazing camera with fantastic image quality that even though now superseded, will still remain one of the best cameras on the market for many years. very tough build quality.
resilliant. i managed to spill beer in it and it still works.
excellent image quality and build quality.
excellent camera overall.small and lightweight.
can't get better than this.
swivel screen is one of the reasons i went for this. great for awkward positions or holding the camera above your head in a crowd.
swing-out and swivel viewing screen
very impressive zoom , excellent quality pictures, handy swivel screen. easy to use.
ease of use - simila features to other canon products
easy to use, good range of shooting modes,although i use auto the most! and a flip out lcd screen
easy to use, and easy to upload onto pc.  has similar settings as all other canon cameras.  pictures always come out good and clear.. not like some other cameras where the auto focus makes the pics blurry.
it's compact so slips into your pocket but is better quality than many much elaborate models.  very responsive shutter - you don't have to wait several seconds between pressing the button and the shutter operating.
i purchased this camera to use with a person with learning difficulties and he has found it excellent and easy to use.he is now becoming a skilled photographer.
easy to yuse straight from the box
comfortable handling
neat little camera - easy to use
small,easy to handle
normal battery required
so easy to use my girlfriend whose a technophobe can use it
great size screen, compact design, manual mode allows better pictures at night. plus extra modes to pick from.
fantastic camera that even the young ones can use without any training and produce excellent results.
versetile small camera. good picture quality.
very compact.easy to get going.
a great camera for those who don't want to lug an slr around, but like to customise their shots. on the other hand, the automatic/ default modes also take a great picture
size, ease of use in 'simple mode', solid feel
all settable functions easy to set, overall excellent camera
face detection technology is impressive and it is easy to use overall.
easy to use
it takes good pictures.easy enough for my young teenage girl to take the shots she wants.there are a few options to improve photos,or change effects,if and when she's ready to find out.a quality camera.the video seems good too.
does what it says it does.
simplicity
one of the best little canons going
the large lcd screen which can be rotated to give alternative viewing positions. also can be rotated so that the lcd screen is covered and protected
this is the fourth or fifth canon camera i have used, and i really like the brand. this model gives really good value for money for a 7mp camera.
easy to grip and hold.
nice size, not too big.  easy to use, and flip out screen bonus.
good image quality for the price. good zoom range and good manual overide capability. convenient size and weight.
lcd viewfinder display that can be rotated to allow easy composition of high/low level shots. 4x optical zoom. accurate metering.
moveable lcd screen. movie mode. image quality. battery life.

idiot proof
reliable
stylish, compact and easy to use.
it is so easy to use. all its features can be used with one hand! i have several canon cameras, but this is the one i have with me all the time. i had the 5 million one before, now my son uses it.
and i think i got value for my money.
especially great was the auto face recognition which enables you to frame one or more faces in the centre of the picture, no more cutting off heads etc!
excellent camera with a wealth of features packed into a small easy to handle unit. for the price it is hard to beat especially the fact that it is powered by 2 aa batteries which makes it easy to use as they can be replaced without having to take a charger on holiday. would recommend it to anyone especially as a first time digital camera.
very easy to use, simple identified features
easy to use.good quality video. easy to download to pc.good one handed ergonomics, if you are right handed.
easy to understand and use
optical viewfinder. (essential)
manual control, good build quailty, price. - i bought the camera as a carry everywhere alternative to my dslr, i wanted manual controls for more creativity and something reasonably small. image quality is great upto about iso 400, after that noise becomes a bit of a problem, but pictures are still usable and you can always convert to black and white foa  grainy film effect!
nice size, easy to use, can use additional lenses
simplicity of use
the firework setting produces amazing photos and generally it is very easy to use and the photos are of excellent quality.
compact easy to handle
outstanding camera allround
although we found the features a bit complicated at first, they really complement the camera.
thay are all good points
ease of use
this camera was bought for my 13 year old daughter as the price was reasonable and i researched websites for feedback on the performance. it has so far lived up to the good reviews it had been given.
was my dad's first digital camera and having a cannon camera myself meant i already knew what allot of functions were.  because it is not too technical he did find easy to pick up.

ease of handling. good range of features.
good quality of photographs, although it took me some time to master the focussing - my fault, i suspect, and not a deficiency of the camera.
excellant value for money
great upgrade to my 450d, better built, better image quality and better lcd.
raw
automatic sensor cleaning
i love everything about this camera!
solid build.  easy to navigate menu system.  great quality photos.
having used the previous canon models 20d-40d it was easy to adapt to the 50d. the body build quality is the same high standard, there are just more features.
just about everything!
with well presented  instructions and the 50d is terriffic all round camara for any one.
fast robust and feature packed.  easy to use with powerful imaging ability a true photographers camera.
this is my first slr camera (previously digital compact) and have only had it 1 month. although a steep learning curve for me, i'm finding it relatively easy to find my way around and see the difference in quality when experimenting with different settings and options.  if i knew the camera better i would probably get even better pictures and so mark the image quality higher. the manual is easy to follow and very useful, especially when read in conjunction with books on techniques etc. it is easy to change the lens.  i love the span of zoom on the 2 lenses i chose and have already taken photos that far exceed the expectations i had.  i love it and am hooked - already making a list of extras i want to buy and buying books to learn more.
as owner of canon film slr and canon digital compact, the layout, controls and features were familiar and getting used to the camera was easy.
so easy to use and a good looking camera.
lots of features, easy to use, handy little camera to catch some good photos
the build quality and appearance is first class. as a newcomer to digital cameras i find it to be very user friendly. i intend to purchase this model of camera for my son as a xmas gift later in the year. overall i am delighted with my choice.
easy to use you cannot take a bad picture with this camera - wish i'd bought a case with it or maybe canon could sell a padded case along with this model.
point and shoot, with plenty of features for the expert. commonly available aa batteries mean you will never have the problem of the battery packs running out miles from a power point. canon quality shines through.
small, easy 12 megapixal
very easy to use. love the big screen.
photography, produces very good (but not excellent) pictures in various situations.
quality of camera
everything you could want from your digital slr.
very handy, easy to use - easy to understand its logic. it fits to my hand very well what is important if you use it for more than 5 minutes. many smart features. though it is not a 'professional' camera you can take decent photos - the main thing depends on you. you can have a full frame or something more expensive - if you don't have the eyes you will waste your time and money. so finally, i love it, i don't wanna change it.
i founld the camara has many good points and is user frendly
great to handle and easy to use. this is my first digital slr (updated from a cannon s70) and i have found it easy to understand and use giving me some excerlent pictures.
overall, this is a performance-based piece of engineering and when used with a quality canon ef lens the eos 1ds mkiii produces the best quality dslr images i've seen.
best ever
very good picture guality and various settings to choose from for different events such as a fireworks setting. a very good camera with sturdy contruction and a very good looking design.
fairly straight forward to use with a good range of features for the price.
i have only used it a little but so far have found it generally good although i am still learning
simple to use
purchased for my daughter for a level photography and she's delighted with it.
love it
