i bought it to cover both stills photography and videography. the pop-out screen is fine, but in strong light it is difficult to see the moving image, and you cannot use the viewfinder as an alternative. otherwise very good quality results.
body feels cheap and light plastic, although there is a coating that helps with grip, the camera feels light and fragile, probably is tougher than it feels. i wouldn't take this out without it being bagged up most of the time.
no wi-fi
all good.
not enough time in the day to use this superb camera
nothing to report yet ??
not discovered yet. may buy a stronger tele lena for outdoor activities.
only annoying thing when working in theatres under difficult lighting conditions is the limited exposure lock feature.  the * button is ok but fiddly and it should be possible to lock it with the shutter half pressed in all modes, not just 'evaluative' metering.
it came without serial numbers which is very strange
it shoots for around 4 hours non-stop, which is actually really good in comparison but something to keep in mind. and also, it has a 'self-close' feature when its not being used for a bit, which does get quite irritating, and right now there doesn't seem to be an easy way of removing that
the camera is a gray import and
it's a shame i didn't get a free telescopic lens ;)
kit lens is but don't expect amazing eye popping pictures...obviously
it feels light and very plastic. this makes me feel a little apprehensive when holding it. i'd prefer a more solid feel. maybe an aluminium body or something more substantial. a minor detail. i'm sure i'll get used to it.
no built in wi-fi but that's not a major problem for me.
even though a beginners camera you need time to get around features though these are a plus point too
no wifi
haven't found any yet !
no bad points.
i now need more lenses...
also a dvd of a step by step guide would have also been good
construction is rather plastic
to assist the auto-focus in low-light, the flash fires a strobe flash burst which gets annoying quickly.
it feels cheep and the 18-55 lens feels so plastic, got the sigma 70-300 lens and it struggles all the time to find focus if you can afford it go for the canon.
no wi-fi, but not really that important!
on automatic setting, focus is always on what is central in the viewer. if object/face is slightly off central it can be blurred. use manual focus instead.
the speed and accuracy of the autofocus. it takes longer than desirable to focus and the result is fuzzy shots.
liveview could be quicker and video focusing a little slow to react. minor niggles.
no.
not a particularly robust camera which unfortunately means that the camera will not last too long if used regularly before lense focusing and recycle time start becoming variable
don't waste your money
no
had a slightly cheap- plasticky feel to the body
not used it yet so cannot say
kit lense! only good for portraits
instruction booklet is daunting. i am sure that war and peace is shorter.
waiting for the camera in anticipation!
nothing to clean it with
doesn't fly
how long it took to come, but it got here eventually and well packeged
not being able to see screen very well in sunlight whilst in movie mode
not really any
nothing bad about it really.
timer on remote sensor
as the camera has lots of features and modes (which is good) it can be confusing to access them as some can only be accessed via th 'love' mode whilst others are via the manual buttons. just something to get used to!
no bad points for the time being. could be more competitively priced to suite similar nikons.
in one word no
there are no bad points at all
not weather proof. but both to be expected.
it's not cheap
it's about time cameras came with a protective uv filter for the lens, and a sheet of film to protect the lcd screen, as standard. these are essential extras.
0
should come with a case
not so far.
nothing products are great and i have shot lots of photos with different canon cameras since about 1980.
zooming in video mode is difficult to be smooth, but practice helps :-)
so far nothing wrong that i can mention
can't think of any
lots of things on the menu and whilst some people may like the option of taking pics in various colours, themes, etc i think most will post process so could slim down menu a little but that's maybe just me.
nothing
you won't find any
i think the only improvment i can think of is vetter weather sealing. it's not much but there really isn't much wrong with this camera.
all good
no
it can feel a little heavier in comparison to other dslr cameras
huge instruction manual to get in to your head. that said there is so much to learn it needs a big manual.
it will take a lot of reading of the manual and practice with the camera before i am able to use the camera to its full potential
slightly over priced, but then again it is a canon. needs a uv filter to protect the optics.
still feel video mode despite using a fast sdhc card a bit jerky frame rate. trying different settings so hopefully get it right. maybe best not to pan too much
battery won't last long if you use it for a lot of video recording.
i o not see any.
am exploring buying new software.
heavy
battery is low live
no bad points
expensive
yet to come across any
a bit plastic-y at first feel
it would be great if the build quality made the camera feel somewhat more robust.
leaving smudges on the screen display when using the viewfinder.
plastic body can be a bit light on better lenses.
nothing as of yet
non
i am probably biased but i cannot fault or find any bad points.
expensive
haven't found anything yet.
i can't get the wifi to connect directly to my computer to upload images.
awkward on/off switch
release a mirrorless dslt.
nothing bad about the camera.
canon has limited the usability of wifi - cannot use to connect  to computer.
difficult to connect to ipad
it isn't weatherproofed so watch out.
nothing at the moment.
little plastic feel in build quality
gps requires more...
hdr . .  i can't see the difference and i can't find any way of adjusting it to make the effect more noticeable.  :(
nothing i can think of.
nothing so far.
nothing
no bad points to mention so far
batteries  not the same as the 60d(had 7 with battery grip) so have to get a new spare battery
nothing
i like everything
so please, register the things, when you send!
i had to return the camera as the mini usb port did not work meaning it would not tether with my laptop if i was not in a wi-fi area. i have requested a replacement.
you can't use a sigma or tamaron lens with this camera. hope you market leaders will start talking?
weight. would like it a bit lighter.
strap is thin
*you aren't going to get dslr style shallow depth of field with this size of sensor. if you need this then you will have to get a bigger camera (dslr or mirrorless csc). i won't be selling my sony a6000, but the canon powershot s120 fits the bill when carrying a bigger camera is not practical.
like most cameras at this price there is still no viewfinder!  however, you can adjust the brightness of  the rear screen so it is  brighter than before - although that uses more battery.
haven't really been using the camera long enough to find too many bad points...auto flash with underwater setting needs to be reselected when the camera is switched on. maybe i can overcome this using custom ...will need to experiment.
manual flash ejection
no cable supplied for direct download to pc
not much of an upgrade over the s110.
having to use canon image gateway to transfer images by wifi - not a versatile interface e.g. can't download multiple images yoru device (have to download each one individually from the website or app), rrp expensive
touch screen can get in the way, just takes a bit of getting used to!
the camera was faulty on arrival and the customer service has been very bad.
lack of optical viewfinder, cannot charge battery via usb
mediocre image quality, but what do you expect in such small camera
would like a basic user guide and also a lead to connect to my pc
very few
user interface could be easier for old people
it's a slightly old design now but at a great price and is still a great camera.
image quality, features
needed a uk plug on the charger
takes a while to navigate around all the different features
haven't found any bad points
flash
the ring around the lense i was hoping was a manual focus pull ring, and its not. but this isnt a big issue for me.
not easy to hook up with wifi or my my mac computer
dynamic range too limited
quite a small battery capacity. narrower aperture adusting range when you zoom towards tele.
manual is only a formal description, does not tell you how to use the camera.
off/on switch a little fiddly.
some features are difficult to access / not self explanatory. the lack of a printed manual makes this worse. you have to download the manual and all software.
small (obviously!)  so just holding it takes some getting used to, compared to an slr - perhaps a slightly larger grip could be built in? -  but the features and photo quality make it a great piece of kit.
battery life is rubbish. doesn't come with a sd card. you can't charge the battery via a usb cable in the camera.
guarantee for 2 years should be included as standard.
a bit pricey not used any functions to rate them
it's a shame that canon could not have included a lens hood with the lens that i bought. for the amount that the lens alone cost, a lens hood would not have broken their bank i'm sure.
i would rather have wifi ( so i can remote it from a phone/laptop) than gps ( i usually know where i am)  and it really needs moveable screen ( such as on the 70d)
i keep pressing the wrong buttons to zoom in during playback.  old habits die hard.
the camera was a christmas present and i have not found anything that i would complain about.
no wifi

af system does take a lot of practise to get the perfect shot in aspects such as birds in flight
no wifi, who wants gps?

only thing its a little heavy but that was expected and is so solidly built
cost of battery grip.
really slow delery, took a hell of a long time to turn up but for the money you save...well.. its worth waiting for
battery life
the price
no wifi
not yet; i am still exploring all its capabilities.
don't have any bad points.
not really a bad point but just be aware this is not a simple camera to operate and it will take some time to get to know all the functions and how to use them.
maybe two many features some i will never use but great piece of kit.
takes some setting up, still no wifi feature.
nothing
nothing bad so far in the first month of use other than a tiny amount of digital noise at the high end of the iso range, but this is to be expected with any camera and is easily overcome using software.
there are so many features on this camera for me it is going to be quite a learning curve
power consumption, bad screen.
i would like to have 10 more megapixels. :)
the 7d mk ii has a lot more buttons than my previous 650d, so it's going to take a little while to learn the functionality and find out what this camera can do.
focussing system - though no doubt excellent - takes some getting used to. so many options, and less intuitive than i'd like.
no
image quality only sightly better than the 7d from iso 400 to 800. noise becomes an issue for me above iso 800.heavy on batteries, so carry a couple of spares and having to use the main dial to magnify images when viewing on camera. i much prefer pressing the button on the 7d.
it does'nt have wifi.
body and lenses checked for calibration by cannon, no fault found.
can be quite complex to set up the focussing to achieve exactly what you want.
different way of reviewing pictures, unlike all the other canon cameras i've used
not yet
nothing
disappointing that some advanced features that are on other recent releases were not included. no articulated screen.
my d7 battery pack won't fit the d7 mark 2. will use a third party
there is a steep learning curve - it is a complicated camera.
heavy. but little else to fault.
expensive
heavy but then it is well made
meets my expectations.
the only down side for me at the moment was the price.  whilst this will come down in the months to come, i still feel that an upgrade from the 7d was well worthwhile
high price
not found
no wifi
battery life is a small step backward, overall image quality is significantly improved over the 7d but still inferior to full frame cameras. not quite as much extra reach with long lenses as 1.6 crop factor would suggest and no advantage over ff in this respect above 1600iso.
as you'll see from the spec, it comes with quite a few separate accessories (lens caps and things), so i would strongly recommend buying yourself a camera bag to keep everything together.
battery life is a little limited but the acquisition of a second battery has solved that problem.
does not come with the flash unit
although the touch screen is great, i would swap it for a view finder for in bright light
no in camera raw development
should be sold with lens adapter included as there are currently only 3 lens available.
no viewfinder (because its mirror less, the screen is impossible to see in the sun), adapter needed (at a hefty \xa3100) to attach standard canon lenses. no tethered shooting!? this one actually almost take it back. all other eos cameras can, why can't this one?
still looking for some!
no viewfinder.
a optical view finder sometimes can be useful especially in bright sunlight.
it's fairly heavy
no ability to use wireless or usb remote (ir only via front facing sensor which is restrictive for 360 degree panorama boom work using 8mm fisheye).  maybe this can be fixed in the firmware?
not really.
the technical jargon for the various uses is sometimes difficult to understand but on the whole a great camera.
this is a great camera, the only bad point is that focusing can be a bit slow especially in low light.
would have liked to have a manual included.
downloading videos is not easy as the canon site does not reconize the camera and no lead is supplied with it
min aperture f/8.
no guarantee documents (or any others) with the camera
view finder near useless. lens casts a shadow. a bit too heavy.
fix monitor
manual is far too long. it needs condensing
no manual came with it
possibly a bit expensive.
the only minor point is if you have large hands the camera is a tad small, but add on the thumb clip that is available it makes it easier to handle
the lens could be slightly sharper and a 'real view' through the viewfinder
enormous amount in the on line manuals which can be a little overwhelming.
possibly the lack of a tilting lcd screen though this hasn't caused me any isseues as yet.
aperture correction and the program selector button on the too of the camera turn too easily.  always have to check them when i take camera out of the case
wind noise on video mic.
the exposure compensation dial is to easy to knock, so you need to check it.
a little bulky compared to many others on the market but my favorite
menu structure takes some time to understand.
i regret the lack of tilt/swivel screen which, as a pensioner, i would have liked for macro nature pics.
write speed can be slow on bigger memory cards
no tilt screen, would like to see made more compact, ambitious i know
no case with it.
connectivity with smart phone seems not easy would be useful to control camera from smart phone
the position of the flash is a bit awkward as i have nowhere to put my left hand fingers when taking a shot.  also my left thumb tends to cover the screen but i have purchased protective covers which solved that problem.
could be a size of camera to keept in a hand, or that maybe me, not find yet.
strap is fiddly to fit
a bit heavy to carry and clumsy to handle
when i pull it out of case quickly to take e.g. wildlife the settings can slip around unnoticed e.g. off auto to something else spoiling the image.
not possible to upload to dropbox using wifi
haven't found any so far.
very difficult to attach the strap
high level of background noise is audible on video playbacks
no paper or disc instructons
no hand book
camera now uses more plastic in construction compared to g10 so hope it is as solid as older model was. on the positive side it is lighter. one big thing i miss is the hinged lcd screen. that was useful for holding camera and taking shots at an angle.
200+ pages of the manual to read or download took ages and was laborious.
side panel cover very flimsy
some controls close so together that it's easy to change something by accident - at first.
shame they don't do the reversible screen last seen on the g12.
have not come across any at this stage
macro disappointing , but you can attache a close up lense via an optional filter adapter which gives acceptional results.
no fold out lcd, (but it did cost me \xa3120 to get that fixed on my g12) so that won't be breaking on a 16, loss of asa (iso) speed dial, now has a pop up flash! (that will break instead of the lcd!) build does not seem as study as the g12
viewfinder coverage a little poor.
focusing points to every other objects than humans
be nice if the eye level viewfinder could provide more than the 80 per cent of the actual scene under view
haveing to get instructions from internet
nothing
irritating that i had to buy a manual, as it cam with no written operating instructions at all
would have appreciated location co-ordinates.
fitting the strap!!
the wifi is basic, you can view and transfer photo's but you can't control the camera remotely
no electronic viewfinder
you need to buy a book on the features as there is little information provided to get the best out of the camera.
not a bad point really but getting to grips with all it's features takes time!
no
a bit fiddly changing options
doesn't come with a case, which is a bit silly for a small camera like this.
it has so many features, you need to buy a manual to teach you where to find them and how they all work.
i miss the dedicated iso-setting wheel of g10. would be nice to be able to delete pics from camera via connection with computer. (mac) maybe a little pricey at list price.
no documentation.
not yet
i still miss the fold out lcd screen on g12
lack of instruction manual
lack of an articulated viewfinder screen which canon featured on earlier models
the wifi doesn't allow remote view when shooting
battery could last a little longer.  quite a complex camera
the dial has auto next to video and it is easy to move it to video without realising.
no flip out screen
not yet!
a user guide would be helpful
no
no manual or quick guide just a 221 page manual to download -in very small print!
it's quite a weighty bit of kit.
really can't think of any.
exposure information in the viewfinder would be a bonus.
i was a little concerned that the packaging suggested it was for the japanese market only!
nothing at the moment.
non found yet
could be a bit bigger
not found any yet!
just a pity it hasn't got a touch screen
when using a filter extension you can see it through the viewfinder. locating a suitable case to accommodate the camera plus the extension was  a bit of a search.
absence of hardcopy user manual.
product came without operating software or paper booklet
lcd screen not articulated
lack of a moveable screen.
more optical zoom would be nice, wifi awkward to set up but works well o centre it is.
no remote via smart phone, fixed lcd screen
no swivel on the screen
not found any yet
worst eyelevel viewfinder in the world, this really needs major design alterations. interchangeable lens would have been a nice extra feature and resolution could be a little higher say 18 megapixels.
.
no manual included and online copy over 200 pages.
i feel its not as well built as the g10. pop up flash is annoying.
no flip out screen (as on previous g series cameras)
disc supplied was all in japanese
wifi seems exceptionally complicated to set up
price could be my only complaint
expensive (but its worth it)
price
nothing, !!
it's not bad to say it's heavy but the weight may be an issue for some people.
heavy!
heavy
haven't found any negatives yet!
it is better than the 5d mk iii, but it's quite a big jump in price as well.
are you serious????????
no head phone jack
nothing
why put high def video on what is designed to be a still camera.  i feel it would have been better to just issue the 1dc as a video equipped camera and kept the 1dx as a still camera.
no..
being honest it's not a bad point really! it is heavy! but i like that.
sync speed of 250/1
no inbuilt wifi , but can use eye-fi card
some of the menus are a little confusing.
no wi-fi or gps. if you are used to taking photos on an iphone, this will take getting used to.
not a genuine canon product
plain black grips, coloured grips would be really cool.
it has a very cheap feeling textured plastic body that doesn't feel nice to hold. touch screen feels a bit flimsy.
with the weight of the lens i bought with it, the strap is a bit rough on the neck when carrying it.
battery compartment a bit tricky to open.
the only thing i could criticise is the camera body is a bit plastic looking but that would be it.
no
not really

plastic body.
no information about how to reclaim the \xa350 cash back from canon!
only had it for a week so bit soon to tell.
feels a bit plasticy
the only winge is that the on/off button is to close to the shutter button so without care you can turn the camara off instead of taking a photo
although the on/off, shutter and video buttons are well positioned and easy to use the others are a little fiddly.
no real bad points but you need lights so i'm going to buy some for my next trip just to lighten every thing up and show more colour but you can take really great pictures with out lights
item delevered was japanese market only, so all setting were in japanese. eventually found where to set language to english (second to last setting on 'tools icon'). bingo no squigly lines just english, chuffed to bits.
delay between shots. need for focus before making shot (fish don't pose ). first battery charge ran out very quickly - second charge produced much longer life.
nothing as yet.
no
narrow aperture lens
nothing bad at all
battery charger is a us plug, so you need an adaptor for the uk.
battery life doesn't last that long before needing to recharge.
have to be careful with the lens
sadly no case
too many of the excellent settings are buried in difficult to reach sub-menus. (those awkward thumb buttons again)
have not found any yet.
not as many features such as the zoom range as others but there again you can't have a waterproof camera and a big zoom range.

it's quite pricey, and about worth it but if the cost is for the video features, it would have been a better camera if cheaper and just for stills. the wrist strap could do with a  'running' loop so you can tighten it around the wrist. it's so loose that it will easily slip off over your hand.
so far as i can see, there is no time delay option which i am disappointed by.
low sound on the video, no case with the camera,
not easy to master. sometime the complicated menu make reaction too slow to fast moving scene.
delicate, no touch screen and good price is in sky.............
the camera doesn't easily sit on it's base safely, it tends to roll over!
that is the only niggle i've had with it in two holidays and several nights out...
sometimes pictures are not focused properly.
no special bad points at the moment.
very difficult to affix the strap to the camers.
camera didn't come with a case so i purcahased this separately.
camera does not come with memory card
when shooting a video aand you zoom in. the lens is quite hard to zoom in and if you dont have a tripod you'll probably loose the stability  and stillness of the camera and ruin the video because your gonna shake a little but if you have image stabilization on it will help a lot in shooting a video without a tripod.
with the lens i chose it was a little heavier than i thought it would be all together but i will adapt to it in time.
have to remember to switch off the camera each time or the battery runs out and has done to me too many times.. previous cameras had auto off.
bigger than compact cameras.

slow focus on video. zooming while videoing is not smooth and loses focus.
bought the camera instead of some wallpaper and paint to decorate the house.....not gone down well
filter attachment ring is larger than that on the 450 so existing filters don't fit the supplied lens
the only negative is that this is a camera for advanced photography. if you're a novice, this is not the camera for you. on the other hand, if you know your iso, fstops, and shutter speed, this is an amazing camera for the price!
at first, the number of physical controls and the features behind them  proved a bit perplexing. shooting on manual at night was not self-evident on the first go, mostly in terms of focusing. the somewhat unmeshed dichotomy of conventional viewing and live viewing as well as the rather short battery life bring down the rating from 9 to 8.
plastic finish feels /looks cheap but works to provide a good surface to grip on
* having to ensure you set the right volume before recording video. can't change this during recording
no real complaints, just a bit heavier than my former camera, but that is to be expected, i purchased with the 18-135 mm kit lens, which is obviously also heavier than the 18-55, however the additional focal length is of major benefit with my animal and bird photos.
not really a 'bad point' but sometimes the autofucus wont focus on the object you are taking a photo off
plastic body, manual can be better .
nothing yet that i have found
not at the mo.
wifi difficult to setup.
if you don't mind waiting and want to save pots of money, buy from this site. they do tell you when it's going to arrive as well.
no headphone socket
no bad points
it is unable to stream live video over wifi. as in video mode the wifi is switched off.

using flash to trigger other light systems hard to setup
can't fault the camera but it is a little expensive, but there again you get what you pay for.
it's been a week and i'm still struggling with those menus to get the best out of it, but it's a matter of time...
am still experimenting the new features but so far nothing negative
focus hunting with ef 100-300mm zoom is a little irksome, and i haven't yet found how to stop it
haven't found any yet....
waiting to long! for the product!
could be a little less heavy
wifi function is very limited and slow, also very slow in live view mode shooting
i have to practice more to find out in detail the prons and cons
it's quite heavy with the lens on.
heavier than the 1000d but this only shows me how well built it is.
non magnesium body but i'm sure this is robust enough ...
a little larger and heavier than my previous canon 650 - but still a great package and a huge improvement in the technology.
have found nothing negative about the camera so far although i have yet to print from the sdhc memory card.
takes some time to learn the more remote features, but we'll worth the effort - everything you may want is there.
not found any yet
dunno of any yet
can be a bit tricky to hold without the neck strap attatched.
there is nothing that i don't like. i do miss the versatility of the variable-angle viewing screen of the 600d, but there had to be compromises to achieve the weight-saving in the 100d, which is a very minor niggle and is the obvious way to achieve the lightness.
my little finger hangs off the bottom of the grip. at first i wasn't happy about this as the camera felt a bit insecure in my hand. but after using it a few times you get the feel for it.
okay i can print it out, and i suppose i will, but i would happily pay for a decent manual or book!
grey import, no serial number to register with canon for warranty
no articulated screen but would have been difficult to fit one on a camera of this size, but certainly not a deal breaker when considering purchase of this camera.
the lens focussing motor whirls when taking videos, i can hear it on the results.  it's not good at all.
it could do with a few more settings for stuff like sunrise/sunset and nature to give bright colours.
battery life
no  paper instruction manuel
no memory card included so unless you spot this you have a camera but cannot play with it straight away.
expensive, but this was the best price/package i found
nothing
alost complete lack of hard-copy manuals, most on cd/dvd
small point, but the camera didn't come with a bog standard memory card. luckily, i'd bought a new card at the same time but would have been disappointed if camera had arrived and had been unable to fully utilise due to this.
not come across any bad points so far.
haven't found a bad point yet
this camera doesn't come with an sd card. we had to buy one separately. bit annoying as would have expected this to be included.
nearly fell out of my hand as it's quite a small camera so i bought a battery grip to make it easier to handle.
no flip out screen and no wifi but this would affect the size of the camera
i haven't found any.
the 18mm - 55mm lens supplied with body is limiting, suggest getting 55mm - 250mm lens at same time.
less buttons to directly access exposure options on the rear of the camera but they are easily selected through the excellent touch screen.
video guzzles batteries -  old camera battery lasted  months.  even with little video,  you'll need 2  batteries on the go for heavy use.
in low light it can struggle to get any sort of depth of field but this a very minor point on an otherwise goid body and lens combination.
i did not find bad points.
very plastick feel
pics not as sharp as i would like
i was used to the gps tags, taking pictures from my phone, but there is no such thing on the camera. it just means i need to document my pictures manually when i import them into my picture library.  there is an optional gps device, but it's almost half the price of the camera body, and take as much space as an external flash light. not such a big deal, but it would have been nice to have an integrated one.
it's very diffcult to use for me
no wifi/bluetooth, but its not expensive so cant complain.
no
takes time to get a really good picture.
after only a few weeks, i realise that ineed to buy a zoom lens for it.
needs to be weather proofed
only one colour black
cheap built

the camera is fine , dealing with se was horrendous , they lied , i needed camera for best friends wedding , they promised me it within 2 days , i got it 20 days later. i am in process of writing to all camera clubs , and papers to make everyone aware to keep clear. also when you do email them , they ignore it and send you a mail back trying to get me to buy other products. disgraceful way to treat someone!
nothing bad really, this is not bad but a mic external plug in port is not too much of a strech i think.
auto eos connection to the computer is not positive and importing pictures is fiddly.
heavy to carry around
shutter speed not as fast as i personally would like
not aware of any yet
it doesn't have a touch screen or wifi service.
no
can't see any
no rotating screen (not that suprising at this price point)
it's right handed
no pad points...
should come with a memory card, and carry case. but a great camera.
it feels a bit plasticky, but having said that it's very light (unlike my ancient eos10 which is like a house brick)
settings navigation is a bit tricky without a touchscreen, but once you learn knack it's quick.
i think it is ridicules the camera does not come with an sd card, as it will not work without one !
taking a while to get used to the many features and controls after years of using nikon cameras.
nothing
there is no tilty flippy screen apart from that an excellent camera.
i've had to purchase a book on the camera because the manual is woeful.
a little on the heavy side
can't find a thing wrong with it!
nothing to dislike
nothing.
n.a
nothing.
nothing about the product just took a while to get to me and communications from the supplier were not good.
megapixels could be better.
not that much of an improvement on features i.e. the preset picture modes, than the previous eos 1000d i have.
the manual was huge and required a computer to view. would have liked a condensed quick start hard copy of the manual i could read to begin with whilst getting used to the camera. a way to register the product to your name that would benefit you if the camera was ever stolen would be a nice feature too.
or reference.
quite heavy to carry round but that is expected of a camera like this.
not a bad point at all.
the instruction manual and cd were in spanish had to contact canon, simply electronics did not to know
feels cheep.the plastic body feels cheap and the lense ate mentioned to be both auto focus and manual as these switches are on the telephoto lenze but this function does not work on the model. it only works with manual. .no auto focus on this model which with the cheap plastic body doesn't make this a good starter to use the dslr
nikon has slightly better image due to mp
the whole body is made out of plastic, so i'm scared it's going to start falling apart but only time will tell. sometimes the light sensor is not working so well, sometimes it either over or underexposes shots.
iv'e just upgraded from a bridge camera to a dslr so im in the process of learning about how to use it at the moment and using the guide book. this isnt a criticism just letting people know i havn't used all the options open to me with this camera yet.
viewfinder a little smaller than i would of liked
not found any yet so maybe there aren't any .
not found them yet
the back visualiser could be a little clearer.
no negatives.
a little heavy
i did not buy one earlier
its disappointing that no one these days supply a user manual but i think that's the way it is now.
focusing at distance of small objects on auto focus, til you get used to it.
if you have a 1100d and want to up grade this is not the obvious option.
i have a previous version so know enough about the camera
no nothing
n/a
early days but no problems so far.
could do with a better sd card and a second battery
to be honest i can't really think of any thing i don't like about this camera the battery life is much better than i thought it would be. i looked at other cameras before buying the 1200d and can honestly say i made the right choice.
hard to fault but there is no depth of field preview button on this model ( most people probably don't event think of this, i imagine )
nothing
this camera is an upgrade for me. previously owned an eos 5 and what a difference! the images are so bright, full of life and sharp. it took my rather longer to move away from the auto setting because it was so good though, having now done so, the on screen information is superb. brilliant camera!
no bad points so far
no intervalmeter and wish magic lantern was released for it.
manual not very comprehensive, had to check online for full details of certain options.
no headphone socket
haven't found anything.
to make most of this one needs to spend some time appreciating all of the many things this camera can do. it can be used as point to shoot but that would be misusing this brilliant camera.  so it will take time and effort to make the most of this.  and i am trying to do that.
not found any
a clearer instruction booklet and digital guide.
not found any yet still learning from it
nothing.
changing the camera settings ( setting wheel) is fiddly.
i have not learned about any yet.
the multifunction controller on the back is too small.
only one c-option to program.
should have the gps function.
very slow focus in live view. video of moving subjects leads to poor focus, better to keep it manual.
not found any
only annoying drawback is with the remote viewing of images, at 20mb per image it can take a good few seconds to render picture detail on a wi-fi connection to a pad or phone - unsure as to what connection speed the camera can operate at.
video screen in the bright light. back off screen will scratch easy. battery life not great just ok, keep a couple spear.
hdr / creative functions available on jpg only
nothing  much discovered yet, except that no geopsitioning locational tagging to photos is a disappointment as more basic cannon cameras include it as does the iphone
wifi setup, more difficult than you would expect.
not sure how the plastic body will endure compared to the metallic previous models - guess i will find out first time i drop it!
have not found any yet. very excited to take to zambia later this week.
so far no bad points
bit plastic
it is early days yet, nothing comes to mind.
one or two buttons could be easier to use.
and the fully automatic mode is stupid - instead of focusing on the item in the centre it focuses on all the outer points hence the main item at the centre item is out of focus, and when focusing on the scene a mile away the flash pops up and fires(?) you cannot force it or set it to focus on the item in the centre in automatic mode if the sensor locks on sufficient external points. i manually focus the camera most of the time because i cannot trust it.
swing out screen slightly less convenient than direct view.  minor point that functions are in different places from the 450d
for stills, i would save a bit more and get the 7d or d610 full frame for superior image quality
the frame counter only goes up to 999.
i haven't tried the wi-fi yet as i can't yet find the app i need on apple. working on that one
the one thing i didn't like, you can't change the colour of the menu screen! :) everything else is just amazing.
nothing he can think of!
not yet!
it is fairly heavy, but in some cases this can be good.
it's early days so finding things i don't like are mostly small niggles, like the buttons and the on/off switch all of which are not as slick as on the nikon d7100. so i gave it 9/10 because i consider the build quality to be not as good as my nikon d7100, yes i have nikon and canon so i can give an unbiased opinion.
the top lcd panel functions are to close together and hard to see
button in the middle of the quick control dial is not straight.
a bit heavy and still expensive
no bad points
does not have video format 1920 x 1080 50i or 50p.
the selector wheel isn't that obvious when pressing it, sometimes it leaves you wondering if you have pressed it or not! it is responsive but just not always obvious if it had been pressed fully
go for the version with the lens as my old lens has old motor technology which is quite loud for hd filming.
why didn't i buy one before?
pictures come little out of focus and also sharpness compare to nikon cams, are not in par with
i have not found anything not to like yet
ease of use of lcd screen while taking photos
not yet
build quality does not seem as good as my canon 50d.
2. still 1 card slot
the only minus is the fact that it is a lot heavier than my 600d but i expect i will get used to that.
if this is your first dslr it could be a very daunting camera to try and get to grips with
could have better build quality, not as solid as canon eos 40d that it replaced.
the wheel dial a bit too small.
so hard to get used to, i have had it 3 weeks and still getting used to it .. i have taken the easy way out and using the touch screen !
missing gps
no distracting features to date
its a good crop camera and the best crop camera for video that canon are currently doing
construction seems to play machine, plastic and rubber in the hands. who comes from a 7d, 5d, 6d etc. will not like.
sometimes a little complex with some manual over-rides needed to give some better options.  not had this long enough to fully test but this is only a minor negative
being able to save more custom setups would be an advantage.
feels a little plasticy
still searching for one!
perhaps a tad heavy
not that i know of.
cost. struggled to justify the cost initially but it beats the competition by some margin.
nothing
had to get replacement due to this and scratches in viewfinder
...
have not came across any
it has many new features not in 60d
not so much bad but why only one card slot ?
select wheel too small (vs 7d)
the video/camera stills selector can be accidentally switched from stills to video.  this happened on my first field trip when attaching a telephoto lens.
not found any yet
top screen too small and fingers get in the way.
video panel not fully rotating 360 degrees
non
the on off switch is in diff place that's about it really f\xe0b camera all my old lenses fit too which the 650d didn't
it's a little pricey, but no doubt the price will come down once it's been out for a while
costly but was worth it!!!
it soon became apparent that to own a good set up = decent fast memory cards (x2) a few l lens; extender, flash, remote release, prime lens and case the initial purchase spend could easily triple.......and all with only 1 years warranty. at this level for amatuer use surely 3 years should be a part of any deal - not silly priced warranty extensions - come on canon your product looks and feels great where the confidence in your product
i also think it's a little mean that canon don't include a screen protector - for the sake of a few pounds, it really would make a lot of difference and stop the inconvenience of having to buy one separately for additional cost.
intricate interface with a lot of functionality that needs some research to get it right and working well. manual not exactly a easy read, so an outside guide is worth investing in. not much else really. a damned good camera that's worth the money [every hard earned penny]
you'll have to have insurance
price
ive yet to find some...
need to upgrade lightroom (to lightroom 4) or use adobe dng converter to download files
quite heavy and a bit pricey but worth it.
very few. it's just a shame that my old mk2's grip is useless as that was \xa3250 wasted but the new one is a better design. there are now so many buttons its getting like a nikon..... finally, i don't find the menus quite as intuitive....yet. there are so many options and accessing them doesn't seem as quick and easy as a result though you can pic a few of your favourites and create your own quick menu, the number is too limited. (about 6 i think)
price.  you get what you pay for with canon though.
not really bad but during winter with gloves i find myself to remove the gloves in order to use some smaller types of the buttons on the camera - but without gloves no problem at all!
cant think of any.
very annoying that the editing infrastructure isn't in place..3k on a camera, yet no software is ready for raw editing!?! whats that all about - seriously bad planning..no excuse!
doesn't come with a canon uk charger.  rather a us 2 pin charger and a clumsy adaptor.  on the plus side good for travelling but annoying when in the uk.  they should have explained this at the time of ordering.
cost
price compared to previous model but superior in image quality and features
2nd card slot should be high speed so that you can shoot to both at the same time with no adverse impact on burst rate
it is expensive.  learning curve is extremely steep.
no. great value
nothing up to now
should include wi fi and gps, as mk6 does, at this price.
not found any
a little on the expensive side. it takes some time and effort to learn all the features but that is also the fun part of it.
camera can get heavy after carrying around for a day.
still a bit costly, but you get what you pay for!
need a bigger safe
price
expensive
picture quality is definitely better than 550d but not substantially for the money - but it is early days in my use of the camera
as yet i haven't found any
can take a bit of finding your way around all the features as there are so many. hence the 9 out of 10 for ease of use.
really don't like the fact that you cannot have a red focus point on servo mode.  it's black, which often doesn't show up.  this is a retrograde step from the 5dii as the focus point is almost impossible to see if there's any detail in the shot.  you have to kind of remember where it is.  apparently due to the way the sensor is designed there is no fix.
i didnt like the fact they had moved the way the on off switch works
with very heavy use these cameras sometimes develop a moving part fault but canon servicing have always been able to make the necessary repair.
complex focusing method
they have changed where something's are in the menu display early days of using it so need to get my head around it
must know what you are doing to get the best from it.  a steep learning curve to master all of its capabilities.
suspicion the images are over exposed slightly compared with a leica m9. i suspect wifi connections to download images will come in the next model.
vs. the 6d, which is \xa31000 cheaper, there's not that much difference.
rather difficult to manage the different menus. espensive.
too many choices on the system, the menu names are not self explanatory.
no bad points. it just takes a while to get to know the camera when venturing from full auto mode
so many new features on the camera i have had to buy a second instruction book but i still love the camera. this is not really a bad thing you gust have to take your time to get your head around it all.
the camera is on the expensive side but the top notch camera bodies are very expensive unfortunately.
doesn't shoot 50fps at 1080p
expensive.
nothing
takes a while to familiarise with controls.  a lot different to 5dii.

it is very expensive !!!!

the only thing i could say is bad is the lack of a joystick oh and the dof button is very small and hidden
a swivle screen would be nice
i use the centre point and re-compose so have no interest in complex af systems, but the af is pretty rudimentary.
wifi drains battery if left on.
nothing really.
don't expect to get perfect results straight away you have to practice then just watch out for the excellent pictures
one cross type focus point. you need more clicks to obtain a decent photo during a fast action. however it still does a great job.
not have fold out screen.
bit complex to work out in some areas, but once you use the manual/google it then everything is easy!
nothing really ......except memory card
sorry - can't think of any. only delighted so far.
* this is not a bad point but just a remark; file size when shooting in raw version (23.5 mb per file).
cant think of any
not found any
no bad points
takes time to learn those so that the use becomes fluent
battery charger is not straight forward
could be better with an articulated screen.
the only problem i have found is battery life when the gps is on. batteries only last a couple of hours even if the camera is switched off. if the gps is switched of it comparable to the 60d.
life of obturacion 100000 shots
would be improved with a movable screen
not really a bad point, but no pop up flash. i can be handy at times.
can't think of any just yet.
can't think off
not found any yet.
gps drains battery, stupid firmware is not turning it off when camera is off, you have to do it manually.
no built in flash - minor disadvantage; only one sd card slot.
the main problem with the camera is that the gps has a real drain on the battery, even when the camera is switched off, and you have to dig deep into the menu options to turn gps on and off.
only one card slot
some features difficult to find from menus
only good value if you have the right lenses not suitable for efs lenses.
no flash
way too many features, most of which no one ever uses. god  help anyone without slr experience trying to understand instructions, especially on disc !!!
lack of pop up flash.
it did not work out of the box.
still quite big and heavy
there is almost too much on this camera to be able to learn it all.
its not for our zone and raw files cannot be processed
as per usual moan camera good lens good but no lens hood come on canon look after your troops
lack of focus points
there are times when a built in flash is handy - shame it doesn't have one
only one really usable focus point in the middle not good for fast action photography.
outdated autofucus capabilities compared to some of their other cameras
body size is a bit small for my hands so had to get a battery grip too - now feels much better. ..
it would have been fine to have had the buttons the same as the other canon cameras.
i need touchscreen and other features like in my previous 70d. but it is still worth it to get the excellent image quality.
unable to down load photographs to computer
could do with built-in flash, annoying having to keep fitting one to the hot shoe.
too few physical buttons, i am still unable to determine some settings, guess i need to read manual more.
more af points would be good!
absence of pc sync port, but this is easily fixed with an adaptor for the hot shoe
programmes unnecessary. no touch screen .
buttons a little difficult in low light conditions.
focus points are only 11
my cf-s lenses don't fit so i have to purchase new.
doesn\x92t feel as smooth and professional as the pro range 5d series, but it is cheaper and not a 5d!
nothing!
nothing
menu a bit confusing
lack of weather protection, shutter speed could be 1/8000.
only one cross focus point.
battery chager is easy to remove from the socket when done charging exposes the pins
wish i could connect my lights to it though, without having to buy another bit of kit.
no compact flash slot
coming from a 7d i miss the af system, better focusing screen, joystick controller and use of faster cf cards.
nevertheless, the eos6d is a full-frame digital slr.
relatively heavy. lack of built in flash unit.
complicated (but that's a virtue too as it has lots of features). menus were all in chinese when i first turned it on.
kit (ef-s) lenses of eos 450d and 60d unusable so new wide angle lenses required. stepping up to full frame has cost implications.
wifi does not transfer images from camera to pc
when i bought the camera i realised that the built in flash would affect battery performance.  i tried to buy (as i usually do for all my cameras) a spare backup battery.  the lp-e17 is not in stock anywhere.
i think for the price canon could have included a cheap infra red remote trigger. the really big let down however,  is the lack of a built in viewfinder. you can buy one from canon but its price is prohibitive.  i personally feel that using a viewfinder helps keep the camera more stable than using screens at 'arms length'.
it doesn't have gps and i couldn't get it to link to my phone via the canon app. i have a gopro which links to my phone via an app - it's slick and easy, the complete opposite to the canon one. they need to review this. it's well below what i've come to expect from them.
no paper user manual
qset button feelcheap
would have benefitted from a built in evf but the optional one works well.
nothing so far. the only thing i would point out is that the batteries for the camera are expensive.
uses sd memory so have to replace all my high speed cf cards
nothing really
remembering all the little things that make a picture great
but very good all the same
no gps and creative filters can only be used in jpeg format only.
cant find anything bad about it. only the price a bit high to buy
feels cheap in the hands
quite expensive considering theres not many extra features that makes it differ
no connector for studio flash lead which i know is a bit old fashioned and even i use a radio transmitter . just useful back up in my older 40d. but very minor point
depth of field preview not what i expected from using an olympus om10 years ago.  it doesn't really show depth of field when the image dims so much
no memory card verges on parsimonious.
you need to read the manual to really appreciate the full configurability on offer to you.
i could not find anything in the documentation to say how fast a memory card should be used. i found one review that said it is designed for udma 6 which i think is 133mb/s. i bought a 90mb/s card to which it writes very quickly.
nothing
you would think that a camera of this quality would have a lens hood supplied and a protective coating or cover for the display screen.
haven't found any yet!
due to pressure of work i haven't spent as much time using the camera as i would have liked to but to date i have found no bad points with either the camera or the lens.
possibly the weight, as it is slightly heavier than the 50d. other than that, nothing at all.
lens suffers from zoom creep between around 24mm-50mm when pointed vertically upwards or downwards.  in reality it is not a big issue.  relatively slow lens (f/3.5-f/5.6) so not great for action in low light. it was a toss-up between this and the ef-s 17-55mm f/2.8 lens.  in the end i chose this for the extra zoom range and the fact that i don't shoot much low light action.  it does not sound like much, but even the extra 2mm coverage at wide angle is quite significant - great for landscapes.   canon, why no lens hood?
alot to master
its a bit heavy but hey you don't get all this good stuff without adding some weight.  i'm also finding it difficult to get used to the on/off switch on the left, for me its just not intuitive.  you hold the body of the camera with your left hand and press the shutter with your right, its slightly annoying to level the camera with finger on the button to find you have to re-adjust your grip to turn it on.  i've overcome this by setting the auto-off time to its maximum so i rarely end up with it going off - now i just need more battery power!
expensive - but you pay for what you get - a great product.
non
read the manual!!! its not for a the point-and-shoot level photographer.
the only thing i don't like about the 7d is the strap, it get in the way and its uncomfortable, if canon made the strap with a quick release and  more comfortable that would be great, i will just have to go and buy one.
no bad points.
a bit heavy. don't expect too much from a built-in microphone.
tight grip demanding slr
i've gone from a eos 400d to the 7d which in quality is a big jump it also expects you to have mastered the 400d to get the full binifit of the step.
a little heavy
i haven't found any bad points - as yet.
a little bit expensive compared to some similar cameras

video focusing is a bit tricky and in fact, i've not managed to work out if/how to do this yet.
the auto focus only has 9af points. i'm not finding that an issue but many might.
customer services at simply are hopeless. i asked for a manual on the camera in english as i was supplied with one in japanese. from their responses and failure to supply a manual after some months, i can only draw the conclusion that these people are totally disinterested in their customers
i wish that canon had left out wi fi and gps, and, instead put more relevent technology into the camera, such as more focal points to help with landscape and movement. the scene modes make this camera seem like an amateurs when it is far from it. makes you feel a bit patronised.
no bifurcated viewing screen.
wi-fi was a bit fiddly to set up at first, used video from canon learn usa to set it up, could have read manual :)
no
hdr doesn't store also raw. gps take long time to syncronize.
point but the 24-105 lens is quite a heavy-weight and takes a little getting used to.

found the touch screen a little awkward at first. using a case for a different ixus camera whenever you take the camera out the selector toggle slides to video
could be cheaper
no bad points.
can't think of any, very happy with this camera
possibly a bit too 'automated/gimmicky' for the real photo-freaks when compared with say, the superb panasonic lumix dmc-tz10 or the (rather more expensive!) canon powershot g11.
nothing
only small minus point is the getting used to touch screen technology. you get used to it after a while though!
did have to wait for a memory card.
nothing!
need to handle delicately given the entire back is a lcd screen
not many really.
no panorama features ...
one bad point i would say is because of the sexy design of the frame the front cover has a radius in all directions, which means the base surface area is very small and makes the camera rather unstable to stand for self timer shots.
the usb port cover is a bit awkward to open and you need to be a bit ambidextrous when deleting images.
initial difficult functionality but after getting used too, some really good gimmicks.
it takes time to understand all features. still trying to understand the features.
touch screen can be a bit fiddly and it took a little while to work out how to use all the functions.
up to now i cannot find any fault at all with this camera
touch screen annoying at times as can turn off flash when you take out of pocket.
do not come with a memory or mini hdmi cable .
doesn't always focus very well
no user manual and no usb lead!!
i didn't realise that you also need to purchase a lens so was  a little disappointed that i had to spend more and purchase a lens.  its not made clear that you need to do that.
need more info on how to use with pc
2) 14 day warranty on battery, now in dispute as i haven't had 14 days use.
there is a product recall since the sensor is faulty. should not have wasted my money on a rubbish product,
you have to download a proper manual to get into any detail
doesn't shoot raw {but i knew that before i purchased it}. electronic viewfinder{not included} very expensive.
no eye viewer, i believe there is one but it's sold separately
nothing so far - but i have  only had the just over seven days
didn't accept 128 gbyte sd card.
battery life slight issue so would advise getting spare battery
maybe a little overpriced - but then it is a new product.
i expect it is a matter of keeping the cost down but surely an interface cable to enable me to download to my laptop could have been included.
there is no viewfinder, so loses a lot of points for that
focus and depth of field seem to drop off a bit at high zoom levels
changing the mode each time is a little time consuming, i would prefer the modes to be present on regulator kind of thing (like canon powershot a650is which i have used previously). the battery life could have been longer so for longer travelling plan better to have a spare one.
battery life limited, battery door flimsy. spare battery pricey. no manual and the cd supplied covers more than one model so hard to see the relevant info. no separate trash button.
nothing worth noting
my camera arrived completely broken, when i turned it in there was a terrible grinding sound and a lens error, there was no stock in my local store and i needed a camera urgently for my holiday. they couldn't courier me a different one and it was very stressful getting out sorted even though it was there fault.
the purchase did not include a memory card so i had to buy one before i could try the camera
not found any .
haven't found any yet but still just trying it out.
buttons are too small and flat for a womens hands so for a male it is a lot harder. makes it impossible for my husband to use our brand new camera. a real shame.
fidly control size
some small buttons make handling a bit tricky at times but this is a reasonable trade off for the very compact size of the camera.
rather flimsy plastic zoom lever
strange arrangement of controls
awful image quality, i almost sent it back, but this camera is only for underwater, so we shall see when i get an opportunity to try it in that environment.
it leaked ruining a complete holidays worth of shots, i got it because i could take photos under water, i had 2 days left had to take pictures on my mobile phone :-(
not many really - i would prefer to be able to create panaoramas on the camera, rather than on the computer afterwards (the picture stitch program makes it easy though). also the attachment point for the wrist strap is a removable knob which didn't seem like the most secure way of holding it
and taking the picture, under certain light conditions. i have a nikon that does the same thing, and it is a severe handicap for taking action pictures!
rather large in size
some menu functions are not easy to find in a hurry.  battery life seems quite short (compared to another new dslr camera purchased recently).  overall a great little camera - underwater point and shoot!
still a bit large
noise from the auto focus comes out on the sound track of the video when played back, making an annoying click.
i would like a camera of this size to have had a view finder,  screen image in bright sunlight is difficult to see.
no strap to go round the neck,heavier than i realised.
no bad points really but you must use nimh batteries or they dont last.
batteries dont last long with this camera
is a little larger than i'm used to, larger then my a720.
poor image quality especially in low light conditions. it is almost unacceptable.
manual pop up flash if i was looking very hard for something
no view finder have to use screen.
feels abit plastic, lacking some features
sterrible software - easier to copy from my computer
i get lines on pictures and videos when pointed towards bright lights ! - have contacted canon re this problem
battery life is useless - a set of duracel ultra lasts around 4 days taking approx 20 pictures and 15 seconds of video.  just putting another set of batteries through and if not satisfactory will be sending back for a full refund.
very sore on batteries and it only takes the aas. after using flash, the delay is considerably long before you can take another shot. very frustrating
no raw capability.
image quality suffers a bit in the automatic mode
no white balance trim, fairly slow in operation for example slow write to card, macro indifferent.
a little large for a pocket camera
cant say it has a bad point so far .been very pleased with the purchase
it is used by batterry double aa and extra money for cover for camera, batterry rechargble and rechargle machine.... :( approximately 200gbp)
flash not motorized. a little bulky
-
the battery life is very short. i bought an extra battery and still managed to get through 2 in one day - and that was just with normal photo's, minimal flash and no video!
pop up flash  forgetting to move finger!
the lifting flash is in a silly place
first camera i have ever bought that did not come with a lead to down load pictures to a pc.
does not come with a usb / hdmi transfer cable
doesn't have lead to download to computer included
the battery compartment is hard to open and removal of a battery is cumbersome.  and canon's customer service fobs you off and isn't the quickest, it took them nearly a month to finally answer questions, questions that should've been answered by the manual. the camera has been sent back for repair, which going by other comments online is inconclusive.
battery life could be better, you need to have a spare handy.
haven't found any yet
supplied handbook is poor and relies on downloading a pdf from the canon website
little bit heavier than i was expecting but nothing too bad
although most compact cameras seem to require you to press the shutter button half way prior to taking a shot, i did have a small problem when everything seemed to go blank for a fraction of a second, bt now even that is of no consequence now i am used to it. i only wish that there was a lens cap or something to protect what could be a fragile shutter.
the camera is fantastic but don't buy from simplyelectronics. they delivered my camera after 3 weeks, not the 10 days they claimed and only after i emailed 10+ times. it seems from other reviews online that people have had to wait far longer for their camera. i am also not sure if the warranty is valid in the uk. buy from a decent company and you won't be disappointed.
no instruction manual.
wife not easy to use
slightly on the heavy side and i was amazed that it wouldn't take any photo's without a memory card installed. ie it seems to have no internal memory.
i don't like the fact that you have to manually pop up the flash.
flash not so strong
from new, had a shutter blind fault. the canon lens blinds are always very flimsy. sent it back.
no instruction booklet which does not make things any easier
nothing specific.
nothing really, though you do need a tripod or steady surface for pictures with high magnification
lack of a panoramic feature.
not found any........ :-)
3. the cashback deal has to be made on-line through canon and involves giving out your bank account details and uploading an image of the receipt.
more info needed in the printed manual, had no time to read on-line manual before holidays.
could not find a red version anywhere so had to buy second choice, black.
no instruction book or guarantee. it said on box not to be sold out of side japan?  no address or phone number to contact anybody.
take too long time to auto focus and not good to be used for point and shoot
the zoom is exceptional but anything over 18 x zoom needs a tripod or resting on something.
the only things i don't like are the manually raised flash and the lack of optical viewfinder, but i really am being picky to mention anything, after all it is a proper compact camera.
it's a rip off!!!!!! no accessories! no case, no instructions, no mini tri pod basically nothing but the camera, 1 battery, charger that's it. a very basic start up instruction and that's it!!! all of these have to be bought!!! rip off!!!
on full zoom there is some picture shake.
absolutely delighted but did not any guarantee documentation.
just can't get the wi-fi to connect to my i-pad.
image stabilization can be improved in zoom mode.
using other than the auto setting is not intuitive
low lighting affect video and photo quality
the write speed to card is slow.
haven't used it long enough to think of one
be prepared for a battle of wits and severe tests of patience when setting up the wifi facility
if you need reading glasses have to put these on off as no viewfinder
buttons are so small, difficult to use
battery life is not that brilliant especially doing video. bought a couple of extra batteries to cover this shortfall. .
manual flash
the box came with no instructions or any paperwork -not even a get started document so i had to even get someone to show me how to set the language to english and went on line eventually to find a user guide.
would like a viewfinder but with the big screen it is not a problem
no bad points to speak of
no bad points noted.
still struggling with uploading photos using the wireless facility. cannon should optimise the process for those snappers with little patience for technical detail.
struggling to set up the wifi on the laptop
nothing yet
buttons a bit close together so it is easy to accidentally press the wrong one, particularly the connect to a network button.
the canon pc software is much less intuitive and capable than the camera itself.
not enough  rubber patches for fingers to grip camera
no raw
miss not having  a view finder. screen in bright conditions almost goes black when rotated from landscape to portrait use
doesn't have built in geo tagging and panorama feature
takes a bit of time to get used to
have not found much yet apart from built in flash.
no gps.
would be even better if it could be a little more compact
on/off
no problems so far
its heavy so needs a tripod for long shots
can not think of any
maybe just a little too complex.
no built in gps
i feel that the camera itself is a bit bulky to be carried as a pocket camera.
no view finder
limited use for actions shots due to shutter lag and relatively short telephoto, but this is to be expected.
a big improvement on the g12 although, at double the cost, it should be.
slightly larger in size than i would have settled for. the g12 was more the size i wanted but the quality of the photo's won the day.
looks rather hard compared with others.
movie button to soft and too easy to operate by mistake.
not suited to close macro
no one
- can be more portable
which means that i have a portable 'instruction book' which is necessary because there are far too many adjustments/camera adjustments to remember and you need a quick 'ready reference' reminder that you can have with you.
disappointed that it doesn't store pics in raw format
ni instruktions cd
colour rendition poor brown soil comes out purple and red tends to be flourecent and lacks detail.also the camera seems to have problems focusing.
macro ( especially diving photos : keep your g12!!!)
lack of simple viewfinder. display screen feels vulnerable
a little bit short autonomy, no video high speed.
lack of viewfinder and also top circular program selector is to easy to move and often moves when pulling out of the case.
4. why is the optional evf so expensive...
strap too close to buttons.
no!
battery doesn't last long at all and is very expensive to have a spare - hence the value for money low score
the function wheel is my least favourite part as it was on my canon g10
takes some time to master how all the buttons work in case you want to personalise the options, e.g. how to change iso, exposure and aperture manual mode. is different from dslr canon.
heavy for a compact - and not that very compact either.
lens obstructs view finder
charger hasn't got uk plug
something is wrong with canon's dpp for converting raws. contains a number of features, i find somewhat useless in the real world.
slow focusing in low light. not for your action photographer.
poor close focus distance. needs an adapter to take filters. video performance mediocre. optical viewfinder poor but good to have one. not a fast handling camera.
software suite not windows 8 compatible
a bit slow, but who buys a compact for action shots?
the wide end of the lens needs to be wider.
as big as a system camera
expensive
el visor no es electr\xf3nico sino optico con lo que los ajustes se hacen en pantalla. a la maquina silo le faltaria el wiffi para ser perfecta
view finder
not quite pocket sized (unless you have big pockets).
no lense cover -
aucun, mais toujours long pour la livraison, 1 mois, ce qui cause de belles sueurs froides...
ras
i would want notice french
canon is not cheap.  but you get what you pay for and it is worth paying a bit more for quality.
need a bit of time spent to get to know features.  not really a bad point.  also 'misty' pics when lens got 'smeared' due to weather.  again, prob more my error not cameras.
in poor light the automatic focus can get confused, which can lead to blurred pictures.
cant think of any at the moment
should come with a case
my wife can use it.
battery life not very long, the silver on the front scratches easily, doesn't come with a case or sd card.
no sd card included
not found any yet.
not sure i had any bad points
sometimes struggles is soft light
to slow get get good shots of children but i didn't expect otherwise. use reflex camera for this.
i am not aware of any. perhaps it is worth mentionong that the mechanism that closes the lens is clever (integral to the camera), but do not allow nieces, cousins etc to fiddle with it as it is vulnerable to breakage - as i found out with my own camera
less features than other cameras.
cannot edit photos on the camera, as you can with a coolpix. size might be too small for some people.
could do with some more information in the printed manual you receive with the product.
repeat photographing by holding the take button down is a little slow.
zoom not good enough while movie/video recording
considering the price, we have nothing to complain about.
screen size
like many cameras, expensive to repair and cheaper to replace.  seems a shame that the damaged camera(s) can't be recycled.
no technical bad points but would have liked a cloth pouch supplied to keep it in.
some of my pictures didn't show up when i upload them to pc...after some research i discovered that the class of sd card wasn't high enough for the camera...(had a high capacity class 4) when i upgraded to a class 10 i had no problems at all. not really a camera problem but wish i'd known sooner...
would have appreciated a memory card so that i could have used it straight away.
it is missing some settings which all earlier cannon cameras seem to have. very disappointing.
is a point and shoot camera which is excellent but not good for more intricate photography.
should come with strap
battery has to be removed for charging, not that much of a problem.
they dont bounce very well when dropped from a height - this is how i broke my first one!!!
my preference is for a viewfinder option for outdoor shooting and the 105 doesn't have one but no other bad points or habits.
shutter speed could be better
very slow at taking photo's
seems to be hard to find accessories such as uv filter/lens protector
eye view finder is awkward and low definition
cannot take filters without an extra adaptor. viewfinder could be better, but not too bad.
n o bad points really except maybe to many bells and whistles which can complicate things a bit but then i am maybe a bit old fashioned.also would be nice if it could use aa batteries.
poor placement of dpad controls,hand presses buttons etc inadvertently causing much profanity!
a bit fiddly if your used to the dslr cameras,but you soon adjust ,at high end magnification you must keep stable to keep on target, again you will soon find ways , ie mono pod , tripod , breathing technique ,
haven't found any yet
easy to push the timer function by mistake
the design of the camera grip can result in the lower area of the thumb activating the timer delay. a bit frustrating.
too easy to press function buttons, etc., inadvertently
a bit slow on focusing when you need to take something fast.
no raw image on auto setting, no exposure compensation on auto setting and tends to over-expose on auto setting. in fact auto is of little use to me (photographing birds). i use p and 'sports' mode mostly.
autofocus is a bit slow.
as yet i have found no fault with the camera.
would like to be able to take panoramic photos without having to stitch them.
would be better with aa batteries as the power source.
not supplied with a bag, which a camera like this really needs.
with just a few days of use i can not yet point out anything.
slow chip speed. slow focus.
no usb cable. bit mean
delivery is slow
hahaha , yeah ok, good luck finding any !
printing out a 200 plus user guide
no gps tag on photos
now bulb settinfg.
multi-function buttons- my old fingers invaribly activate an additional function to what i wanted. i'm very much on a learning curve and this should not put off more agile photographers.
no lens cap suplied in deal
don\xb4t see any .
video recording time is short
just finding way round - a quick start paper leaflet would be useful rather than going thru the dvd tutorial
can't find any at themomment
no usb cable so you have to get a seperate one and battery runs down fairly quickly so its wise to have a spare.
i would like to see an open ended shutter speed for nightscapes, the camera has a 15sec slowest shutter speed. but i guess i'm just being picky, it is a bridge camera after all
a very plastic feel to the body (not a big deal though)
not good in poor light
you will need a good memory to be able to remember what's in the 280 page on line manual (or pay \xa38 for a hard copy)
only one so far---the record button is to close to the thumb hold and occaisionaly switches on whilst holding the camera.
low quality evf
it's a bit too easy to accidentally change settings due to the layout of the controls - but i suppose i will get used to this.  hardly anyone will want a full slr camera after trying this.
not found any yet
have not found any yet
battery could last longer.
the rear buttons are a little too easy to access compared to the sx40 and can easy be changed by a stray finger when shooting, the addition of a small ridge around the buttons would prevent this.
a bit too easy to inadvertently press the wrong button whilst doing something else.
looking. ther may be some but i find it fine
longer exposures are limited to 15 seconds at iso80. raising the iso means less than 15 seconds, so not really that useful for night photography. the lumix fz200 offers 60 seconds in comparrison.
to be honest i have not found any. i put 10 out of 10 because i really love it :) i took my time on choosing a new camera and looked at 3 different ones before settling on this one. i think the fact i took my time made sure i made the right choice :)
complicated to follow the instruction manual - but then i'm technologically challenged anyway !!!
toggle wheel a bit awkward
no thread on the end of the lens to connect extra lens so you have to purchase a 67mm adaptor to attach extra lens to and that is a bayonet fitting onto the camera lens....could be a better design !!!
over priced being a new model
at present not found any bad points
images are a little grainy.  i expect more from canon and a camera of this price.  had i discovered this within the 7 days (delayed opening) i would have returned it.
sound recording low quality (muffled, unclear), and no option to add an external microphone to compensate for this defect.
small speck of dust inside lens but does not seem to affect photos so we will live with it.
you have to know what you are doing as its like a dslr.
/
controls are difficult find
does not come with a case or a memory card for instant use
small sensor
a bit heavy
no bluetooth (connection with iphone)
would be best to buy from a uk based company.
viewfinder takes some getting used to as image is blurred but this should not put you off buying this camera.
the flash isn't automatic
also no usb lead provided.
takes a while to understand all the functions.
did not know it was manufactured for the japanese market only
auto-focus is not always quick and can take a while to get the actual item you want to focus on
too early to have had time to fully try out everything
it has a lot of buttons by the right hand and i found my thumb quite frequently hitting the red timer button unintentionally.   this is a weakness.   also there is a relatively long time in the focus adjusting itself which precludes any photos needing a fast shoot or you will miss it scenario.
build could be better but saying that it is not bad and is more than acceptable, the evf is nothing to shout about other cameras have much better ones but it is usable and you do get used to it,  i think it comes down to what you want and although some cameras may have better build and evf's i would rather have high quality images any day of the week and the sx50 hs can give these time after time.
nothing at the moment as not used it much yet.x
position of record button
easy to press buttons you don't want to press......record button difficult to accesss, should be nearer the edge
a little complicated getting started.... but that may just be me!!
too many features
cannot fit a camera lens to it. the camera shop said it has not got any thread to fit a protective lens to it.
self timer switch is easily caught when holding camera if looking through the electronic viewfinder
not found any yet.
it's a bit too easy to press the function buttons below the thumb grip by accident
come across nothing up to now
some of the confgurations are complicated to access via the menu screen.
not worth mentioning.
sometimes hard to focus when in macro mode.
only comes with digital instruction disc, no written manual.
not used to macro yet, so images may improve...
if your not used to these type of cameras they do take a little getting used to, my advice is read the instructions carefully, there are many many features on this camera
no bulb and min 15 seconds
timer button is positioned so it is easily knocked on by mistake
quite big.
handling, manual flash
low megapixels compared to most modern day cameras.
quite complicated to get to grips with
sellers poor service
because it is a bridge camera the f stop is limited. slow shutter speed
not found any yet, hope it stays that way
bit confusing at first how to change functions
no written manual.
can catch the timer part of the disk wheel on rear of camera best to keep thumb on thumb rest section of camera
very sensitive function disc which is easily activated by mistake.
still waiting for the \xa350 cashback
panorama photo is missing / not enough image filters or options like on instagram (matbe not specific to this camera..)
lots to learn about to use to full potential.
not much in the box!
very noisy at high zoom. looses your settings (unless you save in c1 or c2 ), if camera is turned off.
not a solid case
bulkier than a compact
no editing effects or frames as with similar cameras.
heavy on telescope when fully extended and keep steady when taking photos.
not found any yet
no paper book instructions
non for me.
i wish it would have also space for batteries.
haven't found any
manual on disc a bit fiddly to work through.
ummm... no paper manual (being really picky).
when changing from still to video and vice-versa, the image becomes blurry. it only corrects itself once it is restarted.
battery life seems to be a little short
not really a bad point, but i do like to look through a viewfinder rather than at a screen, i still think you can frame better this way, especially in bright sunlight or lowlight situations.
instructions are only on discs, would be nice to have them printed.
like so many cameras, it is not waterproof soshooting in the rain may require a waterproof case.
shoot response is slower than expected
no viewfinder.
i think i would like a flick open hard cover (or clip on hard cover) on the front to protect the lens assemby in its
battery isn't great. need a backup. and slow motion only last for 30 secs.
the battery life is quite poor.  the build is a little fragile so it's not a good camera for people who are on the go and need their camera to be rough and ready.
night photos are not as clear as i'd want back over all love the camera
some expert controls are difficult to find
short battery life
up against modern 'micro' sized compacts - this feels like a brick
very disappointing battery life.  did not even last the day on holiday.  i have now purchased a spare battery!!!!
battery life
there has been some criticism about battery life. i haven't experienced that by myself, however i would have bought 2nd battery if offered at the time of camera purchase.
no bad points so far
price, difficulty to find cover (protection) and battery.
shame there was no memory card included to enable usage out of the box.
iso sensitivity limited, so need to be wide angle in low light if the flash is forced off. shutter lag could be shorter.
can't think of any.....its a brilliant little camera
the video on the camera isn't as good as the picture quality- but it's not a video camera so this is to be expected
the biggest fault with this camera, is that it is very slow. any fast motion will be a blur, and it takes far too long writing to sd card. if you need a quick snapper, look away.
not great image quality in lower light.
no included memory card
occasionally auto will select the wrong image settings usuually macro instead of landscape if you have had the camera face down
inclusive rechargeable batteries would have been a bonus.
battery cover is very loose every time it opens.
the battery and memory card container has a fiddly cover.
image quality so poor for a 16 mpx camera. not worthy for the price. build quality is not good.
have to buy memory card seperately makes it quite expensive purchase
have not found any yet, but will let youknow if i do
still practicing
- has't got signatures of buttons
the ac connector wiring was for uk 110v wall outlet system. the finnish system supports 240v wall outlet connectors. a small surprise but quickly fixed.
image quality not what i expected. auto focus poor.
time between pictures could be quicker
nothing to complain.
high-definition video does not play well on most computers.
images are poor when dark
no cons in my opinion.
for the price i have yet to come across any bad points.
non so far.
- live view focusing quite slow (normal for this mode  but still annoying)
focus is slow in live view.
manufactors should not spend they time on including  a video camera in a still camera. focus on the still camera only - and we'll save some money and get higher quality.
slow autofocus in live view
plastic body may not be agreeable to everyone but it does make the camera lighter so maybe not a bad point at all.
no autofocus on video. plastic body, no cf option, only takes sd cards.
nothing else.
so its a constant..shoot, look, replace view finder. shoot.
nothing serious so far, although a little expensive compared to 550d.  some hesitation when focusing in live view.
not so keen on the 'squishy' buttons.
only one i can think of so far is that bulb mode is a separate mode which isn't really a problem but i'd prefer the setting to be accessed from whichever function you are in i.e. tv or av mode rather than having to change the mode when you need to go beyond a 30 sec exposure.
like others i wont use the video. price. the canon experience voucher that was offered with this model has been rejected as there is no date on the purchase confirmation. new cards were needed as it takes sd not cf cards. also, quite importantly check which processing software being used and see if compatible with the 60d. i used cs3 and found it could not process the raw files from the 60d. you can download a converter to dng files but i did'nt like this idea so i now use cs5 which is compatible.
the weight
plastic screen scratches easily.
in movie mode it doesn't auto focus  so picture goes out of focus
a bit on the heavy side, but with so much circuitry inside there is no other way!
have not found any yet, but have only had it for a short while. i previoiusly had the 400d, which i was very pleased with, but the 60d feels much more professional.
hardly anything
body, not made of magnesium alloy.
features and controls can be slightly daunting if new to dslr photography, but the manual is very easily to understand.
menus a little complicated
it was set up in chinese or japanese so i had a hell of a time getting it to english
a tad expensive, only aps-c.
plastik body
heavy compared to others of similar features
shutter seems a bit clunky and noisy. one huge point to consider is that for post processing i was using cs3. however, the raw formats created by the 60d can not be read in cs3 meaning you have to convert to dng files or purchasing a software package that suports the raw files.
i forgot to buy memory card and lans  that camera . now i m using my friend lens
mode dial has video right at the end so yo uhave to rotae it all the way rather than the shortest route.
everything was cheap except the price
no cropping tool on camera
have not found any
no english manual!
no bad points to mention really but if you are looking for a camera to fit in the palm of your hand this is not for you.
no
the build quality is not as robust as many of the pro canon dslr, or some entry level nikons.
nothing specific
yet to find any
no manual included.
heavy
no manual booklet
d400 add ons like camera grip and battery are different. sd type memory card is extra.
the camera has the old digic 4 pressessor, i would go for the new 700d camera instead for more up-to-date features
plastic built
build quality
there is no manual instruction book.
can't find any
heavy
nothing worth mentioning
just thing photoshop does not find the raw file
not found any as yet.
it is a bulky and weighty camera but nothing compared to a dslr added with a lens
slight niggles and these are down to the fact my other camera is a professional slr. multiexposure is pretty slow, seems to average about one a second for me, same applies to bracketing feature which if you're trying to photograph anything moving means you've often lost the subject. when on auto the camera does have a tendancy to go for higher iso settings to favour a higher shutter speed. the video feature provided produces reasonable results but the zoom isn't available all the time and it would have been nice to have full hd. the digital zoom is very poor
can't zoom in and out while filming but thats the pettiest thing to find wrong with this camera.
shoulder strap instead of a hand grip for a pocket camera? hdr mode self processes and does not give the opportunity to process the three images separately.
possibly only the weight, but overall even the extra weight was acceptable given the benefits achieved.
not found any yet.
i had a g11 and although the full hd video has been added to the g12, i think (if i remember correctly) that the 'sunset' scene mode has disapeared. i got some great sunsets from the g11 but took a few with the g12 and they look a little bit limp (not as vivid in colour dept.)
i'm not a big fan on using the screen on the back to compose a photo i'd rather use the view finder. the view finder is ok but it doesn't have a focusing square.
doesn't quite have the solid feel of the g10 even though it is the same weight.
the lens cover can open unintentionally if you're not careful.  i had to get my original purchase replaced as the lens got scratched, so i have now bought a case.  not having a hard copy manual is a drag, but seems par for the course now.  i bought a g12 book which is better than the manual anyway.
no instruction book, it's all on a compact disk, which is a bit of a drag.
a bit bulky for a hand bag but my philosophy is have the camera out most of the time and take loads of pics. i it gets in the way pass it round
bulky compared to most compacts / subjects close to camera are best viewed with lcd screen rather than optical viewfinder because sight-lines are different (not a problem with subjects further away) / optical viewfinder doesn't show any shooting info (eg speed, f-stop) / quite expensive
heavy to carry in pocket but not too much so. not 1080p video.
not being able to zoom whilst filming
controls are a bit to close to one another
i'm used to a few more megapixels.
it can be difficult locating the function you desire at first until you familiarise yourself through regular use
too many settings!!! and i wish cannon gave you a case!
price is too high.
low light performance is still a little on the noisy side, apart from that i have no quibbles.
needs costly special lens adapter to attach 58 mm filters etc
to easy to press feature buttons when not wanted.
menu language only in english and chinese, in manual is explained that you can select other languages as well. in my g11 you can find more. little bit strange that in this you can find only english and chinese only.
viewfinder bit primitive
bought this no camera bag, not convenient, and the price it's not cheap:)
10mp
the viewfinder lens is not very precise.
image quality is not as good as an slr.  but what do you expect from a compact?
maybe a bit heavier than it could for a small size camera.
the controls are a litttle cluttered and it is easy to catch one of the buttons with your thumb. the new control wheel on the front of the camera is a nice touch but you have to be careful not to knock the zoom control which is easy to do if you are in a hurry or have fat fingers.
the viewfinder is small and only works to 5x zoom
no printed manual although pdf included on cd.
not very clear pictures at night
a bit overpriced compared with competition
difficult to grasp some features due to unclear instruction manual in places
slightly bulkier than my old g9
quality/ price
not for inexperienced users
the parallax error from the viewfinder is obvious in close ups, annoying to a user used to a slr camera, but you have to allow for it or move to using the screen, which is bad in bright light
haven't found any yet
buttons a little too close together
small sensor size (as per virtually all compacts)
like all things - no instruction book, you need to go on-line for this.
other cameras now more features than the g series but still has all the features i would ever need
not sure if the camera has a remote
position of microphone on camera
expensive.
in manual mode, only goes to f8 aperture. for a truly versatile camera it needs to go to f16/f22 for deep depth-of-field pictures.
poor optical viewfinder.
have not found one yet
the price.
a little bit chunky
the zoom lever/system is the only small niggle as this is difficult to use accurately due to small size.
the instructions manual is in pdf format only.
still trying to find one
haven't found any yet

touch screen is not ideal for some people as they are very sensitive. it's like having a smartphone rather than camera.
the touch screen is no where near as good as the touchscreen on an iphone and can be a bit annoying at times. some buttons as well as the touchscreen would have been welcome.
battery doesn't seem to hold it's charge very well.
only had it a short while but the early indication is that the battery is rather short of power so i have already purchased a spare one in the event that it runs out too quickly.
white takes a lot of figuring out. still haven't worked it out!!!
touch screen does not always work first time, can be complex in parts until you get use to it. struggled with wifi and needed technical help from canon
zoom range is shorter than similar models. memory card not supplied.
the manual in long and online   not so good when you are not near a computer
as my disc drive doesn't work i have not been able to access the operating instructions yet and therefore am not making the most of all it's features.
only problem is that some of the buttons are a little bit too small for a big guy like me!
ok for me to use, but my father who has big hands struggles to use it due to small size
you'll spend another $60 on a wireless card reader to make wifi feature work. touch screen is fidley and easy to accidentally select the wrong setting just holding the camera.
canon app does not allow save image to ipad photos/photostream. please update to carry out this simple function.
nothing
its hard to see when your taking a picture or while in movie mode in difficult positions for example: if you want to get a low ground shot, you cannot see the screen unless you lay down with the camera. or if you want to take a picture of something above you and you need to reach with your arm, you cannot see the screen. the 60d is perfect becuase the screen is able to flip and rotate. if you want a simple camera and wont be doing complex shots and so on get the canon eos 550d. if you know you will be doing camera shots high shots low shots then get the 60d.
i can't think of any bad points, but the 600d, just launched, has some useful features: articulated screen, wireless control for off-camer flash and a useful left hand grip that just might have made me think twice before purchasing the 550d had it been launched a couple of weeks earlier!
i was dissapionted that 'live view' in manual mode is exposure sensitive, unlike my previous canon 40d. i think the camera feels and handles a bit too light, and is definately overpriced for the build quality.
5) video - didn't realise it was obligatory to get a high powered [not just high gb] memory card for this [though with hindsight it's obvious], and frustrated that it only works in short bursts [7-10 mins i'm told] - still, pretty good for the price.
why can't canon choose a battery format and stick to it? you'll have to buy yet more spare batteries for this one.
i have large hands so purchased a battery pack so that i had slightly more to hold and considerably increase the time of usage between charges
i am sure there are some bad points but as yet i have not found them !
yet another different battery so i had to buy a new spare as the battery from the 450d doesn't fit.
unable to shoot video through the viewfinder. 12 minutes maximum recording time. built in microphone is generally pretty poor, it also picks up the whirring and clicking of the lens. the good news is that there is an external microphone socket.
hd video not as easy to use as a dedicated camcorder
can not use the old batterys from the 20d as canon have changed the coonection !
the viewfinder could be better.
the weight is far too heavy. you can buy a better instruction manual, but it should come with a better manual for people who are not quite so gifted.
thats all ive encountered so far!
for the price - no problems.
if you haven't used a dslr before it is quite a complicated camera. i still feel that i have a lot to learn, before i will feel totally comfortable with all its features.
can't have continuous af whilst shooting hd video - continuous shoot must be at the same focal length
can't think of any!
not full frame, but you should know that going in.
kit lens only average
doesn't sync up ty my external flash unit.
that there aren't enough hours in the day to play with this kit!
relatively cheap construction which does not promise more than average durability in the long run.
haven't come across any yet.
the internal microphone picks up every little noise setting
although i think its well put together and not going to fall apart, it's prone to scuffs and scratches.
no bad points
large to carry around
finding it difficult to get good pictures with external flashgun  purchased fro the last camera will persevere to try and get gun to work properly
a few buttons have been moved around plus menu , apart from that a massive improvement
slightly cheap looking
why are digital slr cameras (in this case camera body only) so expensive? they are more expensive than a good laptop computer.
haven't found any yet.
basic lens comes with this product, ok to start with, but it has a slow reaction time, fps isnt as good as the sony a450, but i didnt purchase for that reason. bit pricey but worth it.
haven't found any yet.
quite heavy if you are only used to using a digital compact camera
extra lenses could always be cheaper :)
steep learning curve if you are not used to a dslr camera. requires back-up batteries because they run down fast.
cant use raw files in photoshop cs3, canon changed the codec on the raw file and they will not open, that is really frustrating
slightly bulky, but much the same as the original slr it replaced...
can't find any yet. lens with the image stability expensive.
lack of hinged monitor, my fault, i should have bought the 600d
have loaded the software, but can't see videos - only hear the sound.
i was hoping that it would be a little easier to capture video.  photos do take up a lot of memory on the pc due to the pixel quality so you need to be ruthless with what you keep.
haven't found any yet but only had it for a few days yet
the only aspect that stops me giving it 10/10 on value for money is the price of canon's own accessories - \xa350+ for a canon battery, \xa325 for a plastic filter adapter etc.
like all cameras with a top dial for different camera functions, it's possible to move the dial accidentally and then take shots on a wrong setting.
some controls a bit fiddly, but i am getting used to them.
can't think of any - i'm really happy with it! (but then i am a complete amateur so not that picky!).
fiddly zoom cotrol when compared to previous model. on/off button too easily caught when putting it away. video button takes up space which could have been used to improve camera useability - it's a still camera!
this is only a 12mp camera which doesnt seem like much today compared to others but consider that this is good enough to print up to a2, probably enough for most....so not really a bad point at all.
not found any yet
apart from faults noted at length elsewhere ie lack of control of settings for long exposures, not straightforward to use filters or lens hood, cost of spare batteries,slightly plasticky feel,lack of raw......
the fact that to add a filter you have to buy a lens adapter at \xa327 in addition to the filter. the lens cap is a little fiddly when using the camera constantly.would have liked an iso 64 setting. you can catch some of the buttons when manipulating the camera, allthough without consequences. the price seems high compared to other similar makes with zoom features, but is much cheaper that a good slr with zoom lens.
no manual provided, you have to print off your own and it's 219 pages long!
more expensive than other makes
plastic case, whitout rubber handling, some controls are misplaced
without eu plug  (just for uk and usa)
non as far as i can see
wish there was a adjustment dial by the shutter button on top as when in manual mode, you adjust everything with the dial on the back and when you use the view finder its hard to get to the dial.
for my personal liking but easy to sharpen with most software.
expensive
no built in hdr feature - but can be done using external software
lack of detailed instructions.
should be sold with memory card included in price.
haven't found any
scratches easily with your nails at the front.
doesn't have raw format
i cant find any.
havent found any yet
spare batteries are expensive.
feels plasticy
zoom motro noise
has so many functions feel i am under using it!!
no hand book. .
limited aperture range.
not yet.
a little weighty
only bad point is quick guide is a bit too quick. needs a bit more info on the different settings
can't think of any.
only complaint is the lens cap isn't as secure as it could be.
no dedicated case.
some buttons a bit fiddly
poor viewfinder - only 2.7 inch screen.
don't buy the camera for its digital zoom - you might be disappointed if you intend to make prints; the optical zoom is great.
minor gripes - this is a shockingly good camera.
i have found the contols a bit awkward but i think that is just down to not being fully conversant with all the features.
rather than a cd rom .
a very long notice to use it!
still struggling to get to grips with this camera. not used to the size (previously only used a compact and thought i should upgrade). finding the location of buttons causing me problems; i keep pressing them as i endeavor to hold/support the weight and get functions that i didn't want. sometimes find it difficult to get back to where i wanted to be.
too early to say
prise en main un peu d\xe9licate, ecran de vis\xe9e d\xe9pass\xe9e
goods not received
if it is reduced its a great value for money if it is full price its a bit pricy ..
flash is not good.
no remote.
the basic manual is too brief. need to find out about key features from the cd. also absence of a weatherproof cover.
manual on cd so either you need to sit at a computer or print it out.
can't think of any bad points at the moment.
slightly complex due to menu function and display options.
cant think of any.
weight
slightly heavier than competition.
will take time to get used to all its functions, certainly not a negative point however.
filenames do not contain the timestamp.
i'm going to go on a camera course so i can learn to use all the features, so i can get the most out of this awesome camera.
non really, it's a high end camera, you can't expect a point and shoot.
i have not found any yet.
some of the functions are not in the same place as my previous camera, but i'm getting there.
it is heavyish so a good camera bag is useful if you are out on long shoots and away from the car.
not a gripe yet but not got to grips with the hd movie mode.
think the manual has to be read first ( apart from the normal settings which users would not need to read about ) to utilise the finer points of this camera.  feel all dslr manufactors should provide a uv filter lens, first thing  an extra for users is the purchase of a protective lens filter.  side flap  covers on camera seem very cheap and nasty these need replacing as it degrades the camera.
cost can be an issue as with all slrs
not for photographers new to dslr
not good under fluorescent lighting in movie mode.
to say that it is a bad point would be over the top, but it would be an improvement if the design of the zoom lens could be modified (without the need for a lock) to stop it drifting out so easily when the camera is being carried by its strap.
haven't found any!
shooting video seems to really run battery down and also manual could be clearer.
the small size of the eight way button on the top right of the back. it could be bigger for more reliable selection.
its hard to master all setting, will take time. some vedio guide should be provided, so that all features would be easy to apply.
not easy to get to grips with all the features, once you read the manual everything becomes clear!
the camera is quite heavy, and you certainly need to read the manual that comes with the camera before using it.
would have preferred a facility to bracket more than 3 exposures as i do lots of hdr photography
nothing to mention.
as it was a kit a bag would have been nice to include too or again recommendations based on it's size.
very hard to hold camera steady because so heavy.  every slight movement shows on film. have to hold camera still. movies and stills use a lot of memory. need an external hard drive to store on.  carrying around. you have to seriously want to film.  not for everyday use.
no full frame sensor but for the price you wouldn't expect it
heavy
steep learning curve if you havent previously owned a canon eos
non that i have found!
18-135mm kit lens is not great - probably should have bought frame only.
slightly over priced
its taken an old man a long time to sort out but i am gettin there
the on/off switch is too close to the photo mode dial, so this can be accidentally changed when switching the camera on and off.
really heavy bit of kit
complicated
alot to learn about it
not found anything i dont like about this camera yet
heavy
need to read the instruction manuel if you want really enjoy all the features
stock lens not as bad as some make out on other review sites.
too many functions to choose from! still plenty of time to learn...
no control over sound
son prix,encore un peu \xe9lev\xe9
no bad points atm.
not so far
compactflash memory cards are hard to find
the pictures even at 400 iso are a little 'grainy' looking compared to my 5d mkii. video eats the battery! raw files at the moment can only be handled by the canon software until adobe and other software houses catch up.
you may need to invest in some higher cf cards, 4mb isn't enough for sports and higher download rate required. udma
it's very annoying that my old bp511 batteries and battery grips (plain and wireless), which fitted my 30d, 40d and 50d, are not compatible with the 7d. i know the 7d is supposed to be in a different product line from the xxd cameras, but was there a need to purposely make the camera incompatible with these expensive accessories?
heavy and expensive but the beast is worth it.
the only issue found thus far has been a slight problem with shutter delay on tv shots. the camera has the facility for shooting hd movies, which (for me) seems an unnecessary addition and it is doubtful that i will ever use it seriously. it is a shame that battery life is slightly reduced on this model, and the price of a second manufacturer produced battery is very high.
no bad points to speak of
my camera skills.
no default flash off setting. setting forgotten when the camera goes to sleep.
4. surprisingly the cr2 raw files can't be opened by photoshop cs3 whereas my previous 350d cr2 files were fine - that's disappointing. i don't like the canon software that much, direct into photoshop is really essential.
i got a tamron 18-270 (is) pzd with the body and they are great together but they do weigh a bit after a timr on your feet.
a bit noisy at high iso. clumsy method of changing the iso rating.
i cannot think of any bad points as yet but i have still got to get used to the cameras finer points.
haven't found any.
learning curve can be a little on the step side to begin with. the only thing missing for me is the ability to take more then 3 bracketed exposure shots at a time.
price - a bit expensive...
selection dial on the left can be accidentaly turned quite easily, maybe it should have a more secure system, but that is a very small minus.
the price.
awesome:-)
need to learn how to use functions
quite heavy but that's understandable as is made of metal, other than that have not found yet
despite the fantastic quality, i can't help but feel it is slightly over priced.
the only downside are the amount of menus and sub menus they take a bit of getting use too
controls can be confusing. time spent setting the camera up for your photography is well-spent. don't expect to just pick this camera up and take amazing pictures. however, this has the tools to create those amazing pictures and rewards those who explore the intricate menus. get a good guide book!
very little - there's a complex learning curve to getting the best out of the camera and i'm only part way up that curve!
a minor point and a very minor one at that, the tear screen could have been made to flip out, that for me is about as negative as it gets.
doesnt fire speed shots in low light settings
price
takes some time to work out all the controls but that's probably mostly my fault to be honest!
grey import - camera manufactured for chinese market but unit as has english internal content as well as other languages and all necessary accessories in english no issues
functions operate differently from other canon camera bodies, which is a tad frustrating.
really bad operational manual supplied so you will need to do a course or order more reading material to get the most out of it.
no bad points
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i think the price could be a bit cheaper and maybe canon should start putting a rear display protector like nikon...but these are not really bad points more suggestions!
still looking.
be nice if it included a mini hdmi ti hdmi cable in the box.
slightly more noise in the image at 100 iso than i was expecting.
expensive canon replacement batteries
baaaaad factory firmware 7.7.7 ? cant update it..
unsuited to less experienced operators. relatively heavy (but this reflects high build quality). expensive
getting to grips with menus
would have preferred off/on switch to match d series, but you soon get used to it.
weight
unfortunately, the software delivered if for asia and oceania (no option for europe)
very very complex menu !!!!
i am still trying to find some, but without much success!
i did not recieve a mannual or pocket book with the camera, i have emailed you, but i am still waiting
menu only in chinese and english
a bit heavy. that's all!
haven't found any yet!!
non
very much heavier than expected.  not for little hands.
not really a bad point, but setting up the autofocus points can be a pain. so many choices, you have to decide what a/f set up suits the type of shooting you do.
video recording has no auto focus while recording. very difficult to control focus properly in manual. but as it is mainly an slr camera. video recording is just a novel addition to most.
can take a while to find your way around.
i have to go to work so i can't be out with it 24/7!
not really a bad point but due to the number of features, the learning curve is steep.
price!
not found any yet
i havent found any yet
haven't seen any bad points?
the 19-point autofocus rarely captures the right spot when striving for a limited dof, so single point is my preferred mode.  the only other sub-optimal feature is the aps-c sensor, but i just couldn't stretch to the 5d.  the weight can be a little tiresome if working at arms' reach for any reason, but the quality feel more than compensates.
many functions.
not many although it is heavier than my last camera.  it is a little bigger. i also wanted a cable release switch but i have found out they are quite expensive and the one from my old camera isn't comaptable
a big jump up in price from the 50d but not twice as good.
a bit costly, but shop round to get the best deal.
white balance needs watching.
uses cf cards rather than sd cards which are at least twice as expensive.
ok
too soon to give an opinion
but sincerly this was the best price on market,and i did my research for a more than 2 month until i found this web site.
haven't found any yet
not found
the large file sizes have slowed my computer down a bit when i process them in aperture or photoshop.
no manufacturer's uk warranty supplied, as its with the distributor (fingers crossed i won't need it), no printed manual and cd manual is a bit basic, no uk plug for charger, but comes with adapter kit, abit pants so purchased one from ebay for \xa38 plus didn't realise the 7d took an compact flash card, so had to invest in a few of them unfortunate as i have lots of sd cards
battery life not great, not at intuitive as the 40d
they've taken away the creative zones, makes you work harder when sometimes you need a quick snap.
chinese model sent, couldn't understand menu systems.
not for the snapshot photographer (unless they have plenty of money) it is not easy to understand the controls if new to photography, but it can be used in full auto. anti-shake system is all in the lenses, and not built in the camera, this keeps the camera for the other built in hardware. does not have the full 35mm size chip, but the aps-c size is very adequate for a4 prints. canon lenses focal length for 24mpixel chips are increased by 1.6 in focal length on this size aps-c chip in the canon 7d.
no full frame! thats it though, this camera is amazing!
bit flat in colour
had a 7d for over a year not found any negative points yet the weight is ok for ne but some may find it a tad heavy
price!
no obvious
bit on the heavy side.
not being full frame!
audio quality is just about average.
cheap strap
the camera uses both ef and ef-s lens... if i had the extra money to replace my ef-s lenses i would have gone for the 5d mark iii
it's going to take months to work out how to use this
a bit heavy
above, very disappointed as reviews stated image quality was excellent hence my purchase.
7d needs own battery and charger, it is not compatible with 50d.
yet to discover them.
not a full frame
the person behind the viewfinder.
took 1000 photos but 95% were out of focus very dissapointed
the price
i am still struggling  to operate it and get good pictures. i still don't know if i did right buying this item paying such a big money.
very poor imaqge quality.
10
not knowing all the features yet
nothing that i've found yet.
can't find any
no english instruction book      nice to have a power lead for charger   no garrentee
nothing worth mentioning
any
but would like, tilt/swivel lcd screen and gps on future model
compact flash - i much prefer sd.
expensive for a crop factor camera
noise above iso 800
you need to read the manual to get the best out of it.
nothing
when you switch the camera on sometimes you change the settings just double check the settings before taking a photo
is there a special problem with my camera ?
no manual in the box
not possible to display the photo in the screen while taking it
with a 1.6x crop factor it extends the focal lengths of your lenses and can prove to be a bonus if you are into sports/wildlife photography. this also is an advantage over the full frame in terms of pixel density. you can read about this in the reviews
high price for canon batteries and other accessories, but a good range of unbranded batteries and alternatives is now available.
don't found till now
not full frame

cf card
sorry i didnt get it sooner :(
not found any yet.
non what so ever
heavy but not as bad as my old canon slr
need to have used a similar camera before
uses expecive cf cards.
does not have a 5 point aeb
might take a while to get the best from the camera as it has much to offer. learning the creative manual options a must to fully appreciate what this bad boy can do.
the version software is not including the french menu and all the other european language
some features take time to access.
when you aren't used working with slr camera's then this one isn't very handy to use.
could have more pre-determined user settings on the mode dial (top lhs. the 40d has more choice than the 7d.
not found yet
joy stick
a bit heavier than expected.
a little expensive
one small niggle - the mode selector dial on top of the camera can easily be turned out of its selected position by brushing against clothing etc. it would be much better if canon made this a lift-and-turn-dial.
price is bit high. manual cheap print, gets heave on the neck after a time
the product manual was a cheap print.
can be a little daunting getting used to al te functions and features.
fiddly with menu at times ...
absolutely nothing
550d and 600d still gives you the same picture quality for half the price.
picture noise worse than expected
i have only just received this canon 7d and so am in the process of testing it against the 7d\x92s i use for work, so at this time i have no bad points to comment on.
don't know if it is a problem or me, but thought i took about 30 photos recently (wasn't important or paying attention, but only 2 were recorded)
haven t found any yet, and doubt i will
not found any ,early days
non.
no af in video mode
n/a
this product was described very badly on your website.   it said nothing to the effect that major component were missing nor that it had been used which clearly it had.   it was simply described as a stock clearance item which could of course mean anything.     i would never ever buy a stock clearance item from jessops again.
dslr intermediates/pros only - absolutely not a first timers to dslr camera. takes time to learn with all the new features and few setup changes (being used to other dslrs)
picture quality on enlaregments is not as good as the 5d mark ii.
expensive, had to change to compact flash memory cards making the overall cost even higher.
not easy to use initially - you need to read the instruction manual - a few times - not really a bad point but something to bear in mind as the camera has so many options on it.
it's a bit heavy but that just shouts build quality.
time to explore all the features!
price is too high and can not download raw without canon hardware
act the lenses are so expensive ive only got the body and borrow my friends lens
no bad points so far
haven't found any yet
expensive canon accessories eg, battery, remote 'anything'.
nothing
only the person behind the camera
little complecated but with practice im sure i will overcome problems with white balance colour choice
type mode which optimises high shutter speed shots with auto focus tracking (as does the 40 d), high/middle iso noise,no uk or canon guarantee
not for absolute beginners!
non that i can think of as i have only had the camera for a few weeks
a big leap from a 400d
update or a firmware update from canon themselves.
have not found any yet.
perhaps a little early to say wether more (smaller) pixels are required with this camera?
would of liked full frame sensor.
no detailed paper manual provided - all on cd.  a simple 'get you started' paper manual is provided which, in truth, is quite sufficient to meet most users total needs although if you want to know exactly what's happening you will need to browse online.
zero!
battery needs charging quite often, so needs a back-up. it would be better to have it rechargeable without taking the battery out.
so far i've not really found any. although the wrist strap doesn't have a fastener on it so doesn't stay on your wrist very well, i'm a bit dubious about carrying it around as i worry that the strap will fall over my hand and i will drop it.
nothing really. no case provided, but avoid the hugely expensive \xa330 canon case and get a better lowepro leather case for under \xa310
no delete button, no mode dial.
the zoom button takes a while to get used to.
did not come with a case or memory card. although the price of the camera is not bad, for a few pounds more it would have been nice to have these items included. i purchased a spare battery and screen protector on ebay for under \xa33. i would recommend buying these.
the menus can be slightly difficult to navigate at first. except that, you cant fault it.
haven't found any yet!
like almost all small digital cameras, it lacks a viewfinder, but otherwise there is little else to criticise. its cost and complexities do justify a better, proper, printed, manual - in english, and the many pages wasted on foreign languages should be used for a much more detailed expose for all the cameras' abilities.
as yet haven't found any bad points.
cannot delete images instantly once taken like i'm used to on the powershot sx210is.  but get used to it later.
like all modern digital cameras it has a tendency to over expose and get the white balance wrong, but you can compensate for all these to produce reliable good quality images. like any very small camera the aperture is small so slower shutter times are required to get good depth and light.
i gave the camera 10's and don't have any bad points
the monitor is not as good as the other competitors.
after only a week of use the red finish is starting to chip off. i have the official canon case for this camera and take care of it so there is no reason for this to happen. i had a black ixus in the past and had a similar problem. come on canon, sort this out!
haven't found any yet
buttons a little fiddly
you can loose it in your pocket its that small
i haven't found any yet.
have yet to come across any!
navigating the menu is a little bit of a faff.
haven't really found any yet
finally - and this really is a minor gripe - the wrist strap does not have a tensioner, so whilst it can be looped over the hand, it cannot be secured; an elastic band has been used to this effect !
program mode isn't what i expected, you can't set the shutter speed or aperture.
had the camera for 2 montsh and no compalints so far, maybe the sound quaity could be a bit better
doesn't come with an sd card or extra battery which would make the deal even better instead of costing an extra 30 quid which took some of the shine off the price.
no camera card included at all.  i had not realised and it was a present for my son.
the simplicity obviously comes with lack of customisation and settings, but that is to be expected from such a point-and-shoot camera.
the only bad point i can say is when you playback video it doesn't playback the audio aswell :s
red eye elimination not as good as some other compact cameras.
have not found any yet.
would have liked a printed manual as still getting to grips with all the cameras features scrolling though the downloaded pages and missing info.
can't find any
zoom takes a bit of getting used to
you don't get a case.
battery needs to be removed for charging which is a pain - i used to have a sony t1 that was better in this respect - the canon software doesn't work properly on my pc failing to upload when the upload oftion is selected - but i probably wouldn't have used this anyway as there are plenty of other utilities includin standard windows stuff to upoad with - minor bad points really
flush, small buttons on rear hard to use. this does not effect full auto but using different programme settings is very fiddly.
no keen on the matt finish in black.
the zoom doesn't happen automatically - even when on auto - you have to fiddle with a small lever at the bottom of the pres button.
it's quite expensive, although not bad value at all
more changes to the set up - my 4th ixus canon and each time i have to learn again and the battery is a different size.
casing a little brittle
no bad points.
the black paint easily wares off. needs a simple delete button rather than fussing with several buttons.
it's no longer in production!
a bit of a faf setting self timer. metering in macro mode a bit uncertain in bright sunlight - ok in diffuse conditions.
discontinued.
i didn't realise it didn't come with a memory card
not many. smaller than 230hs hence buttons more fiddly, but i've big hands. fine for normal use.
positing of the flash means it's easy to accidentally have your finger block the flash. some of the more complex photo presets can take time to master, such as colour replace.
no real bad points other than perhaps a protective case would seem a good idea.
very few at this price. if this was up near its original cost, there might be a few niggles (slight chromatic abberations and a softness to the image etc) that might be a little less forgivable. but this is a superb little camera!
buttons shuffled from previoius hd models, so not as intuitive to use as i'd have liked
no viewfinder, average screen.
the zoom lever is a bit over-sensitive and it can be difficult to control.
some areas of the user interface a bit clunky but these are a minor detail with respect to the overall performance
only lasted me three months - once the extended lens is knocked, the camera doesn't work.  i find this with all of the canon ixus cameras so have now switched to panasonic lumix tz20.
as i dropped my canon ixus 130, and the lens broke, i'm worried the same could happen to this one too - but that's probably my fault.
nothing really
not found any so far!
nothing comes to mind
image quality in low light conditions
battery life not brilliant when used heavily - ie. lasted 1.5 days with heavy use.  camera body looks like it could scratch easily.
fells cheap in the hand, trade off for being so light a weight i guess
has 'stitch' function but no panoramic sweep function.
quite small for someone with big hands
menus a bit fussy
night shots/low light. no sunset option as in older canons. colour accent pictures without backup of normal one
should come with case and memory card
when using movie mode you have to pan across very slowly to give camera time to auto focus otherwise bluring will occur. wind noise can be a problem with outdoor sound.
fragility of telescopiclens struc
the lens got stuck and had to get it replaced....
(though i haven't read the manual, so i might just be missing it)
the only thing that annoys me a bit is that it doesn't remember settings. eg changes to aspect ratio, or selecting vivid in creative auto. once it's turned off then on, it has forgotten. i might be able to get around that by making use of the user settings, where you can setup and save favourite settings, but i haven't tried yet.
for the money? nothing bad so far.
manual is a bit overly complicated and requires a lot of concentration to understand.
earnings from my part time job. additional lenses could be costly.
just one thing.the kit lense (18-55mm is) is not performing well in low light conditions
lens - definitely i need to buy another better quality lens.
it took me  a while to figure out how the video worked. i thought that all you did was turn to the video symbol and press the shutter button
are their any, haven't foubd it yet
wish you could view the instructions in the viewfinder as well as on the screen.
get told off by my wife for taking too many photos.
nothing.
not yet - i just need to learn how to use it properly!
small camera body is difficult to hold with more than 2 fingers if you have big hands, solved by buying an ext battery grip. we can now shoot 4hrs+ 1080p video with the twin battery powered grip. ;o)
only one i have found so far. on the wite balance setting option you have fixed preset values representing 5200k 7000k etc. i would have prefered the actual k option included in the list, surely it is only a small change in the software since if you select auto white balance it can and will select k values between the fixed presets.
a few buttons have been moved to allow for the tilt/swivel screen to be fitted.  this will take some adjusting to for those who are very familiar with the layout of earlier models. this is a small niggle that will disappear with a month of usage i'm sure.
curry's took 4 days to process my order which was placed at the beginning of december. i was told this was due to all orders being manually checked to prevent fraud as it's more common at this time of year. if this was the case, it should have been stated at the time of order but wasn't and took a phone call from me after 3 days of waiting to find this out.
when shooting in video mode with the supplied lens you need good light or the images will be dark.
wish i'd upgraded to the 18-135mm lens instead of the 18-55mm
canon software a nightmare. im sticking to computer photo software on a mac instead.
lots to take in for a beginner, but that's my fault - not the cameras!
as i have the camera only a short time  i have nothing bad to say about it at this moment in  time.
poor manual - buy the dummies book!
not yet
the serious wildlife photographer may be alarmed at the shutter noise.  i  bought a canon camera as i was lead to believe that it has one of the quietest shutters.  out in the field i felt embarrassed because, while the other dslr's whispered, the 600d shouted.
if you wanna take some good pictures you must change the lens, not as good as the reviews say, especially in dark conditions, generally i thought this camera would be better in dark conditions but it isn't.
the rotating screen does not do a full 360 and i nearly broke it. bar that i cant fault it.
price, although canon is a very good make and i chose this camera over the other competitors it was a hard pill to swallow (although would make the same decision again)
would be nice if it had a full sized sensor
ef-s 18-55mm will not be sufficient after a short while.
a little complicated at first
will take a while to learn how to use all the features, but will be worth it
nothing yet!
kitt lens.
not really a bad point but if i had to choose now i would probably get a 60d not a 600d, simply because if the faster fps and more alround build quality.
may get some unfocused shots untill one learns how to use the camer correctly
autofocus during shooting video.
no auto-focus function whilst recording hd video, have to focus manually and the lens noise is picked up on the microphone ruining the sound.
hasn't got me laid yet but i'm working on it
there isnt much in the manuel about anything actually in the programming of the camera
size, weight, pre selection of scenes,
sometimes the pull out screen gets in the way, but easily fixed by closing it when taking a photo
have a little doubt about how long the battery lasts but i haven't really tested it fully yet and now i think about it i did use the video quite a few times for the first day trip which i presumes uses a lot of power and it didn't run out of power in about 6 hrs use
i have not found
there are not so importent if you are not a professional photographer .
that great big manual, to long winded.
ill let you know when i find a bad point!
viewfinder difficult to view through, needs an extender.
genuine canon accessories are very expensive.
as with most manuals it is a little daunting. even a little scary! there are plenty of other apps/books that make it a lot clearer. more on a step by step basis which is great for novices like me.
plastic feel to camera
some programs are a bit complicated for the novice photographer
there was no start-up manual with the camera, the supply of a 'disk only' manual requires the installation and printing or scrolling of the pdf file. this is not a convenient way of getting started with a new camera.
the shape, a bit too many rounded off corners for my liking, and insufficient grip. it feels a bit toylike in the hand.
lens rattles but works ok
don't know of any yet.
no automatic focusing (af) when in video mode, but this can be corrected by turning off af, and using in manual mode.
if your not experienced in photography, i imagine the array of buttons and features could be a bit mind melting at first
no constant focus in hd video mode...but i guess it's not a camcorder!
slow fucosing in live view. nothing at the ptice
the problem i can see so far is that the neck strap is coming in the way of the side of the screen when i shoot, so some suggestion is can it have the neck strap attached to the left at the bottom and on the right it can stay as it is, in fact i put my old hand strap of my canon powershot a610 because i have problems in it, i have been using it for more than 8 years now.
no issues
can be a touch heavy, especially when used with a battery pack. not as previously stated elsewhere (can't remember where i saw it) not the type you would carry around for a chance picture. when you are carrying this it shows you are out to take photographs. doesn't come with a record card as standard.
haven't found any yet! but if you're shooting with the pop up flash and you have a shallow canon lens hood on you get a bit of shadow on the subject, but that's not a fault with the camera.
nails tend to scratch the hard plastic body(minor issue)
not any
not found yet...
i'm still over the moom with this product haven't come across a bad point yet!
erm... maybe the size? but this is basically he standard size for all slr cameras. it's an amazing camera.
automatic focus does not work on close ups with the zoom lens
lens is ok but has poor performance towards zoom end of range, vignetting and light rings appear on the photos, also prone to lens flare.
navigating menus takes a while to get use to. slow to write to sd card, (may be down to to the 'class' of card i have though). no other issues.
lens can be expensive
havent come across any yet
can't think of any
as i'm still playing with the camera and getting used to all the features , so far haven't found any.
nothing so far, as only just purchased the camera.
takes some time to get used too, i'm a beginner
plastic cage
a lot of onboard processing - could live without ambience settings etc.  surely most dslr users edit on a computer?  macro mode has too shallow depth focus.  am concerned how long hinge will last but hopefully no problem
there is no mention of having to buy a memory card. very annoying to find you cannot use the camera immediately
i put it in my bag once and left a few white marks over the body of the camera
expensive compared to some other brands
no a/f on video. but not a big issue
you do need spare batteries .but not really a problem as they are not to expensive.
nothing apparent.
takes a bit of getting used to
that was a let down.
build plasticky but solid. perhaps a bit sub standard despite the low price.
not for amateurs
the manual gives instructions for the i s lens only.
finding a good case to keep it in
nothing
havent found them yet
the only way i could fault it is that the lens cap is a little fiddly and the lens on the 18-55 kit lens is a little foreward and is a little prone to raindrops and fingermarks. these are very minor problems though and a little care soon eliminates them.
removal of battery for charging
rather complex. it will take a long time to understand all of its features.
nothing to complain, thank you.
canon didn't allow the \xa330 winter discount
am a little worried about the flip out screen, so will mostly use it in situ eg not flipped out.
to much plastic
autofocus in video mode would be nice.
you will defiantly need to buy a better lens than the kit one.
record limit on video (12mins)
nothing so far
a bit plasticy..
need to get a more powerful telephoto lens or a doubler
haven't found any yet
- focusing on telephoto lens take ages... its quicker to do it manually... but on the end of the day this is rather amateur product than pro so overall i'm more than happy to have it!!!
this is on the bulky side so would not recommend using as a camera for everyday snap shot's.
telephoto lens is not a everyday or frequent use lens for me. would be nice to have slightly more spacious bag to fit in xtra lens .
havn't found any yet
the carry case is supposed to carry 4lenses and two bodies. maybe houdini could get them in but i certainly can't
the plastic housing looks and feels cheap for the price.
need to use it as instruction book is daunting.
lens cap never seems to fit just right,same on my last canon but not a big issue.
feels a bit 'plasticky'
takes a while to master all functions
lacking in some areas of settings and features but these can be found in the higher end canon cameras
i'm a little disappointed that to use the wifi feature i need to buy an eye-fi sdcard.
grip not as good as i hoped.
no bad points
not had the camera long enough to say.
can't fine any cons
neither lens has image stabilisation so images can be blurred at times.
can be a little complicated but once you reed the manual all becomes clear (read manual guys)
like all dslr more complicated to learn than traditional point and shoot, but this is not really a v]bad point, just a standard issue with dslr's.
very minor points though.
nothing about the camera, i just wish the lenses were a little cheaper
there are't any
nothing i have discovered so far
in store, i do not see the benefit of this method of marketing.
quite bulky so needs a shoulder bag to carry everything around together and therefore isn't particularly light when everything is in one bag!
not experienced any yet.
book a bit complicated.
soft wear a bit complex - still waiting for \xa330 cash back from canon
lens cap was lost in 2wks needs a string/ lead attachment to camera
my old sigma lenses don't appear to be compatible with this new camera.  that has taken the shine off the purchase.
lenses incorrect
cannot use in adverse weather
0
kit lens works well but feels a little plasticy
needs patience to work your way through the manual - a lot of back tracking to find what you are looking for.
to the shot meaning you may miss the moment, but overall the quality of the majority of shots makes this feature worthwhile.
can be a little frustrating using the more complex features, but this is probably more to do with putting the time in to learning.
cant think of any
the manual is overwhelming and i am still trying to figure out all the things i can do with the camera.  a video with easy examples would help.
non so far.
lots to read if you want to use all the bell and whistles
cost of accessories ie extra lenses
level. booklet should be more plainly written for people new to digital photography.
i cannot see any bad points at present but do not forsee any arising.
i am struggling to even think of 1 bad point. for me there arn't any.
somewhat plasticky in the build quality, but this is only a slight quibble.
at the moment no bad pointsv
nothing
hanot found any so far
the battery does not last more than 5 hours to record video.so you need to have at least 2 extra batteries to record for half of a day.
not much to complain about apart from the fact i noticed how nice the 5d that i tried recently felt in comparison - however, this is a much more expensive camera.  for the money, a no-brainer!
haven't found any yet
would have been nice if a lens hood had been provided for the kit lens
it's going to take me sometime to get through the manual and all the additional functions.
live view not great in auto focus lens keeps hunting for focus use manual, bit to plasticy
no instruction book supplied although it is easy to download a copy butnit is not that helpful for a novice (i have found eos 600d for dummies an essential buy)
it is bulky (maybe dslr cameras are really like that but it is not heavy).  i wish it's not black.. :)
battery was poor quality, bought another which is fine.
you need an external memory card before you take a picture so beware to have one ready for when it arrives but this is normal and this kind of camera
it lighter than some good in one but bad that is it good for quality
price and built.
symbols quite small and hard to read
light in weight
can not think of any.
can't think of any bad points.
standard lense is a bit small.
slow focus and continous shooting in live view mode.
build quality could be better.
lens
bid expensive
cant think.
hard to use, but persistent is key!
no bad points
originally provided witha case that was too small but this was immediately rectified with an appropriate replacement at no further cost.
compared to other cameras, the sensor size is quite undersized
no panorama shots
not really in a position to comment on bad points with it being my first dslr so can't compare with any other model etc
autofocus when recording video. wireless photo share.
not a metal body
rather a lot to take in, but that's because i'm old! i can't really think of any bad points - it's much better than other digital cameras that i have owned.
battery life!!
viewfinder too small: poor manual
i find i have to go far back to get subjects in as the head or feet can be cut of easily. also nighttime pics outside of house are very dark.i find it hard to find manual settings easily and quickly. maybe you can help. but i really like the camera itself. thank you
tried hard but can't really come up with anything except it is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for
annoying that you can't set the default manual exposure mode.
the number of features and how to access them will take a while to learn, but you can literally point and shoot in full auto and get very impressive results.
night shot? is there one?
not found any yet!
haven't found any.
a camera of this price should be supplied with a manual, not a disc.
viewfinder is weak
needs a screen cover when not in use.
cover for photo downloading port is fiddly and looks fragile. may not last long.
face detect focussing is not always perfect. would have liked more manual control ie shutter speed / aperture settings.
low light performance could be improved.
not so easy as some to use the special preset features
manual rather 'involved'
on/off button in awkward position
shoddy doors into download and battery compartments
view finder could be better
expensive, larger than other compact cameras, and occasional shadowing on the upper extremities of images taken indoor with flash
takes a little while to familiarise yourself with the many excellent features.
quality of night photos not brilliant.
in built flash rather weak
just the fact that to charge the battery, you have to take it of the camera and on to the docking station. which means carrying a spare if you are going to be taking loads of pictures is a necessity
obviously because its a 10mp camera, it eats in to the memory card alot, so chose your shots/videos wisely, buy a large memory card or change to a lower mp when taking pics/lower quality when taking videos.
close focussing could be better. menus and instructions very complex if all the possibilities of the camera are to be utilised.  detailed instruction are on dvd and thus are inconvenient to use in the field. a book would have been much more useful.
have not found any yet. still discovering it
fuji will be the winner.
features are difficult to use
no detailed manual
w, or change image quality is quite hard to use as it's not obvious where everything is.
perhaps could be supplied with a lsrger memory chip
a minor improvement would be smaller or little lighter ( but this is a quibble)  not a bad point  i'm a girl and these things matter in tiny hand bags and small pockets.
it drives me nuts that when i am viewing a photograph after having taken it, if i tilt the camera at all  (to left or right) the picture then rotates with the movement - it's probably a great design feature but personally annoys me!
no manual shutter or aperture settings.
the only minus was the memory card supplied ..... 6 pics and it was full ......................
picture quality won't compare to a dslr, but then you'd have to spend \xa3200+ on a compact for this to be true.
would be much more helpful if came with a instution manual !
for individual pictures - i will be very cautious in the future to avoid this happening again.
can only have the multi shoot function on the manual setting, and takes a while sometimes to take the pic. for example, i play rugby and my girlfriend wanted to take some pictures, every time she tried to do so i was out fo the frame before it took it. so i taught her to half-press on the area to focus, then press fully to take the shot straight-away. i would have like to to have a sports mode so it takes the pic as soon as you press the button.
some of the instructions are not terribly clear
increasing loss of picture clarity with zoom facility, especially with video.
slow picture taking
casing marks with fingerprints too easy
hard to navigate the menu
no soft case included
just the price but you get what you pay for.
i've had this camera for several months and so far i cannot fault it.
had to read the manual quite thoroughly to understand how to play back pictures, not quite as simple as on some other cameras where i have had a thumbwheel to move from one picture to the next.  (thats why it gets 9 instead of 10 for ease of use).
tamron lens does not have an image stabiliser so is very difficult to use at 300 zoom
i haven't found any as yet...
the only bad point with the kit i bought is the tamron 70-300 zoom that came bundled with it. even if you stop the lens down the image at 300mm is not very sharp plus in many lighting situations there is a lot of purple fringing. ok this is a cheap lens but i was hoping for results that were at least usable. i guess i need to save up for a 'proper' long telephoto.
haven't found any yet. oh yes, i keep getting the urge to buy more lenses for it.
as yet i haven't any, instuctions are well written, but it will take some time to get used to all the features.
i have no serious problems; i think it is a very good value for money.  some problems when managing white balance and exposure, the camera sometimes can\x92t get it right 1st time , but this is compensated by the large amount of options available and good use of them.
focus in live view
i wish it was cheaper..............but it is compared to other dslr's
lens that comes with camera is very limiting, so would recommend upgrading - tamron that came with the bundle is great.
terminal cover, flimsy
lack of the big scroll wheel featured on the next series up (40d, 50d, etc) makes quickly scanning through stored shots a little cumbersome.
a tad expensive.
dslr cameras are like a virus !  you'll soon be selling everything and remortgaging the house to buy more and more accsesseries, beware the moon!!!
the tamron lens hood is difficult to attach and detach without turning the focus system against the motor if af is selected.
default sharpening setting is a little soft. this can be changed in-camera, or images can be sharpened easily later (using the dpp software that comes with the camera).
because the bundle came with a second lens i think a bag should have been included.
small camera bodies can be a disadvantage if you have large hands. i looked at nikon d80 which felt much heavier and larger in the hand which gave it a feel of quality.
the tamron 300mm lense the camera came with was not fantastic, save up and get a 300mm canon lense instead, you wont be dissapointed
not bad point really for a novice like me, it takes some time to get the best of the camera.   it's part of getting a sophisticated camera such as 450d after using digital snapshot items.
flash charge time after repeated use.
shame that the tamron lens does not feature image stabilisation.
live view shooting, not a bad point, but better results are obtained by using the 450d in slr mode.  an excelent dslr canera overall.
i wish the standard lens was alittle better
complicated to use 'live view' mode
1.6 x 1 ratio means slightly less quality in images than you would get with the full 1 x 1 ratio.
just a tad 'plasticky'. good weight, though - just prefer a stronger body.
cant think of any other than it is bulky after moving from compacts
can't really think of any
the only thing i thought was not very good was the fact that their was no protective covering for the screen
difficult to use.
lens not compatible with my eos 5d
wanted video function not featured on this camera but that model was inferior for picture taking
would have liked one lower iso setting. really needs an external flash for indoor pictures
havent really come across any yet.
found it difficult to understand operational instructions, not possible to trim pictures on camera.
dont like the neck strap and lack of hand strap which might seem pointless but is reassuring!
user input required to tweak picture quality settings taht may need to be carried out rather than excellent photos straight out of the box.
why can't we have all canon lenses in these bundles? i like to have all-canon products.
instruction manual could be better put together as mine is falling apart.
would be nice to be able to use live view in all modes
only thing i've found so far that's a bit disappointing is the 450d badge on the bottom left of the camera has come off
could be cheaper
colour saturation can be a little disappointing, some of the features are hidden in the menu system
image stabilising lens not as good as the standard lens from the 400d
not bad points
i'm not to happy with the quality of photos taken using the auto settings.
can prove difficult to focus in low light
slight tendency to under exposure on full auto
takes a while to get used to where everything is and what it does (not really a bad point)
nothing major. would be nicer if the battery were charged when camera is plugged into computer, maybe.
no bag for slr or lens
i have to say i havent come across any!!!
cheap lenses but that was all i could afford being a student.
the only thing it doesn't do which some may want is to allow you to use the lcd screen rather than view finder when taking a picture.
colour reproduction is dull.
not found any yet
nothing
camera strap is uncomfortable around neck
havnt found any
possibly too small and lightweight
not found any yet.
high price at entry of product.
image stabilization on the tamron lens would make zoom shots in overcast weather easier. but for the bundle price lack of is is understandable.
haven't found any yet!
not found any yet.
no bad points
it takes it bit of reading to identify all functions on the camera (for a novice).
haven't found any yet
in between them, which can be awkward for shooting indoor pictures at a middle distance.
finding through all the extras i.e lux level settings tungsten halogen mode and so on also the auto focus can be hard word when the piture is has alot of background
a specialised cloth to clean the screen would be helpful.
keep having to wipe the screen it seems to attract prints and
i've not yet found anything any particularly bad points.  it does seem a pity, though, that the lens caps are not tethered.
cant find any
haven't found any yet! it would have been really nice if the offer had included a bag.
the manual fucusing takes some getting used too
the large lcd is hard to protect from scratching when out and about. a minor niggle
at moment haven't found any bad points.
not found any yet!
i've not yet found much use for the tamron lens, possibly due to my lack of experience or knowledge. as someone new to slr cameras i would just go with the standard lens if i was choosing again.
as with all slrs size
i can't think of any
havent found any yet
wanted video function not featured on this camera but that model was inferior for picture taking
difficult to use.
just a tad 'plasticky'. good weight, though - just prefer a stronger body.
battery life quite short with alcaline batteries ,great battery life using ni-mh 2800ma batteries
some buttons are awkard to use and a number of features are not easily accessible but need the push of multiple buttons several times to select the required setting.
you need decent batteries for this one.  i got some 2500's and they are doing me well..  normal 600's got chewed within a couple of hours..
lens cover not attached
sometimes you can catch the function buttons below and right of the viewfinder.
feels heavy
-also would of liked more devices too be able too connect too the camera like light gun for night shooting
some noise at high iso, but fine until 200. no manual settings in video mode. lens could be a tad brighter at middle and long focal length.
as yet i have not found any bad points
i am a bit concerned about the picture quality but have not had enough time to experiment with the different modes and features, so could be my lack of knowledge in using it properly.
slightly heavy
a little expensive for a bridge camera
minor point, but i would prefer a proper user guide manual, instead of the cd version.
a complex product if you really want to use it in depth which will require quite a bit of study.  a paper manual would be helpful.
nothing bad about the camera but
a bit pricey even with the relative low price on simply electronics , certainly would not pay full list price .
very short battery life, especially when using the lcd.
slow response at lower ambient light levels, has caused me to miss shots.    a custom leather case would be a much better option than the cloth fabric case offered.
the manual is on a cd but it would be better to have a manual in paper form included to check operation points while out and about.
little fiddly  to change settings,
does not come with a cover or protective bag
flush.  you can switch on using the easier 'playback' button.  this immediately shows your last photo and you can easily scroll back, but pressing the shutter button half way brings the lens out and you can shoot as usual.  but you still have to switch off with the awkward on/off button.  the video function is quite good but... i have not found a way of keeping the focus in operation, so it starts off sharp then loses focus if the subject moves in or out.  if video is important to you, there is another ixus model (cheaper) which has hd. it might manage auto focus, but i have not checked.  the user guide is a reduced photocopy effort- not up to the standard of the rest of the product.  but it is readable and fairly thorough.
due to its compact architecture, the flash is a little close to the lens.  consequently when used with an underwater housing a shadow effect occure owards the lower right hand side of the image.  this can be eliminated with the use of a separate underwater strobe, a worthwile investment for any keen underwater photographer.  the digital zoom isn't worth using unless you have a very steady hand or tripod, as the noise created even in lower res shots can dramatically reduce the quality of the image.  vga movie recording rather than high definition has its drawbacks (although the camera was launched in october 2008, and technology has moved on.  hd isn't the be-all and end-all in fact i've heard that people need to reduce the number of frames per second in order to playback many hd movies shot on cameras as their frame rate exceeds current dvd playback speeds.)
the round switch tends to flick to other settings easily so you have to double check before taking a photo.
it's quite difficult to get perfect focus when using the 'macro' setting to photograph very small objects. it seems to work best if you position the red dot from the camera's led beam slightly in front of what you want to photograph. once you get the autofocus right though the image quality is excellent. it's sometimes difficult to know whether you have successfully switched off the flash, as both 'on' and 'off' symbols are very similar and very small. the combination of zoom and macro seems to throw the autofocus out slightly. it's better to move the camera closer to the subject.
over complex, non intuitive menus, diddly and poor quality photocopied instructions obviosly a grey import - not made clear on simply's website
need to read up on how to use the many many options.
image noise
instructions came on a cd, but photocopy booklet was included. no case.
pictures display vingetting (dark corners). delayed reaction when pressing the shutter - even if pre-focussed. pictures seem to lack sparkle and most are improved by 'auto correction' on a pc. digital zoom (only) on video gives unacceptable results. the viewfinder is not very clear and does not show the whole of the image. menu navigation is not intuitive (to me). lens cover 'leaves' do not close flat every time.
the dials are a but fidly and the menus take a bit of working out, if you've had a canon before it only takes 10 minutes with the manual and you can see where all the more advanced settings are.
user guide is only on cd.- no hard copy supplied or available from canon. it will take you a while to learn all that this camera can do.
may be a little heavy
no bad points
i did find it a little difficulty with the zoom button placement as it tended to take  a little time for me to control it at the zoom distance i wanted. perhaps it was just me as i was so used to to my other digital being very  precise and better placed on the back away from the shooting position button.
the shutter firing.
would have been nice to bundle with a case.
comes with a cd manual - would have prefered a book.
if using the flask and the underwater housing a shadow is produced by the lens extension 'tube'.. i will need to buy an external strobe.
for a high end compact camera from canon it is very disappointing.  far too slow to focus/take and process the image.  the moment is missed most times. image is not very sharp considering this is a 15 mp camera.  i don't think it is any better than a cheap casio or samsung, certainly much inferior to the panasonic lumix which is less expensive.  i will not be keeping this - a waste of money.  i already have a canon digital slr and was expecting almost as good quality
feels like a toy?
not found one yet
batteries could last a bit longer but with two sets of quality re-chargeable more than enough.
therefore easy to lose.
really need to be able to manually zoom the lens
would have liked a book with how to use the camera instead of having to download off the computer.
the dial is hard to use to move between the scenery settings - it takes some getting used to.
needs a standard screw thread on the end of the lens to take filters (uv, polariser, cokin filters etc).
a bit heavy. resolution of viewfinder could be better.
a little bit difficut to hold, you have to watch out for your fingers blocking and activeting control buttons
although not bad, could do with improvements on image and colour quality and automatic exposure compensation.
no raw file format.
not a great image through viewfinder.
haven't found any as yet
on the whole nothing to grumble about.
you are not supplied with a case, you must buy this seperate added to this the strap for the camera is not up to the quality of the camera
image stops in view finder too long.  i can miss the next shot!
shame cannon didn't spot these simple flaws -spoils an otherwise great camera
if you are inclined to use auto setting only, you may be disappointed. i find myself using the program mode and + 2/3 exposure as i find auto pictures a bit dark.
the lens cap is easily lost. the menus are a bit confusing (or is it the manual).
this camera is not small, it's much bigger and heavier than my previous camera the sx110 and a lot of that bulk is consumed by the gargantuan lens and zoon function.  it can be held easily in the average hand but you will normaly need 2 hands for taking shots.  you will need a proper camera bag - don't be tempted to try and fit this in a handbag!  the stated batttery life in my experience is nowhere near 340 shots, it nearer to 250 but maybe that was becasue i was playing so much with the features and the zoom.  the viewfinder, although it has manual focus adjustment is not very good against the competition.
there are a lot of features on this camera.  it would have been good to have a printed copy of the whole handbook for quick reference when using it, rather than have to use the pdf on a computer.
battery life could be a bit better but used for photography of aviation so using the zoom a lot.
non
bad high iso image quality, counterpart of the small sensor.
not very happy with the camera and wish we had not purchased it.
not noticed any as yet
didn't come with any memory or memory card, so couldn't use straight away.
creates alot of noise at a slow shutter speed... tripod essential..
smaller viewing screen than other current cameras
on/off button is poorly designed. cannot find it by feel alone. taking photos of animals can be problematic unless you learn how to skip through menu quickly enough for pet shots otherwise a blurred image results.
it's difficult to list the bad points because i'm so pleased with the camera. if i was to mention thing it would be the size of the circular control button, it's small, but i do have big hands! you get used to it after a short while, like the buttons on a new and unfamiliar phone.
please note that i list all these points being as critical as i can. i would still buy this camera dispite them all. and still recommend it to anyone after a great quality ultra compact. if you want better quality, then go look at larger things that won't fit in your pocket.
because of the small size and flush rear buttons its can be difficult to change settings or view pictures unless you have child size fingers.
night shots seem to come up with blobbly aura bits (as though there's dust on the lens... i'm sure it's because i've not got to grips with the settings yet but it does this on auto mode as well...
having to remove the battery to charge is a real let down. having used the canon ixus i7zoom which had a docking station for both charging and transfer of photos, this camera seems a little lacking. the camera window software seems to have regressed as it has less features than previous versions.
it's got no wide angle - loads of close up shots you just cant get when out with friends in a group. the lens isn't wide enough so you have to step back which means you miss anything spontaneous
seems more flimsy than my ixus 70
sometimes but slow with taking the photo if the camera feels to close or light problems, the camera will take time to automatically adjust (e.g- macro) and then will take the photo fine. i havn't found it myself, dont know if anyone else has? but you cant seem to keep flash on for every photo, the camera will decide whether it has flash or not, and i really like to have flash on most of the time.
i have the black one, and the only negative thing i can say is that it is difficult to see the controls on the back of the camera when taking photo's in dark surroundings. ie on a night out...
have not found any
eyepiece is very small
on/off button too small and recessed.
paint scratches easily
would have liked a case cover that would fit over outer case like an ipod to stop it getting scratched as dont like bulky full cover cases so keeping the beautiful gold colour on show and saving time getting out of pocket so as not to miss a picture opertunity
small button not good for fat fingers.
doesn't come with a case so had to buy one separately......shame.
had to read the manual quite intensively to work out many of the features.
even with a fast memory card there is still an annoying delay before the next picture can be taken
poor auto focus in low light, colour balance sometimes wrong
and thats really why i've given it such a low score, because night shots are the thing that's hard to perfect in a point and shoot camera.
the flash and general indoor and night photos are appalling, painfully slow autofocus
not any i have come across.
haven't found any yet
some photo image quality not as i expected- somore reference to manual quide required
taking pics when it is dark can be a little tricky as the controls on the back are so small, that said, i still love the camera.
so small you could missplace it!
it's so small that you might find it hard to use if you have large fingers!
havent found any yet,only small niggle it will not charge from computer
pricey
autofocus little bit slow
viewfinder is very small!
service from simply electronics, which was exceptionally poor and slow.
image quality was disappointing
too small for my father's hands.wahehehe
hd-video takes up surprisingly much space on your computer. 12m is a bit over the top for standard family pictures. not good for pictures of kids because time from pressing the button till picture is taken is long compared to slr.
haven't found any yet!!
optical zoom is on the small size.
because it is so compact some of the controls need delicate fingers
the camera case  - the leather is very hard and the fasteners does not always work!  camera strap could do with something to make it adjustable to fit my wrist so it doesn't slip off!  i had to tie a knot in it!
battery/card cover seems rather flimsy
some controls are a bit fiddly for easy/rapid use
i've not found any yet!!
need to keep changing setting for image distance as the setting you set reverts to normal when you switch off. as with akk digital screens is hard to see in bright sunshine, one of the reasons i purchased the camera was for the viewfinder.
viewfinder image is small, understandable in such a small package. at least it does have one.
battery dies in cold weather ( especially skiing )
only a minor point, however button size takes a little bit of getting used too
hd movies are in a format that can be difficult to play - without a top-of-the-range computer the video playback on windows is poor (stutters) or audio is not synchronised. this is not a fault of the camera - the hd video files created (.mov) are high quality and intact, you just need a high-quality media player to play them! try gom on a high-performance pc.  i play them back on the wdtv media player connected to my hdtv via hdmi after first converting the audio using the mov2avi utility.
a little bit expensive, camera didn't come with even a basic memory card
should come with a carry case, had to buy my own spearately
the scenes cover most common things but there's no 'sport' mode, and no way of manually setting shutter speed or aperture.
it is so portable and would be much more so with its own belt pouch.
only 3x optical zoom - but i realize this is a tradeoff between capability and size.
can't really think of any!!!
being compact, it is easy to cover sensors when operating
couple of pictures came out blurry, but i think that was due to photographer rather than kit.
the only problem i have is that the movie files are not saved as .mpegs. i  haven't worked out ow to view them on my computer yet.
the menu control buttons maybe alittle too small for mansized figures.
can't say i have come across any bad points!
i would like a greater zoom range - sometimes but not at the cost of making it bigger and heavier
the black finish wears off quickly and the lens is noisy
can't really think of any.
you must make sure you have a big memory card for this camera as it uses a lot of space for pics.  the downloading of photos to pc is easy but sorting photos into folders  takes a bit of thinking about.
software not as intuitive to use as previous ixus model but may improve with familiarity
i haven't found any yet.
gold finsh can rub off with use.
plastics used arent great
some parts on camera such as the hd connection cover and battery cover can be easily broken if not careful
instruction booklet extremely poor
strangely enough, the buttons are more easier to manipulate when the camera is in the underwater housing.
i don't know yet about any bad point. the only thing i know is that i videoed  a bit and my card was full so quick. i thought the card was 4gb. my nephew will check it and let me know whether i filmed too much.
battery life
not the best picture quality, but good for what i wanted it for. nothing too flash, a general fun point and shoot.
costs too much .. you can get many other cameras with similar features for ~\xa3100
cannot believe that i had to purchase a memory card.  until i did i could not take any pictures.
the back coating on the camera has started to come of quicker than expected. some images taken in low light are not clear on auto setting
can't think of one.
a little bit slippery so i'm afraid of dropping it.
bit expensive
i have not been able to get rid of the date which appears on the photos and is not always wanted.  can you advise how to correct this?
the 'getting started' manual was far too basic and the manuals disk for use with the computer was far too inconvenient for me to use, so my son downloaded and printed the much larger 'camera user guide' which was a lot more use to me. i haven't yet found any bad points with the camera.
on off button to awkward.view finder to small.difficult to hold needs a case..
no raw mode (though cannot expect it for this price). continuous shooting mode has a delay between shots.
lots to learn on how to operate all the features. small instruction booklet but full information on cd. would like to be able to keep flash turned off for some photos but when you turn camera off and then on again the flash is automatically on.
when zooming in pictures become blurred.
apart from that its great little pocket camera.
controls might be a bit too small for someone with large hands, it may actually be 'too small' for some people.
zoom and flash
being very small it is rather fiddly. that said i would buy it again.
wish it were easier to find a case that matches it perfectly. the one that i got free with my camera (swordfish) is great colour and of course, great quality, but just a little bit too big...
some images come out a bit more blurred than with other cameras and pictures take slightly longer to take.
the lid that closes the battery is fiddlely when closed.
haven't found any yet!
control buttons are quite small.
haven't found any yet
it is too small and fiddily! also it is too complicated with lots of functions i can't imagine you would ever use. bring back the brownie127!
not found any yet
buttons a bit too small so sometimes difficult to press.
can be a little finicky to use as buttons are small, but hey its a small camera.
the instruction book was in italian an the only english version was a soft copy.
the only negatives i could mention is that if you wanted to use all the features of the camera, due to it's small size, the buttons are obviously very small so will be a tad fiddly. but in reality that is not what this camera is about, it takes good quality pictures without the need change settings for conditions. if that's what you want, this is the camera for you.
buttons rather too small and difficult to operate.
no manual mode, just simply point and shot, nothing else
not enough optical zoom but given the size of the camera this is to be expected. usb charging would have been nice.
build quality of the connection and memory card covers.
take a bid of getting use to the featurs.
a manual focus would still be useful every once in a while.
the viewfinder is good but it would be better if not quite as close to the edge of the body.
slightly disappointed with the quality but it is a small camera.
haven't found any yet!
i would have preferred a 5x optical zoom instead of 3x. this camera would have been the very perfect choice.
didn't come with case.
should come with a case really and you have to download/look at user manuals from a disk.
limited zoom
didn t come with a case
takes a lot of learning to to sucessfully use all programmes, but this would apply only to amateurs.
optical viewer could be better
can't zoom whilst recording video
the image screen rotation does not work if the camera is at an angle. it only works when the camera is perfectly vertical.
i was missing a sd card as part of the purchase but it seems to be standard that these are not included with the camera. would be nice to have a kit with sd card so one is ready to shoot with the camera right out of the box.
the buttons are a bit small but with a tiny camera that is to be expected - i am glad i have stopped biting my nails!
complicated menu
slow shutter speed.
lens fairly narrow-angle
only 3x zoom
noisy pics with auto (anything above iso 100). i guess too many pixels for such a tiny optic coupled with trying to balance this out during processing causes this noise.
zoom tricky to use even with small fingers
zoom not smooth, making it impossible to get an exact framing - except by luck.
a bit noisy.
fireworks setting produces really weird visual effects.  for night time shots, pixels go down to 3mp.  flash fires automatically on every setting unless you remember to cancel it.
no view finder
not known yet:)
nothing really to report.
cost
no under water filter
i was so disappointed regarding the quality of the images, as if it is not canon !!
no printed user manual and no case.
specification.
night shoots.
it dosn't have a eye level viewfinder
slightly on the expensive side
a bit complicated for the wife at first
price mainly
cant think of any bad points
no viewfinder.  makes a bit of a noise when it is constantly alterating focus.
no view finder - call me old school
slightly bigger and heavier than others in this genre
sometimes when you take the picture it come out blurred, you have to focus it well first
menu takes a little getting used to but to be honest it does everything automatically so not really an issue!
cant find any - superb camera
trivial point perhaps but i think the camera of this class and quality should come with a case!
expensive for what it is.
should come with some rudimentary slip-case.
buttons too big. always in the way. heavy camera.
woudl prefer it to have a proper viewfinder
expensive for a point and shoot camera.
no viewfinder, but not really required with the large screen
shuts off when cf card door opens - annoying
i need to save up for a good lens to do the camera justice
at first thought this was an expensive purchase but in using it for 2 months its worth every penny.
takes a long time to understand and get to grips with, taking shots can take a lot of setup time.
built in flash seems to under expose abit
lots of features mean lots of buttons - bewildering to begin with, but a thick book to help.
cannot fault it.
no anti-dust. no image stabilisor (not a problem if vr lenses are used though).
i had to exchange the camera as there was hot and dead pixels on the censor but the new one works perfectly fine :)
packaged software is not very comprehensive.  new sd cards can be lost down the couch!
a few buttons scattered around the body.
worry about dust on the chips, but this would be with any dslr.
not found any yet.
fairly bulky and heavy.
can take ages to photograph a detailed shot - whether you've got noise reduction on or off, and whether you're in landscape or auto modes. you can't preview the shot on the lcd screen, so you have to use the viewfinder, and there's no way to turn off the shutter noise which makes it impractical for photographing conference speakers, for instance.
if i had more money i'd buy the 5d or if i won the lottery i'd buy the 1ds
i like the body of my old d70, the d80 is a smaller body which is suprising  with all the added extra features
lack of anti-dust facilities as per d60 or canon. apart from that nothing (taking price into account).
beware of slightest  knock have damaged the digital display
in some creative modes you can become a bit lost off with what all the dials do, but a quick look through the manual will put you back on track.
memory card access lid is easily flipped open by mistake. focus confirmation indicated by small round dot in the bottom left of the viewfinder making it harder to see at a glance whether you are in focus.
can't really think of anything except maybe a bit pricey and ocassionaly the autofocus goes a bit crazy -- but that's probably user error!
instruction book isn't the world's best read!  having two command dials takes some getting used to.
not found any yet
should include a case at this price.
the 17-85 lens does sometimes show purple fringing in areas of high contrast e.g. tree branches against a fairly white sky.
there is a tendency to overexposure on sunny days resulting in loss of detail, so you have to stop back a bit; this is more marked with the nikon 50-200 mm lens than the signa 28-50 mm.
nothing yet..........
over exposes by at least 1 stop on auto, so have to use on manual all the time.
kit lens leaves a lot to be desired, but in view of the cost i really can't complain!
the camera is fairly heavy so lenses with image stabilisation would be a good idea although they can be expensive.
has many features and so takes some time to learn to use.
on/off switch a bit fiddly.
poor battery life compared to the d70
the kit lens has poor glass, and it took four different tries before we found a 30d that didn't have dust caked on the ccd.
very fiddly on / off switch
lots of window's to navigate for image setting, not ease to chance shot peramitors between shoots, no need for portriat, landscape etc setting on the feature wheel, could be use for other setting such as monocrome!
quite heavy
bit pricy at the moment
why did they move from cf to sd cards??
heavier than the 400d, some controls not that easy to understand
it's a little heavy but that's not always a bad thing
steep learning curve to get the best out of it
feels flimsy.
quite heavy,
still a high price
too many settings to explore quickly.
relatively slow 3fps burst rate
not found any as yet
price
the exposure adjustment can occasionally be accidentally be activated without realising it.
no macro
point), using the custom setting and storing a reading from a kodak 15% grey card in bright sunlight gave very good results.  nikon might like to look at why the auto setting is so different!
flash terminals exposed
very large
can't always tell if photo is in focus from screen image.
really nasty build with no features. generally poor picture quality
auto mode. i was disappointed by the number of photos where faces were underexposed. my brother had the cheaper canon equivalent and didn't seem to have nearly as many underexposed photos taken under same conditions.
quite heavy.
some of the sub menu's can take a while to get used to using
some users may need anti-shake facility!
light build
lcd sreen on rear goes invisible in bright sunshine.
lack of weather proofing, slower flash sync than d70/50, limited raw conversion software
left hand side of camera to small, does not enable a good grip .... really annoying as i can't get a good secure hold.
can be fiddly when trying to set menu features quickly
bit pricey
really miss the live preview tilt and swivel screen of the g5 for wild flower photos but only olympus slr has it at the moment.
grip is missing, may slip from hand if strap is not on. did put a grip in my camera under canon logo for safety. does not have hd video (don't have a real need for it at the moment).
expensive! however, not as pricey as a g11, and has the same sensor.
it's a bit on the pricey side.
there are few bad points such as the circular control on the back of the camera which can be moved accidentally when setting the rocker switch controls.  in the centre of all this is the function control wich is very small and needs care when operating it so that other switches are not altered. the cd which comes with the camera contains a very full instruction manual but has to be printed out as continual reference is necessary when first operating the camera. it would be helpful to have a full printed manual but that of course would add to the cost.
shame because otherwise, you can't fault this camera.
slippery smooth outer surface makes it easy to drop
i have also read reports that it is difficult to hold but i have no trouble. maybe its just the americans greasy fingers from all those fries!
operating buttons to unprotected to lock and inure functions.
focus is hit and miss, doesn't focus very well in macro. focus still a little suspect after firmware upgrade,may send back again..
nothing
small size means it's a bit tricky to use sometimes. not that good on auto mode (tends to use too high iso at expense of picture quality) really need to take more control with p, tv or av etc.  i set iso to 80 and use p mode. video quality only avi so not up to latest hd.
not a layman's product. need to learn how to use it
no optical viewfinder.  can be difficult to compose the picture in bright sun.
downside is i wouldn't like to drop it, the plastic case does look (though it could be) very durable.
i haven't managed to find a sport function so don't know what it'll be like when i'm trying to photograph a moving target. .when downloading images the software makes a new folder for each day's photos and doesn't allow you to choose where you want them to go.
lack of viewfinder
some controls a bit fiddly.
power supply could have been stronger.
the biggest draw-back with this is that it eats up batteries. it takes only 2 aas (my previous canon had 4) and even duracells lasted only a day or two on holiday. rechargables are obviously the ones to use with this model. also, when uploading the photos onto computer using the software provided, changing the target directory and generic image nameis very fiddly. the software with my previous canon allowed the user to change both directly from the import dialog.
small image sensor
have not found any yet
haven't discovered any so far.
need  rechargebl  baterys,  and  charger
a higehr spec card as a standard supply with the camera
a litle heavy on batteries
sometimes it can be a bit complicated
lots of features=--still learning to use them all.
not easy to see the image on the screen in sunlight, so taking photos can be a bit of a lottery - made worse by my photo-chromic glasses.  a little pull-out awning over the screen  might take care of this
would have liked a view finder as sometimes its difficult to see the image on the screen without getting a reflection.  a bit difficult to open battery compartment quickly !
fairly chunky
non
its awful. i would have returned it, but i pushed it aside for so long that i ran out of time.
only one. why does the flash pop up in good light whilst in automatic mode. i still havent figured out how to stop it. can anyone help.
live view is fiddly and not quick to focus. 20fps on hd video is sadly short of 30fsp, but its ok i guess? high asa settings negated by auto picture corrections (in custom functions), meaning limit on asa top settings. why on earth canon decided to put the video start/stop button separate to the shutter release i don't know!
i am still looking for...
reduction in resolution and contrast is noticeable compared to 5dii, but as it is less than a third of the price, this has to be taken into account.  personally i  would only use the 500d up iso800.
doesn't always present information in logical sequence. there are occasional instances of a lack of familiarity with standard english.
a bit flimsier than the 300d....  fingernails seem to mark the plastic near the handgrip quite easily.... only a cosmetic thing,  though.
lcd display is fixed in the back which restricts its use but is viewable at an angle which helps a bit but a fully articulated screen would have made the camera unbeatable at the price.
continuous shooting soon locks up.
live view limited to only certain modes.  autofocus not available in movie mode.
the battery life is not as good as previous models, and i'm not sure why the button for switching between metering modes has been relegated to a menu option. this is something that i use often, so this is slightly iritating.
no autofocus with movies
hfaveen't really found any!
i take alot of hdr photos and was hoping they would have included a 5-point bracketing feature by now. that is being really picky this is a great camera, especially for the price.
video is not easy to focus and not obvious how to use; still not sure whether the pictures are as sharp as they should be - possibly just getting used to the focusing.
battery life now much shorter due to power absorbed by stabiliser
in auto iso mode you cant set the highest iso value that you are comfortable with.
contiuos shooting is not always as quick as 3-4 frames per second.  video hd feature is not really worth it.
it will be replaced soon by the 550d !!
more megapixels than needed. better to fokus on image quality! live view is a dissapointment, due to difficult and slow autofokus!
money wise a bit over the top
auto focus in vid\xe9o mode could be better.
hd record is fiddly - could be made simpler
it has a plastic feeling on some parts of the body.
havent found any yet
can't use 'live view' in the basic zone shooting modes.  a hinged lcd monitor screen would have been nice.
it's not a canon eos 7d.
expensive initial purchase, batteries and storage cards from older models are often no use.
there are already electrical faults relating to focussing points
does not balance well for timed shots, some sort of mini tripod needed
not many bad points! really beats the competition and for the price you really cant go wrong. only one point i would like to make to canon is that is hasnt got an otical view finder, which i sometimes prefer and also would have saved on battery life due to not having to have screen on all the time. apart from this everything is perfect.
we bought a case with the camera to match the body.  unfortunately the case is a shade of blue which is good for girls, but not blokes if you know what i mean.
only thing i have noticed is that sometimes there is a red line on the led screen - don't know if i should be worried about this but it only occurs occasionaly and disappears again.
8 on image quality), though that might be due to only standard auto settings i use, as i tend to prefer the point-and-shoot. more features/functions might be more fun, though for the cost it is a good selection.
in low light quality the image quality suffers a little. however, with a more thorough understanding of the camera features this can probably be overcome.
switch between modes is plastic and is the only weak element
so far have no bad comments
didnt get memory card or case ???????????????????????
didnt recieve camera case or 2gb memory card
would like a small strap to prevent dropping
i did not receive a free case or 2gb card with my camera
i didn't receive a 2gb memory card ! x
free case and gb card never arrived.
i didn't receive any free case or 2gb memory card
not sure the quality of the kit lens is a match for the quality of the camera. i'm a little disappointed at the results indoors, where i thought the dslr would really shine over my little fuji, but there isn't that much difference. i'm considering splashing out on a better lens (as i saved several hundreds of pounds against the 7d), such as the 1.4 50mm, or even the 'cheapy' 1.8 50mm - which i hope will generate even better results, especially of portraits of my family.
finding a good memory card that can handle the hd video speed - i bought a new samsung 16gb sdhc class 6 card (550d (canon) said the card had to be a minimum class 6) the card worked great for stills but was not fast enough for video. i have now purchased a transcend 16gb class 10 sdhc - internet reviews indicate this card can handle the video so lets wait and see, in short check the cards are proven to handle hd video in 550d before purchase just any old class 6 card may not work!
the canon 550d does not have a swing out lcd viewing screen which makes low level photography difficult, unless you buy an additional viewing screen.
shame the rear screen doesnt come with a screen protector, but thats easily rectified with aftermarket ones available
the battery and memory card are not interchangeable with the 400d but are of superior quality, otherwise i can't fault the product.
mode it's slower than i expected for still images because the mirror has to lift out of the way so i don't use that feature except when shooting video.
(portrait, landscape etc) ones
also when shooting using the built in mic you get the noises of the lense and focusing picked up in the film.
what am i to do, now, with the darkroom ?
not sure i have found one yet.
i have found no bad points as yet.
intensive instruction booklet. would recommend slightly larger type face is used. canon accessories are very expensive compared to the compatible stuff like lenses.
not enough zoom for me, but that's the matter of the lens
the on-body lenses are very expensive and can cost as much as the camera did for the mid-range models.  i wish the kit lens had a longer zoom length as this is something i really miss from my old camera.
still trying to find one!
i recommend purchasing the canon ef-s 55-250mm is telephoto lens, as the ef-s 18-55mm is kit lens is only suitable for portrait and wide-angle shots.  the built-in flash is also not great (but this is the same with all dslrs), and you might want to purchase a separate flash unit.
i can't think of any, its a fab camera in the price range. the kit lens is a bit limiting but most people have/buy other lens to go with it.
a bit penny pinching making the hmdi cable an extra.
the battery life is ok, but if you are going out or away and expect to use it heavily probably worth getting a second one.
several times i have knocked the program dial when switching the camera on and off. the dial seems a bit too easy to turn in this respect and i have found myself shooting in manual instead of  av. maybe it's me being clumsy but wonder if anyone else has noticed this.
- haven't found any so far
could come with memory card although you could purchase one at same time
why did canon name the same camera in different country. 550d in uk and t-rebel for usa. it just confusing for us amateur whos looking for a descent dslr.
however, i also use a 55-250 mm is lens and focusing at the telephoto end might be a liitle slow for just point an shoot- which i assume is expected i suppose.
not cheaper - a bit below the belt but that would be the only bad point in my book.
the kit lens is nothing special.
not much... you get what you pay for.
nothing so far.
in a quiet location when useing the movie function, turning the 18mm to 55mm lens for zooming does make a slight rubbing noise witch is picked up by the in built microphone.
not found anything yet
i can't fault a camera within the price bracket that i have paid that has all the functionality that it has. it is clearly a technological marvel that 10 years ago would have been unthinkable at 10 times the price paid
having said that the video quality is fantastic.
nothing major, canon have got it right!
the kit lens it quite poor, and lets the rest of the camera down. i only bought this with the kit lens as a stop gap so that i could get used to the camera and until i could purchase a better lens (i now have the 17-55mm f2.8 - fabulous!)

build quality is ok but slightly plasticky. overall feels like it can take the odd knock or two. much better builder quality than 1100d.
built quality. but no, don't imagine that it's made out of cocacola bottle, like i did before i took it to my hands. the worst thing about the built quality to me is probably main dial's, reduce/magnify buttons and maybe (not sure) even shutter button quality. talking about the video mode, well there's no continuous af during filming and the mic catches every little noise from the camera itself, like manual focusing. but all these flaws comes to a body/it's built quality. note that i couldn't find any cons in picture/video quality or camera performance.
a little on the expensive side.
should come with a memory card.
supplied lense is the only setback.
video autofocus will be a good to have but not a big issue as such.
/
the lens that came with it is very basic..thats why i bought a better lens
lens supplied not so good considering the price of the camera
sometimes complicated to find the exact feature that you want.
me and my inexperience - i want to learn all it can do but it can do so much! i'll get there though.
would recommend paying the extra for the 18-118mm lens but it is at a premium
the instructions that came with it were not as full or as helpful as they might have been. it took me longer than i would have wished to learn how to use the lense to good effect. but i have managed to do this now.
so far i did not found anything to be a bad point
nothing
doesn't come with a memory card in the box! as far as i could tell you have to have one as the camera has no internal memory!!
although the 18-55 lens image quality is good, the lens could do with having a greater telephoto range.  so a longer focal length zoom (say a 75-300) is a definite additional purchase.
accessories are very expenisve
before the video function ( may be i don't use the video function with the best method: i learn) for me the video is only some time. it's not a camera movies.
as a pro i don't really need the video facility. some of my images are trunciated so i am not sure if there is a fault on the camera. a bit flimsy compared to pro cameras. would like to have kept aperture and shutter control on separate wheels, the jumping between buttons  is slow and a nuisance. the battery door is also very flimsy and has come off on a number of occasions. the card has jammed a few times as well.
the manual you have to plough through - but it's worth it as it allows you to utilise all the cameras features.
auto focus can be a bit tricky
battery doesnt last very long really, always handy to have a screen that swivels but you need to pay more for that luxury
nothing bad about this camera.
can't think of one.
it's a bit heavy, but no more so than any slr with a similar lens
the 18-55 lense that it comes with isn't very good in all conditions i.e. inindoors, especially for hd video recording.
should come with a uv filter. the lcd needs protecting.
no bad points about the camera,
cannot think of any!
feels a little lightweight and plastic compared to other cameras in the range.
non as of yet
.....
screen (glass) above lcd scratched easily
not been used enough yet to comment
not found any yet!
video autofocus is cumbersome
i was disappointed with all the little extras you have buy like memmory cards and a cable from camera to tv, the 18-55mm lens was ok , but now i'm considering a lens with better zoom
drop it and you'll break it.
not found any.
haven't found any yet.
i would be nice to have a memory card supplied as part of the camera package.
accessories are expensive
i haven't really used it enough yet but one thing that does annoy me is that if you are using some of the different modes like close-ip, it doesn't seem possible to turn off the flash which is really annoying.
nothing yet
body is plastic and feels cheap.  expensive for the quality of the body
haven't found one yet but then i'm mainly using it in auto mode just now.
nothing wrong with the product, but a few extra accessories would be nice (bag, extra battery)
i have'nt foiund any bad points as yet
there is no memory card included (not even a small one for a few token photos) - i gave this to my husband as a birthday gift but we were unable to take any photographs of the celebrations . . .
isn't that what a camera is for ?
bulky
no bad points
bit costly
missing the paper manual and was missing the cameras battery which i am still awaiting. emma from the company has been helpful to date but i am still awaiting a battery and the manual since 22/01/12 when i ordered the camera. hopefully these matters can be resolved so i can test the camera.
still trying to find one.
i can not think of one
cannot believe not supplied with lens hood, most cameras come with a lens hood. 1080hp movie mode is fantastic but uses so much memory  12mins of filming will use about 4gb.
it has no bluetooth
lens small zoom but i just have to buy a bigger lens, simples.
0
not a 100% viewfinder
high price
non i could thuink of
could do with a better zoom
- also the lens you get in the bundle isn't great, but once you buy a slightly more expensive lens there isn't really anything to complain about.
not a bad point but a wish that perhaps you could offer a left handed version! find it slightly awkward to focus with my right hand....but getting better with practice
the build quality doesn't feel excellent to me, also the prices aren't what id call truly reflective for a mid-range dslr.
not found any yet! :)
assimilation des r\xe9glages de tous les param\xe8tres. cela semble un peu complexe, mais s'applique bien avec un peu de logique.
automatic settings are poor, manual mode is teh way to go (as with all dslrs)
nothing major but the lens bayonet is plastic but acceptable due to the price
nothing
menu system is a bit complex and slightly intimidating for a beginner
havent found any bad points as of yet
the zoom is not that great if you want to take shots of something in the distance. i'd recommend buying a larger lens in addition (and its worth spending a bit extra for an is lens).
i had the misfortune to drop my camera only 4 days after recieving it and although it was in a camera bag, the front piece below the flash broke off and the flash is smashed. i can only use the cameras with high iso until i can get an external flash or try to get it fixed.
could have come with a small case but just came on it own.
the nly thing i can thing of is the lens cap is not attached to the camera when removed
haven't found any yet
manual is very difficult for a raw beginner
flap over connection doesn't look like it'll last long.
sometimes the auto focus can take a while and if there is not enough lighting, it occasionally refuses to take a photograph but i am sure i will find a setting that prevents this.
difficult to get the best images possible, bad auto-focus
i am just the beginner - novice user.  there are more than enough features for me.
tad expensive.
did not realise i had to buy memory card in addition.
18-135 lense should have better definition but could not afford the 24-105 professional lense at 800 euro
the auto focusing can sometimes take long and decides not to take the photograph.
sometimes depending on lighting the camera takes a while to focus and you can miss your window of capturing a picture, but im sure with more superior lenses its even better.
aucun
it doesn't come with a memory card which means you can't use it straight away. also unless you have a good knowledge of real photography, you will need a book to help with fully utilising the camera.
cost!
price has decreased a lot since before xmas
to do that you'll need to buy a decent prime lense. when you see the output from that combination, it will put a smile on your face.
not so much a bad point but more  a sign of how much a novice i am, it is less than intuitive to find some of the settings and quite often you have to trog through menus to find what it is you wish to adjust. it is expensive and hence not as good value for money as it might have been, particularly with the 600d coming onto the market - i did consider this but prefer the weight and features of the 60d.
it is a plastic body, which while still robust, is not as reassuring as a magnesium body which i am used to. if you want a magnesium alloy body, buy yourself the 7d
nothing but i've a lot to learn with this new camera.
these are really quite minor issues though, the camera is still an amazing bit of kit, possibly not worth upgrading from a similar or recent model but from a 20d, oh yes, do it, now.
can't decide which lens to get next.
its very heavy
magnesium alloy body would have been nicer
the funtion button need to push just can scroll it,too bad.
i think they could of splashed out a bit more on the lens cover!
a bit heavy and bulky, but if it wasn't then it wouldn't be so versatile.
body light weight

the menus on this camera are slightly confusing when you first use them.
flip out screen - cant get used to it.
still looking
the only issue i had was that the canon menu display was in chinese, so i followed a youtube tutorial and a few clicks later it was in english.
to soon to mention any
wide angle setting on standard lens results in top corners being clipped off: not all of the viewfinder frame image can be used.
too many to list
does not feel quite as robust as previous model.
have not found any yet
no bad points
using live veiw takes some getting used to, it puts the mirror down to focus and then lifts it to take picture
haven't found any yet
3. an xlr input offering phantom power, not just a 3.5mm mic socket
lock on exposure setting control seems unnecessary but not a big problem.
lens ef-s 18-55mm is have poor build quality.
is is on the sensor not the camera
the charger will not work
despite this, a great camera!
small niggle re the popup flash being right under the position where i naturally want to put my left index finger when holding the camera.  in reality i'm getting used to this and you can keep your finger down holding the flash back - manual says this is ok.
i'm really struggling to find my way around the camera. this is partly due to still after 3 wks of owning it not having had a chance to go through the manual, and partly due to the number of features that lead you off in various directions as you play with them. but really if you're paying this much for a camera you need to invest the time in understanding the more detailed functions so i know i'll get there when i have a moment.
flash pops up atomatically every time you switch on.
minor niggle - have to view through rear screen - no visual viewfinder which can be difficult in certain circumstances.
on and off button a bit to small or in the wrong place, if you have long nails or big fingers its a bit of a struggle to turn it on, but thats all.
also, the camera does not feel very ergonomically comfortabe to hold.
dial to select scene option is irritating as very bulky - the options could have been done using a menu option
the camera is quite heavy compared to other compacts.
great zoom but wide angle is limited
a bit narrow to be held easily, and it's too easy to accidentally disable the flash by bumping it.
i can understand what people are saying about the flash on the camera, however it's so easy to adjust to! the flash doesn't have to be up all the time, obviously unless it is needed.
there isn't any really - the only thing is possibly - if you plan to take a few videos carry a spare battery as that really drains the battery.
although the screen is large, the image does not fill the screen so it might as well be smaller (i ordered it for the bigger screen!)  i also feel that this camera needs a viewfinder - used in bright light, it's quite difficult to see the screen.
only learning to move your finger off the flash when you turn it on, and really that is not difficult to do.
flash is located in top left hand corner which can be annoying as this is normally where i hold the camera
ummmmm.....................can't think of any yet!
on/off button small and awkward to operate for big hands. takes some time to get used to holding the camera without covering the flash when switching on.
the pop up flash takes some getting used to as it is just where you want to hold the camera.
flash a little annoying when turn on, finger stops it opening. but i knew this when i bought it, just takes getting used to.
the zoom button is a bit fiddly and the flash is in a bit of an inconvienient place but to be honest the good points far outweigh these small bad points
loading software for a camera is a bit of a nuisance!!
the bad points are the flash. every time i turn the camra on i leave my finger on the flash and it dosent pop up. i know i should not put my finger there but its when im holding the camra with my left hand and turning it on with my right it happens. and only with this camra.
i find menus somewhat confusin,but i suppose i`ll get used to them..as all previous reviews i`ve read,the flash is poorly positioned
camera is not easy to hold, or get a grip on, its very slim, shiny and slippery! the on/off bottom is so small it needs a fingernail to 'touch' it on/off and hard to find by touch; also the shoot button is not so easy to find by touch. camera good for young, nimble fingers, but not having those any more i would have preferred a camera that was more sturdy to hold when shooting, and buttons more clearly defined.
i'd perfer a better manual or dvd to teach me how to use the camera to its maximum.
the jessops own brand case that came with the bundle is a disaster because of the large velcro pad on it.  the hooks of the velcro embed themselves in the rather silky strap that comes with the camera and has almost destroyed it.  not a good design and i have had to remove the velcro.
w function would've been the icing on the cake :o)
havent found any yet!
i desperately want to buy the underwater housing.....however the advert promoting it implies that the housing is not waterproof!!!  i would appreciate advice please.
pop-up flash gets in the way
the zoom function is too small and fiddly.
having had a panasonic lumix, i find this model not as easy to use.  more difficult to delete photos, find the self timer mode, for example.
expensive.
the camera is not very good at night time ( if ur at a concert) if the room is dark with flashing lights. just doesn't focus very well
disappointed that no instruction manual was provided in english yet instruction manuals provided in finnish, swedish, danish. the camera came with a 3 pin uk style plug so why no instructions in english. it is a menace to have to refer to the english version online instead of having a handy booklet.
the manual could be better quality printing and paper for a digital camera in this price range and quality.
some of the dial combinations are not intuitive.  tendency to hold where pop-up flash is housed!
mode, rather than retaining the full picture view - very disappointing and very annoying.  i think the camera is somewhat overpriced for what it offers.  compared to the sx120 is, the sx210 is is sadly lacking and i would not recommend this particular camera.  the sx120 is is a far better camera and exceptionally good value for money.
the flash is definitely in the wrong place. you want to put your finger there when you hold the camera.
i knew about this prior to purchase.
can't find any!
the pop up flash which automatically pops up when turning camera on is situated on the top exactly where you hold the camera, it takes some getting used to.
i didn't find any and i hope i wont.
could do with more than one battery
no view finder
the hand strap seems very prone to snagging on the velcro parts of my lowepro pouch. even after a couple of snags it's not looking like it will keep its form for long and it's quite difficult to pull it off the velcro without causing any damage. but it's only a strap!
haven't found any yet
difficult to use sone features but this is purely because there are so many!
not exactly a bad pint but so many functions, i'm not sure i will get full use of them all.
battery doesn't last very long, buy a few spares!
anything above 400 iso is pretty unusable. manual settings are tricky, and manual flash power setting requires going into a menu - i've found myself using one of the auto scene modes for dark environments like bars and clubs. no 2-second review in anything but auto mode!! flash pops up right under where your left index finger naturally sits.
positioning of flash is a little bit awkward
slightly bulky, flash mode sometimes need to be switched on digitally and manually for it to work.
at the moment i have not found any bad points
i did not receive an english manual with my camera!!!!!!!! would appreciate one if they are aavailable
now the negatives, the biggest of which by far is the video quality, which is so poor as to be almost shockingly bad. maybe it's the bad, dull weather recently forcing the camera to select a high iso (you can't set it manually in video mode) but i've checked it over and over again to make sure it is actually on the hd setting (it is). colours are dull and lifeless, detail is simply non existent and both focus and exposure are all over the place: unless you or your subject are static, the focus spends longer than it should 'hunting' and auto exposure is set way too high, so everything looks over-bright and washed out. hd video was certainly not the main reason i bought this camera, but it was one of the influencing factors and the fact that it is all but unusable is very disappointing. battery power: i've taken around 160 shots so far (mostly photos + a few short videos) and the battery is now reading low - sometimes capacity increases after a few charge cycles and i can only hope that will happen here, as 160 shots is really not good. awkward to hold: i may just need to get more used to it, but the sleek design, big screen and pop up flash position doesn't leave much to comfortably hold on to.
nothing find.
flash in wrong place, want to hold camera on top of  flash.
yes, it's a bit pricey, but it is true that you get a lot for it.
on off switch abit fidley
price is high
no leather case for it.
little chunky but features make up for this.for my level of expertise(zero) too many features!!!
the camera takes a couple of seconds to confirm its auto-focus, so if you are too 'snap-happy' you can get some blurred pictures.
no sound on when using movie mode off and on button to small to use comfortably
although this camera features a big lcd display, the entirety of this big screen is not utilised the playback stills. the flash pops up when you power up the camera regardless of the ambient light level. the body of the camera looks very plasticy. this sort of minimizes the capability of such powerful camera.
where the flash pops up,can be a pain.
the position of the flash.
the flash is not that well designed
your finger always stop the flash lid raising , due to desighn
flash gets in the way.
can find it cheaper elswere
flash comes up automatically when you switch on but you can get round this by putting your finger over flash to stop it happening.
the only bad point is the lack of a manual.
tried it for the first time at a perty las weekend and found a lot of the shots to be overly bright (too much flash) and a lot of the shots were blurred, i do have other canon camera's and have never had this problem before.
on-off button is bit small so doesnt work at one go, bit heavy so needs careful handling, response time seems a bit slow i.e. you cant take 10 shots one after the other you have to be paitient set urself and then click, so that means you may not be able to capture sudden moments
place of flash
i either want to have full control of the settings or want the camera to do it for me if i am taking casual family pics. all the shooting options in between seem to over complicate and clutter the camera.
the outappearance of this camera is sort ot  different from i thought when i saw the picture from the web
badly positioned flash, could not hold camera comfortably. over vivid colours. zoom kept locking on to the wrong subject whilst on long zoom. very cheap covers for cable connection and battery. a lot of features are in sub, sub menus, frustrating when you want to point and shoot quickly.
slow at taking pictures
rechargeable battery
knot one bad point
nothing yet
flash pops up when turned on
flash is in a bad position,
the pop up flash is a bit of a pain - its position means you are forever preventing it opening by leaving your finger over it. the build quality is good - but it isnt stylish and a bit of a lumpy piece of kit when compared to similar and equally capable cameras. shame its only available in black as the look of it would be enhanced if it were available in silver.
think for the price that the camera should come with its own carry case.
still looking.
my previous sx110 was excellent for one handed shots - the sx210 is more difficult to handle single handedly. and the zoom lever was easier to operate on the 110. but smaller size and extra zoom make up for these
menu systems are fiddly and this is not helped by having two different systems to access different options.
little chance for operator input to select better settings.
where the flash is positioned
at present not able to identify how if at all possible one can take quick action shots as we can on our canon eos
flash popping up on start up is annoying but was aware of this before making my choice to purchase same.
not many but flash not in best position and not figured out how you can browse or skip through pictures without going through all of them!
would like a spare battery pack
when turning on my hand prevents the flash from coming on but you will get used to this and avoid this happening
wrong charger (eurpoean) but uk/ire power lead supplied
didn't actually receive my free case!!!
in my opinion i can only suggest one point and that is the position of the flash light,being placed where one would normally hold the camera.
the power cord was for non uk socket.
on full zoom it is difficult to hold steady. the pop-up flash is annoying.
only minor bad point is the pop up flash which takes some getting used to
image quality on full zoom
flash opens where you normally hold the camera which can take some getting used to.
but not really a bad point.
plug in port a bit flimsy, but i'm clutching at straws really... great product overall
not too sure about the flash.
the pop up flash is a bit of a pain every time you switch it on,gets in the way when you hold the camera
would lke to have seen mutiple image stitching
price a bit high
makes noises when tracker is on.....
-doesn't have basic features like making pictures black and white but other than that, its perfect
absolutely nothing!
you have to search around for the extra features on the camera if you wanted to use it for quick use and the continuous button doesn't take immediate shots.
there is no dedicated playback mode just a button to press which means that the lens is out while you are looking at pictures. my old camera you could playback with the lens retracted
should be fantastic if it had a manual focus mode.
slightly flimsy battery cover flap.
fiddly usb cover slot
battery and memory card cover and the cover over the interface connection appear to be flimsy - hope i am wrong.
only one colour to choose from...
haven't found any yet!
not found any yet
no manual override
battery is not for long time.
no optical view finder. could do with a lip around the screen to protect it when camera laid down. colours not as good as my old camera. same picture taken with both cameras, showed grass more yellow than green with canon. still acceptable though.
camera can switch on if not carried in a hard case.
the only thing i find difficult to come to terms with is the fact that you have to half press the button to focus and then press again to take the picture, (i do prefer the old fashioned cameras in this respect)  but this is the same for all digital cameras.  although i must say, i find that aspect easier with this camera than with others i have used.
case feels a little plasticky
charge is going fast..
picture quality not as good as expected. but i do normally use slr!
quality sometimes not so great in low light. not much warning when battery running out.
o
horrendous image quality, especially when there's limited light.
there are no bad points for this product
hesitation on flash triggering on distance photos
heavy, plain
when you upload pix's into pc image quality is not into the standard.
not found any as yet, but would have like a choice of colour
no zoom very basic
feels a bit flimsy
nothing!
havent found any yet.
only one - zoom limitations.   it is difficult to judge the amount of zoom to create the perfect composition.   i am guessing practice makes perfect!
the number of shots i was told the battery could take wasnt what it turned out to be. took less than 45shots within a week,and the battery went flat
the basic controls are in a getting started booklet, but the user guide is on cd which i don't find very useful, although the on screen text compensates.  this is my third powershot and the previous ones managed a user guide booklet.
the pictures do not compare with a 400 pound camera obviously and it is not as slim as some other compacts, but overall a good chioce for a point and shoot pocket camera with an optical viewfinder.
the batteries don't last long at all if you take lots of shots.  always have some spares with you ...
i don't think this camera has any bad points.
optical zoom not available once you are in video mode.
the battery/card department not always easy to open.
non really....
the instruction booklet is just a 'getting started' guide. the main instructions are on the disc. if like me you are not too hot on computers, you will struggle to find what you want. then when you are out taking pictures, you will think 'what did it say'?
view finder quite small takes time to get used to
card and battery compartment a little 'fiddly' to open (especially if trying to change them in a hurry).
can't think of any off-hand.
but nevertheless is something to watch out for. as such my review can only be based on my experience of two identical models - if picture quality was as expected i would have given the camera a high rating.
user manual in cd format. would prefer booklet included.
like all the point and shoot digital cameras i've used it is a bit too slow. taking shots of anything that's moving is a bit hit and miss due to the shutter delay. guess that's one of the reasons people buy expensive cameras though.
use of standard aa batteries is disappointing since they deplete rather quickly. we are now using rechargeable aa's.
instructions for use a little confusing.
i haven't found any yet.
slightly awkward for large hands!
plastic tripod socket.  some of the effects such as 'toy camera' are not very useful.  no case with it but it fits in your shirt pocket so you don't need one.
small range of settings, unless you know how to program it.
it's a bit bulky but that's the price to be paid for using aa batteries. there's probably some technogical reason for it, but if this camera could operate on aaa battries, it would be better.
it uses aa batteries which tend to make it comparatively heavy
the viewfinder is rather small and can be difficult to locate when you are in a rush to take the picture. also the field of view through the viewfinder is less than what is actually taken on the photo. this can be  annoyoing at times as a better picture would have resulted from the greater accuracy of the viewfinder, although obviuosly extraneous material can be edited out later.
aa batteries make it a bit more cumbersome than it need be
it uses batteries as if there was no tomorrow.
battery life. even with the best i can get it doesn't last a morning, even with out flash
have not found any so far
the reason i bought this is because i wanted a compact camera with an optical viewer. this is the only compact that has this feature i believe. it is useless and just shows that same image whether you are zooming or not. it also doesn't show any information - in fact it seems to be just a superficial extra that didn't actually do anything. this is the only part of the camera that was a dissapointment.
aperture control
quite heavy on batteries; using alkaline aas now since didn't find nimh batteries lasting without camera complaining. like many other cameras now, no doubt the plastic catch on the battery compartment will be a weak point ...
low light setting did not compensate for low light conditions. not much difference between different settings and auto. pictures not as good as my very old 3m pixel camera.
does feel quite plastic-ey and the battery compartment is quite difficult to close sometimes - quite easy to turn it on whilst doing this! it does feel like it (the battery door) could break very easily, wish this part was more substantial.
especially removing cover to access battery and memory card.
i found the focus frame(s) a bit confusing; the viewfinder is somewhat tiny.
no anti shake stabalizer
not a lot! it's cheap and cheerful and you get a fine little camera for your money.
would be better if the shutter button was on the outside of the mode button.
not found any yet
lens cover can be damaged easily, get a padded case asap
the downside of the batteries is that they seem to run down veru quickly....
would have preferred greater optical zoom
viewfinder is very small camera has to be held very close to eye makes framing shot a bit awkward
would have been nice to have had a case with it, but this is a minor problem as they are easier enough and cheaper enough to purchase.
runs on 2aa batteries which can run down quickly, particulary if using flash - would recommend 2 sets of rechargables and keep a spare set with the camera
care must be taken in poor light as focussing can be slow in these conditions.
as far as i can see, the video is only usable in landscape.
shame it didn't come with a memory card.
also it doesn't show on the screen that how much battery life is left/consumed.
see review for camera case - should have been for the camera
suffers from excessive shutter delay.
like most cameras in its class that take aa batteries it hasn't been designed to run on rechargeable ones. that doesn't mean it won't run on rechargeables, but it does show a low battery indicator from an early (if not initial) stage and when it finally refuses to work with the batteries you'll find that their charge is only part spent, so unless you have a smart charger that discharges them before charging them you'll be shorting their life. (i'm talking about nicad and nimh batteries; lithium's may be better.)
the functionality is basic compared to more up to date cameras.
battery life is low but i have bought some rechargeable 2500mah batteries and the problem appears solved.
haven't found any yet!
personally, i would have preferred a better hard copy manual rather than the disc
not so fast so need to hold it steady.
bit 'plasticy' - but then for the price :-)
too much info on screen?
it does have a clumsy plastic body.  i will need to set aside a lot of time to study the manual before i can take full advantage of all the features.
it has a lot of effects, so it takes a bit of time to figure everything out. would have liked this camera to be able to record sound when recording videos.
you have to change the batteries; i would have preferred it to be with a charger.
buttons too small and close together, not enough features, zoom slow to act
could work out expensive using normal batteries but i intend to use rechargeable batteries which i was informed were compatible.can't think of any other bad points....
optical zoom does not bring subjects as close as other compacts.
batteries run out quickly.
the viewfinder could be more accurate - only covers about 70% of the picture.
did not include memory card, but then, people can choose exactly which they want.
fiddly access to batteries, memory card and download connection.
the only real criticism is of the viewfinder, but a small one. being optical, it does not respond when using the zoom!! a bit of imagination helps, though
image in viewfinder when zoom used is not the same as appears as the picture, or via the monitor.
no bad points discovered yet!
slightly bulkier than a 'normal' pocket digital camera - but still fits in the same case so the difference is not marked.
i have to say that this is the second 1200 ,the first returned under guarantee because the electronic display went haywire.this did not put me off however.i would have liked a more compact battery system but then perhaps their bulk gives a more solid feel to the instrument.very little to dislike and a lot to like.
zoom ratio slightly low.
everything is marked with the lowest score. for example, the camera may have warranted a 7 for ease of use for the short time it worked, but ultimately, i couldn't use it at all. i would have scored overall rating as zero but that isn't an option. this was my third canon powershot but the first to fail.
horrible plastic exterior
can't use the camera memory card in my stand-alone usb card reader (to computer), so far. i need to investigate further.
could doo with a rechargeable battery
don't get it for great image quality
too much information appears on screen when to start with you just want to take pictures.
hand strap difficult to install.
viewfinder is very small
rechargeable batteries don't seem to last long before needing a recharge.
i have not found any yet.
non
.  i was expecting something better than my ageing samsung and i`not sure it really is.  overall a little dissappointing for a canon, even a cheap esat to use one
powered by batteries not li-ion
non-rechargeable batteries
instruction manuel on line and this needs to be printed out.
drains alkaline batteries too quickly.
could have more functions like black and white or maybe you can blur the back or the front of the image
not too happy about 'aa' batteries but at least the're cheap and easy to get.
no guide marks in the viewfinder to help correct alignment in close-ups.
on/off and shutter buttons not best placed and the openings for battery/card fiddly for less than perfectly agile fingers.
feels and looks a bit cheep
no case
the camera was bought to replace a brilliant canon powershot (with viewfinder) that was stolen.  the viewfinder is its bad point. i regard a viewfinder as essential for the many occassions when the screen cannot be properly seen.  the eyepiece for the viewfinder is too small and it is hard to frame a shot.  it is a pity that canon has effectively dropped the viewfinder as an essential part of compact cameras.
screen quality not brilliant. a bit plasticky
no selection of resolution; slow to fire shutter; loss of traditional powershot bulge for right hand means less comfortable to hold; shutter button slightly awkwardly positioned
without the instruction booklet, it is not clear which way round the batteries go in the battery compartment.
pastic body of camera is poor
disappointing battery life could do with li-on rather than aas
a present for someone else
lapse time is slow, but for a camera at this price you need to accept some compromise.
unfortunately shutter lag and shutter button needs getting used to if you have had other digital cameras.
too basic and bulky for those used to digital cameras.
very low image quality in low light withour flash
digital zoom limited
x4 zoom
not found any yet
no prtectve case
viewfinder small
auto focus is useless
plasticy
nothing as of yet.
shutter lag would make it less suitable for action.
how ever needs to come in more choices of colours :(
optical view finder not as good as a630
bit of a plasticy feel compared to my last sony camera, but got over that !!
optical viewfinder quite small
it doesn't have some of the snazzy colour options - but i don't need them.
the zoom is probably the week point, but it is still ok .
feels flimsy compared to their a480. battery cover looks like it won't last long.
battery life could be better and battery quite fiddly to replace. will definitely need to buy/carry a spare. cover for usb and mini hdmi sockets feels flimsy. pricey.
no hard copy manual.
cant really think of any.
battery cover a bit flimsy. menus not as intuitive as others i've used before
menu system takes a little getting used to.
you need to a memory card to start taking pictures apart from that i couldn't find any faults with it
auto focus can be a bit inaccurate but only while your getting use to the camera. also the shutter button and surround is plastic; asthetically metal would have looked and felt better but thats me being picky!
haven't found any yet!
feels a bit 'cheap' with plastic components.  cheaper nikon that this was replacing felt better in the hand but did not take pictures of the same quality.
as i only had it for a month, i may not have noticed everything but one thing i noticed is that it doesn't give me as good a grip in my hand compared to my previous canon powershot a710 is (that side of the camera is fairly smooth but not 'slippery' though...)
sound recording level from video is not all that good, but it was not bought for video use.
i find the menu really confusing and hard to work out. hubby hasn't had any problems though, so i think i just need to get used to it.
for the serious photographer this doesn't measure up to an slr or bridge camera, but for its size and price you'll struggle to beat it.
expensive for what you get
this model is slighly bigger and heavier than my old one, but this is mainly to compensate for the bigger screen.
it is too early to judge, but i do just wonder if it is really robust enough.
takes a long time to find and get used to and use the features.
manual / auto switch fiddly to use
in auto mode outside on a dull day i had to keep putting the flash on manually or photos were almost totally black even with the flash on the photos were not good
hard to discover/use some of the functions on the manual settings
would prefer to charge the battery within the camera rather than having to remove it but gin this is probably just becausey old camera worked in this way. i'll get used to it.
no user manual included.  it takes so much paper and ink to download it all and is bulky to store.  the old little manuals that used to come included with the camera were so useful and so much better.
if you are wanting a camera with a lot of manual controls then this is not the camera for you
i must say i dont think ive come across any
haven't found any.
doesnt feel as sturdy as previous ixus750
it came with a  2 pin continental   connector
because of the amount of features available the menu system, which is well thought out, can be quite extensive, if you want it to be - but you can just leave in auto mode for easy use. the buttons could be a little more pronounced to make this the perfect little point and shoot camera.
compared to my 5 year old ixus, i don't think the image quality has improved that much. it is good, no question, but i expected more to be honest.
slow start up time so not good for quick snaps
can't fault it, for the price
would have much preferred it to have a small hard copy of the users manual rather than having to download a number of a4 size pages which are not so easy to carry around.
limited instructions in pack but more available on- line.
not sure why it does not come with a card or carry bag to protect the rear screen as the cost of these would be minimal if provided with the camera
takes a little while to get used to changing from auto to manual to change settings.
the sound of the zooming action when recording video however this is only a minor issue.
broke within first week of use when dropped, screen immediately smashed, not very resilient
you will never get the same image quality on this kind of camera as my slr but still get to keep in your pocket.  again vidoe camera is not as good as a dedicated video camera
you do not want to put it away!
haven't found any yet - but i guess it's early days as it was a christmas present
battery life adequate but keep a charged replacement in reserve if you're out for any length of time. take extra care on the beach....small compact cameras and sand don't mix whatever the make. i always use a lens brush to keep it free from grit.
zoom a bit difficult to operate
the cover over the usb socket seems to have a rather flimsy anchor point.
haven't had it long enough to comment on durability/reliability
haven't found any yet
no bad points found so far
zoom button is a little difficult to control.
not good as i tought so.photos is not always clear,silly plastic parts,not very happy.
have not noticed any yet.
haven't found any yet
written manual could have been a little more comprehensive, rather than having to refer to the cd rom
having to refer to disc for anything other than basics
it struggled when taking photo's in a nightclub. it kept on switching to macro mode.
no bad points. photos not quite as good as my slr but  for general use excellent
don't think my next camera will be an ixus
the cable a little fiddly to insert, and the controls are meant for delicate fingers (but it is a tiny compact camera afterall)
can't think of any, love it.
non so far
not really a bad point but you often need to use pragram mode to get the best out of the camera but this is easy to use.
flimsy plastic cover for hdmi/av out ports.
i would have preferred a silver model but very few available. i am getting used to black though.
shutter noise seems louder than on my previous ixus and the shutter itself is more delicate  (this probably has some relevance to the shutter speed) and is easily moved if touched with finger when the shutter is closed, although quickly moves back to its resting position. i would recommend that the camera is always carried in a camera case as i would not trust the shutter to remain intact if put in a bag without protection.
cheap and flimsy plastic cover over the usb/hdmi sockets.
slightly complex menus if you decide to take more professional pictures
nothing yet
i wish it had a view finder, sometimes difficult to see images in bright sunshine.
comes without a memory card, so you can't start using the camera until you have one
- pop-up flash in awkward position, just where you naturally grip the camera
it has no internal memory so won't work without a memory card, but not really a bad point, just something to be aware of.
i do dislike only having the screen to look through.  in certain lights you can see nothing it appears really dark, and what you get is luck not judgement.
not very impressive image in low light conditions, flash pops out and this sometimes is a nuisance as you hold the camera to take pictures
as most compact camera, it struggles in the dark.
would be nice to have a viewfinder.
unexpectedly slow operation.
flash in a slightly awkward position but you just learn to work around it
could be better battery life.
as with all compacts the taking of photos by looking through the screen is still in my mind not as good as a view finder on an slr but ok.
not easy to get a safe grip when holding the camera to compose a shot.
instruction on the internet
as yet have found no bad points.
the controls could be more user friendly but this is a minor point.
no memory card included
haven't found any yet!
battery does not last long, i take loads of photographs so i purchased a spare.
be very careful if you take to the beach - sand is a killer.
battery life isn't great, but easily revolved with a spare battery.
no handbook is again very mean of canon. it seems that the battery life is on the short side. the buttons are small and fidley.the sound volume when replaying a video clip on the camera is very poor and nowhere near my old ixus960is.
easy to misplace due to small size - maybe canon could invent some tracing device to find it.
slightly slow shuter
recommend spare battery when taking lots of photographs on holiday
buttons quite small and fiddly, cant seem to find aperture priority on it , but for this price it does  brilliant job anyhow.
should have come with a case
battery cannot be charged in camera and spare batteries are expensive.
didn't get the camera !!!
i did not realise the camera did not include the memory card - it is the first camera i've ever bought that was not a complete package - i cannot use the camera to check it out under the return warranty until i can find the time to go shopping to purchase a memory card to fit.  if the camera is not a complete package it should be stressed in the product description so buyers are not caught out,
nothing
.
it takes a little while to work out how to get to the various scene modes.but i'm sure with practice it's easy. i preferred the button arrangement on my previous canon camera.
charging. you have to remove the battery and put it into a charging station that plugs into the socket.
the flash can be a ,little annoying.. but only slightly, i owned a ps sx200 and the flash on the ps sx260 is a vast improvement
position of pop up flash is a bit annoying as it sits under your index finger when i hold the camera.
battery did not last quite as long as i expected ans there was no warning that the battery was getting low .
extremely difficult viewing the screen in daylight.
a bit slow between pressing shutter and taking photo.
battery runs out too quickly and the  flash gets in the way .
only problem i am having is keeping my fingers out of the way of the pop up flash.  just got to learn to re-adjust my hold on the camera!
quite heavy for a small camera. my finger is always where the flash 'pops' up and so registers an error. will have to re-educate myself to hold the camera in a different place!
other than that fantastic.
camera
doesn't come with a case
takes some getting used to. i kept switching the flash on when i wanted to adjust the exposure or aperture
takes a few seconds to take a picture from the second you press the button.
the flash, when it pops up, can be a bit of a shock.
camera shake at full zoom
flash pops up just where the left hand holds the camera for steadying. very very very bad design fault.
i wasn't impressed by the picture quality. also, the flash is located where people normally rest their left finger(s) and it suddenly raises. unless you are familiar with the equipment you won't waste a shot. also a bit heavy.
- how! still not sure how flash works
battery life isn't spectacular.
auto settings don't produce sharp images
unfortunately my model suffered from zoom motor noise when using video and had to be returned.
as always why no hardback manual had to get this from a website and pay it wwas reasonable but the idea of usng a tablet or phone to flick for featuures is not good!
have had a few issues with some of the images reporting as corrupt but not sure if it is the camera or the user
impossible to reply to this questionnaire as the \xa310 voucher promised has yet to appear (after over a month and many phone calls)  we plan to buy an xd card with it, so up to now the camera remains useless.
flash is hidden in camera body under, where your finger is when holding the camera, when auto flash comes on the flash lifts your finger off the camera, nearly dropped it.
flash button pops up under where one holds it!
flash in the wrong place it hits your finger  if  you are not careful.
need to use prog mode to turn off flash
pop-up flash can be unexpected and annoying some times.
some features hard to find if you are not very intuitive. paper manual a great help.
not really a bad point, but if taking a large amount of photos in one day, it would be useful to have a second fully-charged battery.
pop up flash is located on top left of camera, so caution when holding camera - makes one jump.
no written instructions as to all the programmes available.
instructions only available on cd.
not intuitive
faces
if i hadn't bought it as a package with sd cards and case i would have had to have added things
difficult to keep my finger from covering the 'pop-up' flash. this prevents the flash from rising to its full height. this does not stop the flash from working.
i found the battery is sometimes hard to remove and the cover over the usb points a bit fiddly.
the flash is in an inconvenient place. it pops up where my finger is to hold the camera. i just have to remember to hold it a different way when i need the flash.
zoom good but you have to hold the camera very still, tricky to do.
like almost all cameras of this type, there is no viewfinder - whatever the manufacturers claim, this is a serious problem with strong sunlight behind you. a delkin shade helps. the option of raw would have been welcome.
quite heavy and bulky, feels like it's more made for shooting landscape than people (which i am more interested in so a biased view)
a lot of people have been complaining about the flash popping up where you finger sits naturally when taking a picture, newsflash, move your finger and it wont get in the way!!! the only point i will bring up is the picture quality at maximum zoom isn't as clear as i was expecting, i think a tripod might sort this problem out though.
no eye view-finder
fingers can get in the way when flash pops up!
not having a printed manual .
have not yet found any.
im'e too stupid to use all the features
position of pop up flash.
hard to understand what and how to  adjust for manual settings
flash difficult to disable / too easily re-enabled.
more expensive than some alternatives, but for a reason.
flash pop up isnt comfortable while holding the camera holding the camera.
no booklet only online. problem getting anorhher battery
not found any yet
case is bad design.
shape and place of the buttons is not very ergonomic.
it is expensive
battery does not last long
difficult to focus at maximum telephoto ie. 2o mm you have to use tripod.
flash gets in way of your finger
flash popping up where hand is.
flash pops up from the top
not so good for moving pictures
bigger than my previous camera and heavier, but nothing i cant get used to.
it did not come with a case and the instructions are all on the web instead of in book form.
autofocus in live view mode isn't great... regularly struggles if the scene isn't 'simple' and even when it is working - can hunt around for a good two seconds before finding focus - so just stick to using its instant live view autofocus
limited only by one's imagination
shutter sound
leadtimes for deliveries. almost one month for such a product at this price !!!
continuous shoot could be better
quite expensive
so many features it takes time to find and remember the ones to use
il y a une rayure dans le viseur
no paper user manual
lack of built in filter thread.
loss of variable screen over earlier models, but understand the compromises made.
parallax error through the view finder
menu's can be tricky to navigate without the manual
view finder dont show any information
a disadvantage of the fast lens is that it is reluctant to use flash when i want it to, but i will just have to play with the settings.  the box included a cd with a manual, but only in chinese!  however it is easy enough to find the pdf on the internet.
not compatible with other g series components
manual flash keeps catching me out as my g9 flash was auto.
grip good be better not much to hold on to, still it is a compact
still expensive. got mine cheaper as next model just out but it was a stretch
colour balance in certain artificial light situations could be easier to get right. sometimes menus not intuitive. no sd card provided.
not had it long enough to find any yet.
if you want a point and shoot camera don't bother. this can do that but you will miss the opportunity to take control and be creative.
can't think of any
the movie frame rate should be switchable between 25fps uk system to 30fps american system
you have a buy a separate book as no manual but no big deal bought an excellent guide for \xa315
not as good as the g12 because it does not have the directional viewing screen.
it was delivered with out a paper manual! im sure its a very good camera but its difficult to figure out with out a paper manual.
as above
even if this compact is the best i found, still the quality of the pictures are far from slr (d800)
non
haven't found anything yet. only small point is that the charging plug on my camera is a bit micky mouse. it comes as a multi plug option which i think may be because the camera isnt from uk stock.
fiddly controls
does not include a wrist strap.
poor optical viewfinder
optical viewfinder.
-
quite heavy.
no hard copy manual
haven't really found any yet - sorry, but it's just a fab happy snapper.
the elv only extends through the optical zoom range.  initially, i found  the menu complicated ( i'm a slow learner ) but i'm learning. the auto and p settings are excellent if needed.
perhaps a little on the heavy side for a compact camera but that is a very minor complaint.
price
no information in oprtical viewfinder gives this limited value and i haven't used it as much as i expected - perhaps an evf would be better in the next model.
i have not yet discovered any
don\xb4t know yet but the cover for lens seems pretty thin so carry case would be recommended to protect cover from taking hits.
no paper manual - it is hopeless to have to consult the computer every time you want to check how to do something.  this is a big minus.00
fairly bulky.  not a particularly long zoom.
view finder is vital for me, so better if at least some information is shown in it.
no printed manual
only drawback is power button...... it sits exactly where i rest my index finger when not shooting..... inconvenient but manageable.
5 x zoom against the previous g9 i owned which had 6 x
pushing it into a tight pocket can accidentally rotate some of the dials on top, so when you pull it out to take a quick shot expecting it to be on  'auto' it may be on portrait, and the exposure compensation on +2 for example.  not a major issue, but check before you shoot.
manual focus point
view finder too small should be rectangular.
big
internal flash seems a little weak/underpowered.
heavy
having so many dials and modes takes getting used to before being able to use the camera effectively.
le viseur , pas de porte filtre sur l'objectif
no manual only a cd very frustrating to a new photographer
we heard something and difficult to get out
lack of functions in video mode, lens noise when zooming in video mode, no microphone input
this particular kit does not have the image stabilised lens (which is why it is a bit cheaper)
but i suppose some economies needed to be made to keep price down. the instruction manual is printed in very small type face and is not the easiest manual i have ever read, however there are pleanty of online tutorials.
cant think of any
night shots are good , wont say excellent.
camera is bulky, however, i knew this when i purchased it! i also felt a little intimidated with all it's buttons etc, however, i brought myself a dummies guide to eos 1100d. lastly, again this is no fault to the camera directly, however, be warned once you buy a product of this kind you do end up buying 'extras' battery, sd card, which all adds up!
sporty photo shoots can't be done properly with this. although shutter speed is good but motion detection is not that much good. hence photo becomes blurry. night potrait system has same problem.
lens has some silver strip between the moving parts which is peeling loose. had to superglue that badboy back in! also, sometimes trouble with auto-focusing in very low light.
only 720p video.
not found any yet
looking at the design, i'm sure canon could have made the lcd screen larger. these are only niggles!!
no bad points, apart from its an older model might have a few difficulties selling it off later on when upgrading to another model
can't think of any.
makes you want to spendall your cash on lenses
i will have to buy a lens cap that i can attach to the camera as the lens cap on this camera doesn't have a string attachment and i keep dropping it from force of habit! that is the only drawback i have come across!
has a plasticy feel but doesn't distract from use.
i would like a carrying case to come with it.
quite heavy
auto focus sometimes doesn't work properly
the lcd screen is a tiny bit on the small side.
no bad points just yet!
would prefer if the lens cap was attached to the camera as it has been misplaced on more than one occasion.
you can get some cheap lens of ebay to get you started like i did
quite a light weight build.
autofocus in liveview, battery...... :(
the features are great so it is a bit pointless if you only intend to use the auto function.
compared to the more expensive canons it feels a little bit plastic, but not to bad
no comment.
no carry case
n-o-n-e
no bad points about this product.
battery charge could be better.
struggling to find any apart from lack of full hd video, but if like me you are happy to live without it a very good buy
unable to change colours on the camera itself (eg, to black and white).
haven't found any yet.
cant reduce pixels at camera level
limited zoom means having to buy additional lense straight away
the shutter is loud, not an issue for most things but can be for wildlife shots.
objectif trop limit\xe9
fault after 4 - 5 days unable to resolve
hard to find protective bag to put camera in.
interface isn't overly intuitive. going 'back' for instance within a menu isn't easy..
don't like smooth finish could be made to look more leather like
haven't found any yet
no camera case
for the price
memory card included
can't find any till this moment.
change between single and multi shot is a bit slow
see above!
where i bought it from
only 12 megapixels, but the pictures still look good, but haven't printed any yet though
it is hard to turn on some features. the menu takes a while to get used to and is not totally intuitive at times.
daunting amount of indicators on display if trying out manual operations.  feels a bit weighty.  can be a bit noisy when taking a shot (clacking sound) particularly when in a theatre!
i haven't really found anything i'd identify as a 'bad point', although i accept what some reviewers have said about the camera maybe feeling a little 'plasticky' (sic0 in build.  but so far that hasn't worried me.
havent found any yet
the kit lens is good for the initial pics but soon you'll be after a 'proper' one! consider buying wihout any lens and buying a better one from the outset.
non i have found up to now.
noe
a bit on the expensive side, but considering you are getting video (*.mov format) at 1080p for up to 29.59min max at one shot, its a lot better than carrying around two cameras
pay attention to full card: i have lost all my pictures because when the card is full, the camera can't read the card and want the user to reformat the card...just don't full the card!
would have expected such an expensive piece of hardware to have at least a soft case for initial protection as well as a small memory card so ot could be used straight out of the box, neither of which were provided
haven't found any
not encountered any yet.
video mode picks up lens focus noise and there is no provision for an external microphone.  this can be overcome by investing in a canon ultrasonic lens - a costly solution...
my canon 300 400 all use cf memory cards for which i own a number of high quality rather expensive cf memory cards.  now i have to start over again to purchase high quality sdhc/sd memory cards.  the quality of the basic kit lens (18-55mm) is well below the expected quality of a canon lens.  the slower frame rate to achieve hd video.  lack of an external mike output.
standard lens has some color abaration on edges, can fix in processing
kit lens is very light and plasticy with average image quality.
kit zoom very mediocre quality - have bought cheap 50mm 1.8 lens and results are far superior.
some features are not adequately explained on screen (and don't have an obvious effect) so reference must be made to the manual.
battery does not last long before requiring recharge
shutter sound a little loud for wildlife shots.
1080p hd slow frame rate - ok for landscapes but 720p better for moving objects. better still buy a canon dedicated hd video camera
cant think of any bad points at all. i've had the camera for 3 weeks and enjoyed every shot!
should not be considered as an alternative to a movie camera as its facilities to shoot hd movie are limited.
no bad points
i haven't found any so far.
no dvd tutorial available to help you master the controls,and give you confidence to progress.
i would of preferred more easier control options in the menu, although in auto its self explanitory, having a few extr settings like on the sony a330 would of been nice
haven't found any yet. the only slightly negative commetn to make would be that the camera didn't come with a memory card and you cannot take images without one.
can't find any yet.
can't think of any.have always been a huge fan of canon!
cropped sensor, but as are all models in this range so this point should not be a problem, lens end rotates when focussing, so no fade filter can be used easily, this can all be done easier in post anyway.
bit confusing at first, getting on to jpg instead of raw, but once done, no problems
video and live mode focussing is slow.
why dont camera manufactures supply cards?even a 1gb would get you started.
the white balance and iso settings in full automatic mode do not always give the best results. better used in programme ae mode than auto.
haven't found any yet
no card included and standard lens gives good quality pictures but feels a bit cheep.
kit lens build quality is not great, but certainly adequate.
non
the lens fitted on the camera package however is fairly limited so i intend purchasing a telephoto lens at a later date.
currently still a tad pricey
the mode dial. need to get rid of the easy modes and just have the pasm modes.
the lens it comes with is not fantastic so i would recommend anyone buying this to get a bigger lens with the pack when they buy it.  the shutter function is also quite noisy but these ar small points for an excellent camera
sometimes buffers a bit so can't take another pic quickly
video mode isn't great (only 20fps at 1080p)
no movable screen(can't adjust the screen)
the grip could be a little bigger, it's a little unconfortable to hold it due to it's size. the functions could be more easily adjustadble with more dials.
video not doing autofocus
has only 9 af points against 11 in nikon d5000
basic lenses ar ok but can be soft at full aperture. don't think camera would survive knock - quite plasticy.
price but i always wish things were cheaper!
did not encounter any yet
can't think of any at the moment
instruction manual not very clear in one or two places. some of the switches/buttons are very small
may be over-complicated for beginners
can't find any for the moment.
plastic body- could be more robust
the price is too high.
in past have had difficulties with damp getting into canon cameras-hence need to replace
more plasticy appearance and feel compared with my eos 300 35mm camera
i miss the 'extra' features avaliable on the powershot cameras...
not found any as yet!
feel about it but no problems with the build quality so far.
camera bag is coming unstiched on front pocket even though hardly anything put in there
should have small individual fitted case with it a standard.
nothing
0
n/a
still learning about it, but haven't discovered any problems yet.  canon reduced the rrp a couple of weeks after i bought the camera!
on off switch very small
not found any yet.
the supplied strap is covered with logos (thats a bit of a personal bugbear) and not the most comfortable thing on the neck.
rear screen much improved though still difficult to see in bright light - hoped it would be better.
it is'nt free.
on/off switch difficult when mounted on a tripod
takes some time to learn the more specialised features.  will probably still be learning in 12 months time
haven't found any yet.
can't think of any.
the video option is missing
not found any yet.
a little heavy but that's about it
on off switch looks a bit flimsy.
as i expected it is heavier and have therefore had to invest in a new sturdier bag to carry it and my equipment over a period of time. i expected this though and do not see it being a problem.
non really
heavy....but you get what you pay for
cannot find any
perhaps could have easier access to some of the menus and facilities
had to buy compact flash cards as my 450d used sd's, no big problem though
non
on far to many times i find that this dial has moved, and now have to check every time that the setting has not been moved...................very poor showing here canon
, people who want this should buy a simlple compact.
haven't found any.
not enough time to use it
non e so far
digital noise very poor on relatively low iso
takes a bit of getting used to in order to get the best from it
- fiddly on/off switch.
no
still doesnt take sd cards
graining  at high iso levels is slightly worse then what i expected, although  can be easely compensated with adobe lightroom
lack of movie mode may be a problem for some.
my flash not working !!!
not so keen on where the on off switch is - prefer it to be more accessible - but that's the only negative thing i can say so far
no bad points.
as yet, i haven't a great deal of negativity to share with you all. i thought it might take a while to get to know all the features and therefore not get any good pics but this is not the case.
can be a little bit noisey at high iso, but this is fixable by exposing correctly and is quite easily remedied is photoshop.
more things to learn!
nothing son far
the on/off switch is awkward to use.
can be a bit confusing.
hd video may not be all you thought so check out it's shortcomings in other reviews, as it is not a video camera in a slr body! focus points outside central focus points are fairly rubbish. make sure you have the money for more storage space because raw files are rather large (approx 24mb). but this is inevitable of better images. could do with more photography features rather than hd video. or, video features could be more complete. even after the firmware upgrade.
not many to talk about, one thing it would be is the video button lock up, as it is very close to the menu i seem to press it by mistake more the often as i try to select menu.
it is not light to lug around when combined with a good lens.  that however, is the price you have to pay for the superb quality.
access to the side ports (pc, hdmi) don't have individual covers. could do with a mode dial lock.
the nine focusing points are too center weighted. they need to fill more of the area so that less decomposing is needed. i shoot children's fashion, and if i'm shooting with a low aperture then focusing and the decomposing can result in a slight miss of focus. not being able to lock both aperture and shutter speed is frustrating. nikon have had this feature for years, and the 1ds mkiii has it, why not the 5d mkii? the third stop aperture increments for video is clunky and really shows in playback.
just wish audio could be monitored during recording as well as visually looking at levels during record (these are buried two layers down within the menus and only available prior to recording! doh). but that's really it...
- anything less than prime lenses and l series will seriously effect image quality so again get the credit card out.
the sound recording system is a bit basic, so you need to record sound separately. but it is really a still camera not a video camera!
unable to use third party batteries.
just too bad they didn't update the autofocus. seems to be better than the original 5d, but still not perfect.
not as robust as the more expensive id and 1 ds i have but for everyday use that is ok. the lightweight makes up  for the disadvantage in most cases
expensive
big and quite heavy. accessories for it are very expensive by comparison to lesser canon dslr models.
it is difficult to understand why canon has saved it when they have the design and they have the production technology. just not a too wise saving.
autofocus points not amazing in low light, but i knew this when buying it and the good points far out weigh this.
slightly complicated menu structure
had the camera 4 weeks and havn`t found anything yet, although awb in artificial light isn`t great, but this is easily resolved. would have liked to be able to use batteries from other models.
it wont use my ef-s 60mm
the shutter is a bit lauder than in my old canon, but if you don't hunt for wild life it doesn't matter really
its a bit pricy for being quite an old item though...
only the cost.
expensive but you get every pennies worth in quality.
new batteries very expensive, still 9 point af, battery door is poor build, no fire wire just usb.
fiddly power on switch. if you want excellent image resolution especially for landscape this is the one, but 3.9 frames per second may be a bit slow for action/sports wildlife photographers compared with other faster models. the 21 megapixel sensor will eat up your camera and pc/laptop memory - you will need 16gb compactflash to get just under 600 images in raw. you will need to purchase a external microphone kit to get best use of the hd movie mode as built in microphone picks up all ambient noise including changing settings on the camera. no bulit-in flash.
lacks some of the features of the 7d (60fps shooting, burst rate) but more than made up for by full frame sensor.  note you will need to spend a lot of money on lenses to make good use of this camera.
autofocus system not matching the speed and accuracy of the eos 7d, but very happy with the full frame sensor and overall image quality, if only the shutter speed / frames per second was a little faster it would be the perfect all round camera. ef lens mount only so all of your old ef-s / crop sensor lenses will need replacing.
mediocre build quality - ok but as solid feeling as comparable nikon
still looking
personally if i wanted a camcorder i would buy one, this feature seems just to add cost
batteries were expensive and were very hard to source at launch. could have done with more focus points.
60d have flash, better screen, movies
a very heavy piece of kit when combined with l-series lens, flash gun and battery grip!
nothing yet, i really love this camera
you do need to spend some time with the manual, checking vids on youtube etc. to get the best out of this camera. but that time spent will pay huge dividends.
no flash  .  the need to buy the english battery charger, instead of the european/american provided
i am a bit unsure about the auto colour balance which doesn't seem as good as the 5d mki in mixed lighting, especially tungsten.
expensive, but worth the money
love it but i wish it had more focal points!
poor in camera sound with little or no control - may as well not be included. had to buy a separate recorder and do it the old fashioned way with a sync slate/clapperboard.
typical canon product over pricing.
cost
as yet i have not found any bad points
bit heavy;) but i can live with that
not waterproof
i wish canon would provide a simple flip-down lever for shutting off the eye-piece vewfinder when taking exposures remotely or for self-exposures rather than having to fiddle around with the rubber eyepiece blank on the camera strap. otherwise an excellent camera.
apart from the extra pixels , i see no added advantage to the 40d
the focus could be better
would prefer a slightly stronger build camera.
early days but not found anything yet...
hd recording not as good but it is a stills camera after all
no bad points really except to say this is a camera for professionals and serious amateurs only
getting into video mode is fidgety.
price!
no easy way i could find when using bulb mode for long exposures to display the exposure time on the lcd.  this means counting off your exposures when working pre-dawn.  nothing a watch can't resolve though.
heavy
bit clunky on video side.hdmi monitoring isn't great.watch your dof
batteries and lens are expensive
very little. a faster continuous shooting speed than 3.9fps would have been useful when photographing birds. personally i miss the basic zone options on the mode dial but that is more out of habit than anything and you can fairly easily configure your own.
haven't found any yet
haven't found any yet
pricey but actually more bang for your buck compared to the 5d when it first came out. i've no complaints. why not mould on a bigger battery compartment like my 1dmk111?
lack of autofocus on video
so plastic for me, not enough strong for out but for studio ok
this is photo camera and should not have video, if i want to shoot video iwould use a video camera
very slow shutter speed, so it is not for sport photography.
there are no bad points.
slightly overpriced
nothing
could do with faster fps facility
could upgrade the amount of focus points!
still trying to get to grips with the liveview
lack of continuous autofocus when recording movies
i have rather large hands and i find the multi controller very fiddly.
focus speed for moving objects, which is why i also use eos 1d mk111
movie facility not completely thought through and especially  for uk users. limited manual functionality and have to update the firmware
sensor cleaning could be more effective but apart from that nothing bad to say.
no slo mo movie setting, slightly overpriced,
focus
wish it had better iso setting  with less noise.
dont really have any, just a really beautiful camera.
if you are not a pro or with advanced photography skills, then  stay with point and shoot, or you will get a bad photos.
feels a little cheap for the price.  difficult to access features such as video.  very expensive!
focusing when taking video
heavy, lack of built in flash
the only thing is the focus. a bit of at times. but not bad at all.
no
the cost :(
heavy and compatibilty problems with mark 1.
noisy.
not found any as yet
if you attach a quality lens it just increases the weight!
weight
not got the build quality of the eos 1d but then a lot cheaper
i did not want the video on this camera,  as i am interested in stills only. but there was little choice as it is a part of the camera.
download magic  lantern ... lots of extras there that canon by now should have included in the updated firmware..
no bad points
loss focal length compare to crop sensor.
slightly bulky
only 9 focus points.
af system not up to much but we know that!
no autofocus when in video mode.
a built in flash would be useful for those quick shots requiring a fill in when not carrying full kit
not good at slow shutter speeds.
3. battery indicator is not precise, that can be disturbing sometimes (however you can watch exact left battery percents in the menu).
basically no bad points - you get more than what you pay for!
heavy
pricey
on/off switch not as good as 7d
price, price, price but u get what u paid for, all other accessories for it are expensive as well. integrated speedlite transmitter missing but i'm sure i'll be added to the mk3. big sign on the strap 5d mk2 don't like it just brings to much attention.
n.a.
battery not compatible with mark 1 version of the camera
nothing, else i would not have taken !! ^^
urge to buy more lenses
heavy + you can always moan about the price ;)
price...
cost, frames per second.
would like more pro movie features such as zebra bars etc
i have no immidiate complaints.
weight and price
expensive
video not good raw converter not avialable as a down load for most imaging programs(cs2)
having to go into the programme to change aperture and speed.  does not take sd cards.
fairly expensive
noise when using the video feature, very annoying!
complex
wish it had av and manual settings so i could use it for digiscoping as i would love to try that. my family and i all agree that it would be nice to have a hard copy manual to take out with us instead of it being on disk other than this no bad points
would have liked a more comprehensive manual without going online to read it.
the manual comes on cd.
swithching settings can take too long to work out and not that easy to remember.ptint and paint effect on back rubbing off with less than 6 months use
a proper manual mode would be nice. otherwise no bad points at all. tried others, ie, pentax- was hard to use, had poorer image, nikon not so easy to use.
doesn't really have any
no warning that battery is getting low
better, more comprehensive handbook would be an improvement
no case, help info could be better
the cover for the battery/memory card seems a bit plasticky. it may break in times to come. however, it does the job.
no battery indicator showing charge left
or ability to take several pictures in a row quickly
lack of manual options, needs tweaking with indoor/night shots.  scene settings take care of these problems.
the raw setting cannot be used in any auto mode
no spot metering. would have liked a bigger rear display.
omission of spot meter! the extra cost leather case is a bad design!
there does not appear to be a large selection of ef-s lenses.
included lens not the best!
shutter is noisy in comparison with 350d. dust on sensor after only a few months of use - canon cleaned it under warrenty.
can't fill this in. can't think of any.
still expensive as with all d-slrs. it's no featherweight.
prefer the on/off switch on the top as on 300d
tiny things could be improved - iso speed should be easier to set (i.e. in finder like 30d!) and mirror lock-up should be easier to set.
cheap lens
better information on use of software would be a help.
noisy shutter ( 5 pics a second mean things have to move fast ), high asa/iso  1600+ pictures can have a pattern that looks like printer banding on them ( mostly in the shadows ). the small image sensor makes it expensive to get a true wide-angle lens
the manual is ona disc. as a previous owner i was familiar with the controls, but if i'd have been a first time user i wouldn't have been too happy about having to wade through the disc to find out how to use it! you can't beat having a handbook to take with you on your trip to find out how the finer things work..
could be less expensive :)
image quality is disappointing when compared to previous canon compact cameras i've owned. the pictures have quite a lot of grain.
the smaller the camera, the more fiddly the buttons!
flash coverage is poor and red eye reduction not very effective.
no bad points so far.
auto setting often adjusts so that camera shake becomes an issue. i still experienced red-eye even with the anti red-eye setting set. i also had corrupted video footage when using a transcend 4gb sd-hc memory card despite the camera being compatible with sd-hc.
the really small memory card that comes with it, really should not bother.
one minor minor niggle - doesn't always stand upright on it's own - i worry about scratching the lcd screen by lying it down (but will buy a case)
and secondly, the plastic cover seems a bit flimsy that covers the usb port.
not easy too hold on hand
haven't found any yet!!!!
video uses too much memory.
the shut lag is too long when using the flash, but for me this is ok.
when you slide it into the case you knock the button from picture to video!
i upgraded from the ixus 40 and the build quality does not seem as good. the ixus 40 was built like a tank. large screen gets fingerprints all over it. i have had some pictures slightly blurred. think this was due to flash bounce back.
was quite expensive but i suppose you get what you pay for.
heavy (though i prefer that), not the easiest of cameras to use for beginners. a lot of features are hidden away.
no printed advanced manual which is really essential to use the camera.
when taking out of case the switch gets caught on the material and switches mode
some controls a bit fiddley
nothing that i can think of as yet, although i have not used all the functions available.
i really can't fault this product, it is on a pare with camera's costing twice the amount!
no view finder
picture takes a few seconds to actually take ( i may have it on the wrong setting) which can mean i miss what i was actually trying to take a picture of i.e. an expression or smile
no bad points but with anything that is miniaturised like this, you do have to treat it with care so that it doesn't get damaged.  therefore, it's not really suitable for young children or for using in serious activity sports.
can't think of any yet!!! would certainly recommend it.
the function buttons can be a bit small and fiddly for men (with larger fingers).
sliding mode switch on top always seems to be set to 'video' when pulling camera out of supplied case - a real pain when rushing to capture that magic moment.
it takes a bit of getting used to using it bcause there are so many functions. there are lots of functions that i haven't yet used as a result. the flash is quite powerful, so i'm experimenting with getting better colours/exposure on indoor shots.
just the sd card
no camera case
cant honestly think of any!
difficult to say. we are occassional, rather than keen photographers and it does everything we want in both normal and low light.
even though the red eye reduction setting is on i still find that a large number of photos still have red eye.  you can edit the photos after but sometimes this doesnt even work.
too many features - i just use the automatic mode - it's all i want from a compact camera
nothing to complain about
small memory
use of features may require a little bit of getting used to. those with fat fingers may struggle with buttons.
my boyfriend steals it! quite often end up opening the battery case when i pull it out of its bag.
can't think of any execpt i didn't like the leather strap that came with the camera as i prefer a smaller light strap, but this is only a minor niggle that is easily altered.
buttons a bit fiddly
no bad points that i can find so far.
nothing springs to mind. happy with it.
the little wheel design can be difficult to use with big fingers
could be too many things you can adjust if you just want to take some snaps
memory card with camera too small.
no case as standard with the camera.
have not found any so far !
no red eye on flash and poor pics in low light. camera struggles to foucs providing fuzzy pics.
memory card too low
pictures often blurred when light is limited and flash is on.
had to buy the case separately...the camera needs a cover even if it's a cheap sock for starters
lack of viewfinder
battery could have longer life. need to carry a standby.
i knew it before i brought it but would have loved to see image stabilization on there.
no view finder
can't think of any
on/off button can be a bit fiddely.
off is too small and difficult to access quickly.  this was particuarly a nuisance when the camera had shut itself down although i didn't need it to.
needs a soft case (to protect the large rear screen from scratches in the pocket).
apart from that nothiing!
difficult to remember how to use all the features
no bad points.
although the camera is easy to use in general some of the effects take a while to figure out.
no view finder. in many situations the view finder will help. for example if u want to save charge in the battery..
can't think of any - or haven't found any yet!
everybody likes it and everybody i know wants one - if you could say that's a bad point!!
not found any yet
probably loads of features that i don't know how to use!!!
a bit fragile (dropped and broke one but was so good bought a replacement).  also, dropped one and battery and memory card went flying out, i know this is my fault but just a warning as i lost all my photos as the memory card went missing
zoom insufficient but was aware of that at time of purchase
controls on the small size and close fom one to each other, difficult to operate if you have big fingers.
have not come across any yet
image quality on video could be better, battery life is not very long (but it does have a rechargeable battery), you should try to get a very good deal on this camera as it is now a year or two old. the new is range has come out and these prices are already falling.
no viewfinder - takes a bit of getting use to, just using the screen.
haven't found any but i am not into doing much with the camera apart from taking and printing photos so someone more technically minded might find some bad points.
nothing i can think of
battery compartment easily caught when removing camera from case
only comes with a 32mb card - i would suggest a 4gb at least!
screen gets dirty easily.
don't know how to work all the features, not very intuitive and full manual is on disc so not easy to consult
unless i have missed a feature, you need a tripod to use black and white and other unusual colour modes
the flash can be quite strong and photos can seem bright
various options can be hard to find without the manual - not that you need most of them unless you're more of a pro than me
unable to think of any.
some of the features are a bit fiddly but ok once you get used to it
no image stability makes it difficult to get good pictures when zoomed right in
not enough extras. much prefer the ixus750
for all its features, it is a little on the pricey side.
the supplied memory card is woefully small and should be replaced at the soonest opportunity. i personally did not like the suite of software supplied with the camera finding them 'too idiot proof'
don't use 1600 asa - terrible noise. lack of remote control. canon capture software useless! use breeze.
short battery life, buy a spare.  not much else.
the manual is not very clear - i am very much a beginner
low light capability. high iso= high noise.
resolution maybe too high, quality might've been better if resolution remained at 10mp like the g7. limited performance for night photography due to small sensor compared to a dslr
very poor framing. returned the camera for a refund.
would like to see more coverage at wide angle, rather than having to buy adaptors.
difficult instruction book
controls.  for me reading the manual was essential (something less than common) and as a new user i have to wonder a bit where to find the control i'm looking for.  but it's this control which elevates the quality of the experience.
not experienced any yet!  but i am new to digital photography.
the only minus point so far is the lack of a hard copy of the full user manual. i much prefer to have an instruction book to flick through rather than scrolling around the cd rom manual.
style!
not much grip to hold camera tightly.
just that you can see the nose of the lens in the viewfinder
not really a bad point about the camera but more of my experience with cameras. theres a bit too many features but i'm sure with time i'll learn to use them to get the most out of the camera. is this a bad point????
i haven't found any yet.
dont like plastic lens casing
manual only on cd
it is a technical camera in a small camera disguise. this is not a bad thing. but with the product being more technical than the smaller compact point and shoot cameras it would be nice for the instruction manual to be pre printed for you.
expensive, lcd gathers fingerprints too easy, wide end only 35mm, poor viewfinder.
when shooting in auto mode the colour green looks flourescent and artificial... never seen this before in other cheaper! digital cameras. also if you tilt the camera upwards in a cathedral eg. to take a picture of something on the wall, everything looks really dark and the green box goes hazy! so am a bit dissapointed considering the cost of this camera i would not have expected these problems.
get still get beautiful results.
no paper operating manual, only on cd rom.
a good zoom range but maybe could be better
as with all compact sensors, noisy at high iso rating.
a bit heavier than you expect it to be.
those are stupid problems, its a great camera.
price, noise at high iso
too expensive for point and shoot only use. would prefer printed manual to electronic only format.
focusing rather slow
a little bulky compared to competitors
no flip out screen like the g2 i have. would like a wider angle of veiw.
high to very high noise above iso 400, loss of detail due to noise reduction. in fact too much resolution for the small sensor size, less would be more. bundled camera strap is rather awkward to use, recommend to get a better one.
poor viewfinder. screen easily scratches.
could do with larger zoom, menu's can de a bit confusing.
not very many carry cases for it.
screen brightness inadequate if you happen to be wearing sunglasses
has a little trouble focusing on far away objects every now and then.
flash seemed a bit artificial on final image - must buy a flash gun.
my fingers 'interfere' with these similarly when using viewfinder my right hand is pushing on buttons on that side.
zoom
large lcd screen does not fold out in the way the g5 did and tends to smudge when in use.
not enough grip to hold the camera.... and is overpriced compared to the rest of its range.
cost
no true manual mode.
when using zoom with the view finder you need to be aware that you don't get what you see.
the shutter delay is a little slow in my opinion but looking at other online reviews it is comparible to most cameras of the same price range with similar features.  disapointingly it is slightly slower than my old camera.
there aren't any!
sometimes overexposed pictures in certain lights
fiddly connection for usb, menus not as easy to grasp as other makes i have tried eg olmpus.  tiny memory card supplied.
very disappointed with lense, in hindsight would have just bought the body and then purchaesed a good lense seperately, 70-300 for example. the viewer is rather small should have gone that little extra and bought the 400.
some buttons can be caught quite easily by accident.
now superseeded by a newer model
finish a little cheap, quality of plastic poor, with a tendency to scratch easily, also dust on sensor from new!  controls a little too compact and can be fiddly, especially with large fingers.  kit lens is not the best and does limit the performance of the camera.  the grip is not as good as it could be, it is a bit small and smooth and makes the camera easy to drop in some situations, especially with a larger lens.  default settings did not give the best image; it took some time and experience to get the results i expected.
only had it a couple of months, but cant find any yet.
rather small body - i prefer the 300d for size but the 350d has improved features - can't win them all i suppose!
haven't found any yet.  it is bulky but that is to be expected with an slr.
it's got 'canon' printed on it so all your accessories cost more than they would with a non-canon/nikon.
for people with large hands it can be a little awkward to hold but with the battery grip added it's brilliant.
the lcd screen could have been bigger but the 400d covers that
with lots of digital slr type camera's on the market price could be better
battery life could be better.
non so far
not the easiest manual to follow
only bad point i have encountered is if you fill the memory card fully, you cannot delete any images, as the camera lcoks up and tells you its full. transferred images across using a card reader, been fine since i now keep a close eye on the available space.
kit lens covers a useful focal range but is of basic build quality and is non usm drive.  i would imagine most users will want to upgrade to better optics in the medium term, to get the best out of this camera.  having said that, i managed to take some stunning images with the kit lens!
there are no bad points and i can only say that it never ceases to amaze me just what i can do with it.
hand grip is easily scratched/marked.
the camera strap is absolutely awful, like having a bit of rope round your neck
case not very robust
nothing at all!
for the novice photographer to cope with.
pricey - but worth it.
the semi-hard case is next to useless, always coming detached when taking photos.
a lot of features to figure out but then all similar cameras will be the same.
the 18-55mm lens supplied doesn't get the best out of the camera but its fine for general use
some issues with flash when using camera in portrait
haven't found any yet on the camera, however i also bought the dedicated canon case which is annoying to use!
remembering how to operate some of the more complicated less often used functions
not very impressed with canon customer service when we had a problem.
pictures taken at high iso ratings are not as nice as they could be, peronal view
the 'flap' under which the computer connections are found appears rather flimsy and easy to break.
the look through the viewfinder is a bit on the small side, the kit lens is a bit loose to use but you can buy another cannon lens to suit.
some people may find it a little small.
the kit lens is good value but you will soon want a better general lens.
lcd screen a tad too small.
needs a bigger flash
took some time to work out some of the features.
do not like the built in flash. flash pictures poor
agreement with many reviews i've read, the kit lens could have been better only a minor blot though.
lack of aperture control in manual mode with supplied lens.
lcd screen a little too small. focus can be a little bit sketchy
body a bit small for large hands. the small selector toggle is a bit fiddly to use.
rather large and bulky.  not so easy to use additional features for a non-photographer.
small screen
memory card not supplied as standard
kit canon lens (18 - 55mm) lets down good body.  colours and contrast of lcd not representative of final image once downloaded to pc.
maybe too many buttons!
no ability to run camera off power adapter, which is useful if battery is low and download is big
focus sometimes off.
instruction manual needs simplifying - quick guide required.
limited zoom lets the camera down.  put this camera with a stronger lens and you have the perfect 10.
ott neck strap.  far too clumsy.
lack of a decent case; handle strap has come off a couple of times; otherwise can't really fault it.
the kit lens isn't the best set of glass, but it gets you going.
the automatic focusing is very fast and particularly in close up mode i find it difficlt to focus exactly where i want. in fat i often switch to manual for tricky shots.
finish of the body - scratch marks from nails occur on the body where the lens attaches inboard of the handgrip
builtin flash fairly basic.need a separate flash.
haven't come across any yet.
bigger than a regukar digital camera
the lense does not have a far enough zoom but that is just an upgrade away. the case is massive and doesn't really have must perpouse
doesn't work with my old sigma zoom lens.
not many bad points, body feels a bit cheap and plastic but helps to keep the weight down i suppose. view screen could be bigger.
basic lens as standard, but good enough for beginers
would be better to have just bought the body and then have the option of the lenses to buy yourself.
the strap for the right hand grip, in my view, is essential and should be included in the kit.
they seem to come out to dark.
slightly small screen for reviewing.
no trimming facility
little buttons at rear of camera difficult / fiddly to operate.
the rubber door where you conect the usb cable isnt as good as it could be, and the othere door for the battery isnt much bettere unless you have a long nail to open it with.
is there any?
taking some time to get used to focus points
small viewing screen relative to others on market (now rectified in the 400)
could do with more settings for colour change etc.
my partner hogs it all the time!!
lens cap should be fitted with cord to camera base i keep misplacing mine
strap not easy to attatch/detach
really, there aren't any
the blue print on the rear of the camera is wearing off
screen could be bigger, brightness just good enough for viewing in bright sunlight.
i haven't found any yet and i may not either
inbuilt flash not very good.little on the small side.
memory card - ruined my holiday
i haven't found any yet.
it is all too easy to instigate self timer when not required.
cheap feel to it i guess its because the body is made of plastic
not able to take picture via lcd screen
small lcd monitor
doesnt't come with a memory card.
the lens that comes with this camera kit is not very good, too slow, so, have to get other lens instead.
menu could be esier to use.
weight of camera
images downloaded direct to pc using cannon software appear 'soft'.
self-timer doesn't automatically switch off.
cannot upload pictures to card as you can with cheaper canon models.
over priced
heavy batteries!
not being able to use the lcd screen as a view finder
the camera is quite heavy
battery life quite short with alcaline batteries ,great battery life using ni-mh 2800ma batteries
some buttons are awkard to use and a number of features are not easily accessible but need the push of multiple buttons several times to select the required setting.
you need decent batteries for this one.  i got some 2500's and they are doing me well..  normal 600's got chewed within a couple of hours..
lens cover not attached
sometimes you can catch the function buttons below and right of the viewfinder.
feels heavy
-also would of liked more devices too be able too connect too the camera like light gun for night shooting
some noise at high iso, but fine until 200. no manual settings in video mode. lens could be a tad brighter at middle and long focal length.
as yet i have not found any bad points
i am a bit concerned about the picture quality but have not had enough time to experiment with the different modes and features, so could be my lack of knowledge in using it properly.
slightly heavy
a little expensive for a bridge camera
minor point, but i would prefer a proper user guide manual, instead of the cd version.
a complex product if you really want to use it in depth which will require quite a bit of study.  a paper manual would be helpful.
nothing bad about the camera but
a bit pricey even with the relative low price on simply electronics , certainly would not pay full list price .
very short battery life, especially when using the lcd.
slow response at lower ambient light levels, has caused me to miss shots.    a custom leather case would be a much better option than the cloth fabric case offered.
the manual is on a cd but it would be better to have a manual in paper form included to check operation points while out and about.
little fiddly  to change settings,
does not come with a cover or protective bag
flush.  you can switch on using the easier 'playback' button.  this immediately shows your last photo and you can easily scroll back, but pressing the shutter button half way brings the lens out and you can shoot as usual.  but you still have to switch off with the awkward on/off button.  the video function is quite good but... i have not found a way of keeping the focus in operation, so it starts off sharp then loses focus if the subject moves in or out.  if video is important to you, there is another ixus model (cheaper) which has hd. it might manage auto focus, but i have not checked.  the user guide is a reduced photocopy effort- not up to the standard of the rest of the product.  but it is readable and fairly thorough.
due to its compact architecture, the flash is a little close to the lens.  consequently when used with an underwater housing a shadow effect occure owards the lower right hand side of the image.  this can be eliminated with the use of a separate underwater strobe, a worthwile investment for any keen underwater photographer.  the digital zoom isn't worth using unless you have a very steady hand or tripod, as the noise created even in lower res shots can dramatically reduce the quality of the image.  vga movie recording rather than high definition has its drawbacks (although the camera was launched in october 2008, and technology has moved on.  hd isn't the be-all and end-all in fact i've heard that people need to reduce the number of frames per second in order to playback many hd movies shot on cameras as their frame rate exceeds current dvd playback speeds.)
the round switch tends to flick to other settings easily so you have to double check before taking a photo.
it's quite difficult to get perfect focus when using the 'macro' setting to photograph very small objects. it seems to work best if you position the red dot from the camera's led beam slightly in front of what you want to photograph. once you get the autofocus right though the image quality is excellent. it's sometimes difficult to know whether you have successfully switched off the flash, as both 'on' and 'off' symbols are very similar and very small. the combination of zoom and macro seems to throw the autofocus out slightly. it's better to move the camera closer to the subject.
over complex, non intuitive menus, diddly and poor quality photocopied instructions obviosly a grey import - not made clear on simply's website
need to read up on how to use the many many options.
image noise
instructions came on a cd, but photocopy booklet was included. no case.
pictures display vingetting (dark corners). delayed reaction when pressing the shutter - even if pre-focussed. pictures seem to lack sparkle and most are improved by 'auto correction' on a pc. digital zoom (only) on video gives unacceptable results. the viewfinder is not very clear and does not show the whole of the image. menu navigation is not intuitive (to me). lens cover 'leaves' do not close flat every time.
the dials are a but fidly and the menus take a bit of working out, if you've had a canon before it only takes 10 minutes with the manual and you can see where all the more advanced settings are.
user guide is only on cd.- no hard copy supplied or available from canon. it will take you a while to learn all that this camera can do.
may be a little heavy
no bad points
i did find it a little difficulty with the zoom button placement as it tended to take  a little time for me to control it at the zoom distance i wanted. perhaps it was just me as i was so used to to my other digital being very  precise and better placed on the back away from the shooting position button.
the shutter firing.
would have been nice to bundle with a case.
comes with a cd manual - would have prefered a book.
if using the flask and the underwater housing a shadow is produced by the lens extension 'tube'.. i will need to buy an external strobe.
for a high end compact camera from canon it is very disappointing.  far too slow to focus/take and process the image.  the moment is missed most times. image is not very sharp considering this is a 15 mp camera.  i don't think it is any better than a cheap casio or samsung, certainly much inferior to the panasonic lumix which is less expensive.  i will not be keeping this - a waste of money.  i already have a canon digital slr and was expecting almost as good quality
feels like a toy?
not found one yet
batteries could last a bit longer but with two sets of quality re-chargeable more than enough.
therefore easy to lose.
really need to be able to manually zoom the lens
would have liked a book with how to use the camera instead of having to download off the computer.
the dial is hard to use to move between the scenery settings - it takes some getting used to.
needs a standard screw thread on the end of the lens to take filters (uv, polariser, cokin filters etc).
a bit heavy. resolution of viewfinder could be better.
a little bit difficut to hold, you have to watch out for your fingers blocking and activeting control buttons
although not bad, could do with improvements on image and colour quality and automatic exposure compensation.
no raw file format.
not a great image through viewfinder.
haven't found any as yet
on the whole nothing to grumble about.
you are not supplied with a case, you must buy this seperate added to this the strap for the camera is not up to the quality of the camera
image stops in view finder too long.  i can miss the next shot!
shame cannon didn't spot these simple flaws -spoils an otherwise great camera
if you are inclined to use auto setting only, you may be disappointed. i find myself using the program mode and + 2/3 exposure as i find auto pictures a bit dark.
the lens cap is easily lost. the menus are a bit confusing (or is it the manual).
this camera is not small, it's much bigger and heavier than my previous camera the sx110 and a lot of that bulk is consumed by the gargantuan lens and zoon function.  it can be held easily in the average hand but you will normaly need 2 hands for taking shots.  you will need a proper camera bag - don't be tempted to try and fit this in a handbag!  the stated batttery life in my experience is nowhere near 340 shots, it nearer to 250 but maybe that was becasue i was playing so much with the features and the zoom.  the viewfinder, although it has manual focus adjustment is not very good against the competition.
there are a lot of features on this camera.  it would have been good to have a printed copy of the whole handbook for quick reference when using it, rather than have to use the pdf on a computer.
battery life could be a bit better but used for photography of aviation so using the zoom a lot.
non
bad high iso image quality, counterpart of the small sensor.
not very happy with the camera and wish we had not purchased it.
when looking through picture library the round scroll bar is easy is accidentally move, meaning you suddenly end up looking at a picture you weren't expecting. flash is a bit too strong at first but this is easily fixed with a bit of fiddling with the settings.
a little heavier than i would have liked but that is most likely due to the robust build quality. it is too easy to catch the selection ring which is positioned around the main button arrangement.
the flash cannot be forced on when in auto (it can be force off), this sometimes leaves some unwanted shadows. using one of the program modes gets around this. nightshots can be trouble for the canon, mainly trying for focus.
no high-quality movies
doesn't allow no-flash default.
very small memory card supplied
non
zoom difficult to control
haven;t found yet.
no manual control (no tv or av modes), flash is often to strong (not possible to vary its strength even in p-mode) leading sometimes to overexposed shots.
as and slr user i found the controls not too intuitive
price of spare battery and memory chips
slightly slower than i am used to inbetween shots
easily scratched
is not as forgiving as the sony cybershot in automatic mode.
without the book, i find it difficult to delete single pictures.
lack of manual control.
the instructions
ergonomically uncomfortable. doesn't balance well in the hand. easy to nudge the settings whist trying to hold with one hand. if you give up and decide to use 2 hands it's then easy to obscure the flash.(something they've added an extra little warning leaflet about in the box.
can accidently hit buttons when taking a picture.
control dial is rather small for large fingers
no bad poins for my
with so varied features it requires some getting used to if using the features
video saved in different bits according to when individual shots finished not like a video camera.
haven't found any yet.
the dial location (when choosing picture type) can easily move thus resulting in less than perfect picture quality.
some of the terminology on the camera is a bit technical and alright if you know what it means in the first place.
control system takes a little getting used to.  the zoom is fast but can be difficult to stop at the right point.
not noticed any as yet
didn't come with any memory or memory card, so couldn't use straight away.
creates alot of noise at a slow shutter speed... tripod essential..
smaller viewing screen than other current cameras
on/off button is poorly designed. cannot find it by feel alone. taking photos of animals can be problematic unless you learn how to skip through menu quickly enough for pet shots otherwise a blurred image results.
it's difficult to list the bad points because i'm so pleased with the camera. if i was to mention thing it would be the size of the circular control button, it's small, but i do have big hands! you get used to it after a short while, like the buttons on a new and unfamiliar phone.
please note that i list all these points being as critical as i can. i would still buy this camera dispite them all. and still recommend it to anyone after a great quality ultra compact. if you want better quality, then go look at larger things that won't fit in your pocket.
because of the small size and flush rear buttons its can be difficult to change settings or view pictures unless you have child size fingers.
night shots seem to come up with blobbly aura bits (as though there's dust on the lens... i'm sure it's because i've not got to grips with the settings yet but it does this on auto mode as well...
having to remove the battery to charge is a real let down. having used the canon ixus i7zoom which had a docking station for both charging and transfer of photos, this camera seems a little lacking. the camera window software seems to have regressed as it has less features than previous versions.
it's got no wide angle - loads of close up shots you just cant get when out with friends in a group. the lens isn't wide enough so you have to step back which means you miss anything spontaneous
seems more flimsy than my ixus 70
sometimes but slow with taking the photo if the camera feels to close or light problems, the camera will take time to automatically adjust (e.g- macro) and then will take the photo fine. i havn't found it myself, dont know if anyone else has? but you cant seem to keep flash on for every photo, the camera will decide whether it has flash or not, and i really like to have flash on most of the time.
i have the black one, and the only negative thing i can say is that it is difficult to see the controls on the back of the camera when taking photo's in dark surroundings. ie on a night out...
have not found any
eyepiece is very small
on/off button too small and recessed.
paint scratches easily
would have liked a case cover that would fit over outer case like an ipod to stop it getting scratched as dont like bulky full cover cases so keeping the beautiful gold colour on show and saving time getting out of pocket so as not to miss a picture opertunity
small button not good for fat fingers.
doesn't come with a case so had to buy one separately......shame.
had to read the manual quite intensively to work out many of the features.
even with a fast memory card there is still an annoying delay before the next picture can be taken
poor auto focus in low light, colour balance sometimes wrong
and thats really why i've given it such a low score, because night shots are the thing that's hard to perfect in a point and shoot camera.
the flash and general indoor and night photos are appalling, painfully slow autofocus
not any i have come across.
haven't found any yet
some photo image quality not as i expected- somore reference to manual quide required
taking pics when it is dark can be a little tricky as the controls on the back are so small, that said, i still love the camera.
so small you could missplace it!
it's so small that you might find it hard to use if you have large fingers!
havent found any yet,only small niggle it will not charge from computer
pricey
autofocus little bit slow
viewfinder is very small!
service from simply electronics, which was exceptionally poor and slow.
image quality was disappointing
too small for my father's hands.wahehehe
hd-video takes up surprisingly much space on your computer. 12m is a bit over the top for standard family pictures. not good for pictures of kids because time from pressing the button till picture is taken is long compared to slr.
haven't found any yet!!
optical zoom is on the small size.
because it is so compact some of the controls need delicate fingers
the camera case  - the leather is very hard and the fasteners does not always work!  camera strap could do with something to make it adjustable to fit my wrist so it doesn't slip off!  i had to tie a knot in it!
battery/card cover seems rather flimsy
some controls are a bit fiddly for easy/rapid use
i've not found any yet!!
need to keep changing setting for image distance as the setting you set reverts to normal when you switch off. as with akk digital screens is hard to see in bright sunshine, one of the reasons i purchased the camera was for the viewfinder.
viewfinder image is small, understandable in such a small package. at least it does have one.
battery dies in cold weather ( especially skiing )
only a minor point, however button size takes a little bit of getting used too
hd movies are in a format that can be difficult to play - without a top-of-the-range computer the video playback on windows is poor (stutters) or audio is not synchronised. this is not a fault of the camera - the hd video files created (.mov) are high quality and intact, you just need a high-quality media player to play them! try gom on a high-performance pc.  i play them back on the wdtv media player connected to my hdtv via hdmi after first converting the audio using the mov2avi utility.
a little bit expensive, camera didn't come with even a basic memory card
should come with a carry case, had to buy my own spearately
the scenes cover most common things but there's no 'sport' mode, and no way of manually setting shutter speed or aperture.
it is so portable and would be much more so with its own belt pouch.
only 3x optical zoom - but i realize this is a tradeoff between capability and size.
can't really think of any!!!
being compact, it is easy to cover sensors when operating
couple of pictures came out blurry, but i think that was due to photographer rather than kit.
the only problem i have is that the movie files are not saved as .mpegs. i  haven't worked out ow to view them on my computer yet.
the menu control buttons maybe alittle too small for mansized figures.
can't say i have come across any bad points!
i would like a greater zoom range - sometimes but not at the cost of making it bigger and heavier
the black finish wears off quickly and the lens is noisy
can't really think of any.
you must make sure you have a big memory card for this camera as it uses a lot of space for pics.  the downloading of photos to pc is easy but sorting photos into folders  takes a bit of thinking about.
software not as intuitive to use as previous ixus model but may improve with familiarity
i haven't found any yet.
gold finsh can rub off with use.
plastics used arent great
some parts on camera such as the hd connection cover and battery cover can be easily broken if not careful
instruction booklet extremely poor
strangely enough, the buttons are more easier to manipulate when the camera is in the underwater housing.
i don't know yet about any bad point. the only thing i know is that i videoed  a bit and my card was full so quick. i thought the card was 4gb. my nephew will check it and let me know whether i filmed too much.
battery life
not the best picture quality, but good for what i wanted it for. nothing too flash, a general fun point and shoot.
costs too much .. you can get many other cameras with similar features for ~\xa3100
cannot believe that i had to purchase a memory card.  until i did i could not take any pictures.
the back coating on the camera has started to come of quicker than expected. some images taken in low light are not clear on auto setting
can't think of one.
a little bit slippery so i'm afraid of dropping it.
bit expensive
i have not been able to get rid of the date which appears on the photos and is not always wanted.  can you advise how to correct this?
the 'getting started' manual was far too basic and the manuals disk for use with the computer was far too inconvenient for me to use, so my son downloaded and printed the much larger 'camera user guide' which was a lot more use to me. i haven't yet found any bad points with the camera.
on off button to awkward.view finder to small.difficult to hold needs a case..
no raw mode (though cannot expect it for this price). continuous shooting mode has a delay between shots.
lots to learn on how to operate all the features. small instruction booklet but full information on cd. would like to be able to keep flash turned off for some photos but when you turn camera off and then on again the flash is automatically on.
when zooming in pictures become blurred.
apart from that its great little pocket camera.
controls might be a bit too small for someone with large hands, it may actually be 'too small' for some people.
zoom and flash
being very small it is rather fiddly. that said i would buy it again.
wish it were easier to find a case that matches it perfectly. the one that i got free with my camera (swordfish) is great colour and of course, great quality, but just a little bit too big...
some images come out a bit more blurred than with other cameras and pictures take slightly longer to take.
the lid that closes the battery is fiddlely when closed.
haven't found any yet!
control buttons are quite small.
haven't found any yet
it is too small and fiddily! also it is too complicated with lots of functions i can't imagine you would ever use. bring back the brownie127!
not found any yet
buttons a bit too small so sometimes difficult to press.
can be a little finicky to use as buttons are small, but hey its a small camera.
the instruction book was in italian an the only english version was a soft copy.
the only negatives i could mention is that if you wanted to use all the features of the camera, due to it's small size, the buttons are obviously very small so will be a tad fiddly. but in reality that is not what this camera is about, it takes good quality pictures without the need change settings for conditions. if that's what you want, this is the camera for you.
buttons rather too small and difficult to operate.
no manual mode, just simply point and shot, nothing else
not enough optical zoom but given the size of the camera this is to be expected. usb charging would have been nice.
build quality of the connection and memory card covers.
take a bid of getting use to the featurs.
a manual focus would still be useful every once in a while.
the viewfinder is good but it would be better if not quite as close to the edge of the body.
slightly disappointed with the quality but it is a small camera.
haven't found any yet!
i would have preferred a 5x optical zoom instead of 3x. this camera would have been the very perfect choice.
didn't come with case.
should come with a case really and you have to download/look at user manuals from a disk.
limited zoom
didn t come with a case
takes a lot of learning to to sucessfully use all programmes, but this would apply only to amateurs.
optical viewer could be better
can't zoom whilst recording video
the image screen rotation does not work if the camera is at an angle. it only works when the camera is perfectly vertical.
i was missing a sd card as part of the purchase but it seems to be standard that these are not included with the camera. would be nice to have a kit with sd card so one is ready to shoot with the camera right out of the box.
the buttons are a bit small but with a tiny camera that is to be expected - i am glad i have stopped biting my nails!
complicated menu
slow shutter speed.
lens fairly narrow-angle
only 3x zoom
noisy pics with auto (anything above iso 100). i guess too many pixels for such a tiny optic coupled with trying to balance this out during processing causes this noise.
zoom tricky to use even with small fingers
zoom not smooth, making it impossible to get an exact framing - except by luck.
a bit noisy.
fireworks setting produces really weird visual effects.  for night time shots, pixels go down to 3mp.  flash fires automatically on every setting unless you remember to cancel it.
no view finder
not known yet:)
nothing really to report.
cost
no under water filter
i was so disappointed regarding the quality of the images, as if it is not canon !!
no printed user manual and no case.
specification.
night shoots.
it dosn't have a eye level viewfinder
slightly on the expensive side
a bit complicated for the wife at first
price mainly
cant think of any bad points
no viewfinder.  makes a bit of a noise when it is constantly alterating focus.
no view finder - call me old school
slightly bigger and heavier than others in this genre
sometimes when you take the picture it come out blurred, you have to focus it well first
menu takes a little getting used to but to be honest it does everything automatically so not really an issue!
cant find any - superb camera
trivial point perhaps but i think the camera of this class and quality should come with a case!
expensive for what it is.
should come with some rudimentary slip-case.
buttons too big. always in the way. heavy camera.
woudl prefer it to have a proper viewfinder
expensive for a point and shoot camera.
no viewfinder, but not really required with the large screen
shuts off when cf card door opens - annoying
i need to save up for a good lens to do the camera justice
at first thought this was an expensive purchase but in using it for 2 months its worth every penny.
takes a long time to understand and get to grips with, taking shots can take a lot of setup time.
built in flash seems to under expose abit
lots of features mean lots of buttons - bewildering to begin with, but a thick book to help.
cannot fault it.
no anti-dust. no image stabilisor (not a problem if vr lenses are used though).
i had to exchange the camera as there was hot and dead pixels on the censor but the new one works perfectly fine :)
packaged software is not very comprehensive.  new sd cards can be lost down the couch!
a few buttons scattered around the body.
worry about dust on the chips, but this would be with any dslr.
not found any yet.
fairly bulky and heavy.
can take ages to photograph a detailed shot - whether you've got noise reduction on or off, and whether you're in landscape or auto modes. you can't preview the shot on the lcd screen, so you have to use the viewfinder, and there's no way to turn off the shutter noise which makes it impractical for photographing conference speakers, for instance.
if i had more money i'd buy the 5d or if i won the lottery i'd buy the 1ds
i like the body of my old d70, the d80 is a smaller body which is suprising  with all the added extra features
lack of anti-dust facilities as per d60 or canon. apart from that nothing (taking price into account).
beware of slightest  knock have damaged the digital display
in some creative modes you can become a bit lost off with what all the dials do, but a quick look through the manual will put you back on track.
memory card access lid is easily flipped open by mistake. focus confirmation indicated by small round dot in the bottom left of the viewfinder making it harder to see at a glance whether you are in focus.
can't really think of anything except maybe a bit pricey and ocassionaly the autofocus goes a bit crazy -- but that's probably user error!
instruction book isn't the world's best read!  having two command dials takes some getting used to.
not found any yet
should include a case at this price.
the 17-85 lens does sometimes show purple fringing in areas of high contrast e.g. tree branches against a fairly white sky.
there is a tendency to overexposure on sunny days resulting in loss of detail, so you have to stop back a bit; this is more marked with the nikon 50-200 mm lens than the signa 28-50 mm.
nothing yet..........
over exposes by at least 1 stop on auto, so have to use on manual all the time.
kit lens leaves a lot to be desired, but in view of the cost i really can't complain!
the camera is fairly heavy so lenses with image stabilisation would be a good idea although they can be expensive.
has many features and so takes some time to learn to use.
on/off switch a bit fiddly.
poor battery life compared to the d70
the kit lens has poor glass, and it took four different tries before we found a 30d that didn't have dust caked on the ccd.
very fiddly on / off switch
lots of window's to navigate for image setting, not ease to chance shot peramitors between shoots, no need for portriat, landscape etc setting on the feature wheel, could be use for other setting such as monocrome!
quite heavy
bit pricy at the moment
why did they move from cf to sd cards??
heavier than the 400d, some controls not that easy to understand
it's a little heavy but that's not always a bad thing
steep learning curve to get the best out of it
feels flimsy.
quite heavy,
still a high price
too many settings to explore quickly.
relatively slow 3fps burst rate
not found any as yet
price
the exposure adjustment can occasionally be accidentally be activated without realising it.
no macro
point), using the custom setting and storing a reading from a kodak 15% grey card in bright sunlight gave very good results.  nikon might like to look at why the auto setting is so different!
flash terminals exposed
very large
can't always tell if photo is in focus from screen image.
really nasty build with no features. generally poor picture quality
auto mode. i was disappointed by the number of photos where faces were underexposed. my brother had the cheaper canon equivalent and didn't seem to have nearly as many underexposed photos taken under same conditions.
quite heavy.
some of the sub menu's can take a while to get used to using
some users may need anti-shake facility!
light build
lcd sreen on rear goes invisible in bright sunshine.
lack of weather proofing, slower flash sync than d70/50, limited raw conversion software
left hand side of camera to small, does not enable a good grip .... really annoying as i can't get a good secure hold.
can be fiddly when trying to set menu features quickly
bit pricey
really miss the live preview tilt and swivel screen of the g5 for wild flower photos but only olympus slr has it at the moment.
grip is missing, may slip from hand if strap is not on. did put a grip in my camera under canon logo for safety. does not have hd video (don't have a real need for it at the moment).
expensive! however, not as pricey as a g11, and has the same sensor.
it's a bit on the pricey side.
there are few bad points such as the circular control on the back of the camera which can be moved accidentally when setting the rocker switch controls.  in the centre of all this is the function control wich is very small and needs care when operating it so that other switches are not altered. the cd which comes with the camera contains a very full instruction manual but has to be printed out as continual reference is necessary when first operating the camera. it would be helpful to have a full printed manual but that of course would add to the cost.
shame because otherwise, you can't fault this camera.
slippery smooth outer surface makes it easy to drop
i have also read reports that it is difficult to hold but i have no trouble. maybe its just the americans greasy fingers from all those fries!
operating buttons to unprotected to lock and inure functions.
focus is hit and miss, doesn't focus very well in macro. focus still a little suspect after firmware upgrade,may send back again..
nothing
small size means it's a bit tricky to use sometimes. not that good on auto mode (tends to use too high iso at expense of picture quality) really need to take more control with p, tv or av etc.  i set iso to 80 and use p mode. video quality only avi so not up to latest hd.
lense cap is not attached via a lanyard and no facility for a filter (although an adapter is available from usa).
no printed manual - a real pain!
re the user's handbook... i leave it up to you.
image quality was far better on my 4 year old panasonic fz20. it tends to over expose and fringing around the edges of the photograph is very noticable
no camera bag included.
have not found any yet
not found any yet
does not indicate the amount of betray left
no hard copy of manual, lens cap keeps coming off the strap
no raw format.
the body of the camera is the most awkward i have ever encountered.  it just doesn't feel right in your hands.  it's not comfortable at all.  i have to use two hands on many occasions becuase the camera feels like it's slipping from my hands when i use one.  the design team needs to be fired over this one.  i cannot believe they could not come up with a better design.
no raw support. only electric finder, video also in viewport.
the bad point concerne the delay of livraison, it took 3 weeks to get it, and there no notice in french
difficult to use manual focus, and takes too long to auto focus. image quality average.
only thing i think they need to add to the package is an in car charger for the battery, as currently you can only charge it off the mains.
menu system is not always intuitive- it can be difficult to find a feature quickly
it could be easy to break the flash, as it pops up just where you naturally hold the camera.
difficult to see the display screen; a view finder would have been good. the flash, which comes up automatically, has been commented on by others as a nuisance. i don't find this a problem, and an advantage is that you don't forget to use the flash when needed.
also the wrist strap is too big and serves no real purpose. wrist straps on the ixus range with a sliding ring are much better, hence the camera stays attatched to your wrist!!
a bit bigger than many other compact digital cameras but that's a small price to pay for the zoom and resolution.
the pop-up flash is a little annoying because it sits where you hand hold the camera ... but the quality of the camera outweighs this issue and you soon get used to it!
quite chunky-looking.  lens jammed with tiny amount of sand blown onto it at beach.
it tends to over-expose on auto although you need a photographer's eye to be overly concerned by this in most shots
it would be useful to have a viewfinder as a screen alone is inadequate out of doors when the sun is shining.
the cover for the usb port is plastic and tacky, detracts from the build quality. the pop-up flash cannot be retracted while the camera is switched on. this makes holding the camera slightly awkward for the left hand.
instruction manual not practical on a cd- you need them printed
pop up flash,even when not necessary
software is a bit complicated but you can use any other.
i have honestly not come accross any as yet!
heavy
no optical zoom in video mode, flash always pops up even when not in use, the connection cover is a bit flimsy, multi shot is a bit slow.
flash position
unable to optically zoom while recording movies.
access to some menu options is a bit complicated.
only that the flash pops up when you dont need it. but i can live with that. and you do get used to it.
a bit slow to save images
i'm a beginner and you have to use a cd to read the manual - a paper one would have been better. also i was disappointed it did not come with even a small memory card.
only one really.  the annoying way that the flash pops up at switch-on.  far better to have made it selectable.
video quicktime one of the most usless formats for editing, and in hd doe's not play without jerking on standard 50hz lcd tvs.
as far as i can see this is the only bad point and i'm really pleased i bought the sx200 so don't let it put you off!
would be better if flash only popped up when required, it restricts your grip on the camera
pop up flash is annoying because it is placed exactly where i want to hold the camera.
flash can not be locked in close position
pop up flash is annoying
the way i hold the camera can stop the flash from coming up.     when i remove the camera from its case the battery flap comes open.
flash pops up every time , would prefer a veiwfinder in addition to  screen
flash that comes up when camera turned on. very irritating particularly as i am left handed.
plastic hdmi cover not up to the rest of the build
the battery did not last as long as i expected, luckily i had another camera to use while on holiday.
camera is a little bulky
the pop up flash takes a little getting used to but the performance outweighs this small problem.
side flap that covers the socket for connection to pc/tv is very badly engineered and looks prone to easy breakage
shame about the flash poping up when in use all the time, found it quite a bit of getting use too at first, and will always be aware that i might knock it or break it in some way. apart from that a great camera.
position of the pop-up flash  needs to be closer to middle  of camera
flash pops up on power on and cannot be put down until power off.
no memory in box.
there aren't any yet.
camera strap is too short.  i like to attach the camera to a belt or bag in order that if it is dropped, it won't hit the floor or more important, others have little chance of removing it from your possession.
it is a bit bulkier than other small cameras.
have not found any yet
battery rechargable time left doesnt indicate on the camera accurately,its either full or empty.
flash does take getting used to; however, you soon learn to keep your fingers away from that area and it really doesn't cause any kind of real problem.
navigating is a bit non intuitive to a silver surfer
some times acan be a little bit slow to take the next picture
pop-up flash slightly irritating until you are used to it.
flash.
the position of the flash
the flash pops up every time the camera is switched on even when the flash has been turned off. i also find the flash location annoying  because it is where i tend to grip the camera with my left fingers - perhaps if i was right handed it would not bother me!
large awkward looking body
can't think of any
would have liked it to come with a case.
flash popping up all the time
nothing i could find so far.
access cover to pc, printer and tv outlet sockets is cheap and gaudy looking - like the toys i used to buy from hong kong as a kid - and can be a bit fiddly.
even if you turn the flash off, it stays stuck up in the air - it would be better if it folded away.
video playback controls clunky, flash popping up all the time!
left hand side looks cheap for the product
can struggle to produce quality images in some conditions. quite large camera so may not fit in your pocket.
there seems to be a flaw with the lens movement which if it jams the camera becomes unusable and can only be fixed if sent back to canon. if taken to the beach be aware of sand or dust getting in to the lens or if touching the lens whilst its moving it can jam up. i have owned it 4 months but as i have a mark on the ase of the camera canon will not repair it as it could have been dropped so i have had to pay to get it fixed. i have looked at forums on the net and it seems to be a common problem which is a shame as its a great camera to use.
no viewfinder, difficult to compose shots in bright light.
haven't found nothing wrong with it yet
flash pops up in the way
no
quite large for a compact camera but that's a small price to pay for the quality of shots.
the flash keeps popping up and there is no zoom on video mode
this is a my second one as the first suffered a cracked screen  with a little accidental pressure . it is a weighty product and is quite fragile to handle. my advice, don't get too adventurous unless you have insurance for peace of mind.
as everybody else says, the pop-up flash gets in the way. as the camera is comparitively small there isn't much other room to hold it.
slightly large and heavy for a compact.
no underwater housing available
flash thing pops up, but you get used to it.
dont know when exactly flash will come in standard mode.
it isn't accepted by older printers.
perhaps not as 'pretty' as some rivals.
a few little niggles but nothing to spoil the camera.
slow shutter speed
no bad points
cant find any bad points
quite heavy for a compact camera
no optical viewfinder
nine at the moment
still fits in my pocket.
popup flash very anoying
not a layman's product. need to learn how to use it
no optical viewfinder.  can be difficult to compose the picture in bright sun.
downside is i wouldn't like to drop it, the plastic case does look (though it could be) very durable.
i haven't managed to find a sport function so don't know what it'll be like when i'm trying to photograph a moving target. .when downloading images the software makes a new folder for each day's photos and doesn't allow you to choose where you want them to go.
lack of viewfinder
some controls a bit fiddly.
power supply could have been stronger.
the biggest draw-back with this is that it eats up batteries. it takes only 2 aas (my previous canon had 4) and even duracells lasted only a day or two on holiday. rechargables are obviously the ones to use with this model. also, when uploading the photos onto computer using the software provided, changing the target directory and generic image nameis very fiddly. the software with my previous canon allowed the user to change both directly from the import dialog.
small image sensor
have not found any yet
haven't discovered any so far.
need  rechargebl  baterys,  and  charger
a higehr spec card as a standard supply with the camera
a litle heavy on batteries
sometimes it can be a bit complicated
lots of features=--still learning to use them all.
not easy to see the image on the screen in sunlight, so taking photos can be a bit of a lottery - made worse by my photo-chromic glasses.  a little pull-out awning over the screen  might take care of this
would have liked a view finder as sometimes its difficult to see the image on the screen without getting a reflection.  a bit difficult to open battery compartment quickly !
fairly chunky
non
its awful. i would have returned it, but i pushed it aside for so long that i ran out of time.
a little too expensive, the screen is good but can make a slightly out of focus picture appear sharp, the af settings could be all in one menu rather then custom settings but a minor nit really, the video mode, though useful for some was something im not going to use, i'd prefer a cheaper version without this option.
cost, but you get what you pay for and this is one mega-camera.
nothing for the moment....
it has movie mode which i very much doubt i'll use, therefore i personally would have prefered them to leave this out and make the camera cheaper.
the main one is that against a dull background focusing of moving objects becomes difficult but still better than the mkiii.  also the point focus is not as good as the 7d which i also have. however, the 7d has for me some noise above 400asa.
too expensive!
cost
the price - but if you want real quality you must pay for it. comprehensive set up menu is not for the inexperienced - but then it is designed for professionals.
its quite heavy and its complicated to set up. i would prefer having a video button to start and stop video
after having owned the mark ii's so long, i got real familiar with the controls.  i'm still trying figure out a few of the equivalent controls on the mark iv.
full frame should have been involved due to the cost and maybe an extra frame rate higher then 50fps like 120fps for slow mo and a raw codec
only one. why does the flash pop up in good light whilst in automatic mode. i still havent figured out how to stop it. can anyone help.
live view is fiddly and not quick to focus. 20fps on hd video is sadly short of 30fsp, but its ok i guess? high asa settings negated by auto picture corrections (in custom functions), meaning limit on asa top settings. why on earth canon decided to put the video start/stop button separate to the shutter release i don't know!
i am still looking for...
reduction in resolution and contrast is noticeable compared to 5dii, but as it is less than a third of the price, this has to be taken into account.  personally i  would only use the 500d up iso800.
doesn't always present information in logical sequence. there are occasional instances of a lack of familiarity with standard english.
a bit flimsier than the 300d....  fingernails seem to mark the plastic near the handgrip quite easily.... only a cosmetic thing,  though.
lcd display is fixed in the back which restricts its use but is viewable at an angle which helps a bit but a fully articulated screen would have made the camera unbeatable at the price.
continuous shooting soon locks up.
live view limited to only certain modes.  autofocus not available in movie mode.
the battery life is not as good as previous models, and i'm not sure why the button for switching between metering modes has been relegated to a menu option. this is something that i use often, so this is slightly iritating.
no autofocus with movies
hfaveen't really found any!
i take alot of hdr photos and was hoping they would have included a 5-point bracketing feature by now. that is being really picky this is a great camera, especially for the price.
video is not easy to focus and not obvious how to use; still not sure whether the pictures are as sharp as they should be - possibly just getting used to the focusing.
battery life now much shorter due to power absorbed by stabiliser
in auto iso mode you cant set the highest iso value that you are comfortable with.
contiuos shooting is not always as quick as 3-4 frames per second.  video hd feature is not really worth it.
it will be replaced soon by the 550d !!
more megapixels than needed. better to fokus on image quality! live view is a dissapointment, due to difficult and slow autofokus!
money wise a bit over the top
auto focus in vid\xe9o mode could be better.
hd record is fiddly - could be made simpler
it has a plastic feeling on some parts of the body.
havent found any yet
can't use 'live view' in the basic zone shooting modes.  a hinged lcd monitor screen would have been nice.
it's not a canon eos 7d.
expensive initial purchase, batteries and storage cards from older models are often no use.
there are already electrical faults relating to focussing points
it would be useful to have a protective case for the camera,
can't think of any
no shutter speed priority; only a 4x optical zoom; having broken one previously, the protection for the lens is a bit flimsy
the picture quality is pretty poor and the slightest wobble gives very blurry results. i'd had an older model of a canon powershot digital camera that i absolutely loved but this version is just not up to standard. i wouldn't buy this camera again!
whilst the buttons and other moving parts are fine, the plastic casing feels cheap and lets down an otherwise excellent product.
nothing really
build quality could be better.
can't think of any.
zoom is not the best you can buy but without spending hundreds of pounds i would not expect that!!!
the only downfall i found was it didnt come with a case
a little flimsy on the outside.
cant find any
can't think of any.
a bit flimsy and could have been sold with protective case.
the display screen that you look at before taking the picture always looks a bit fuzzy but when you have taken your picture it is crystal clear.
i received the camera and found out there was no memory card, on the description there was no mention of this. even though it zooms in well , the atcual picture comes out in terrible quality.
no obvious ones
haven't found any yet
does not balance well for timed shots, some sort of mini tripod needed
not many bad points! really beats the competition and for the price you really cant go wrong. only one point i would like to make to canon is that is hasnt got an otical view finder, which i sometimes prefer and also would have saved on battery life due to not having to have screen on all the time. apart from this everything is perfect.
we bought a case with the camera to match the body.  unfortunately the case is a shade of blue which is good for girls, but not blokes if you know what i mean.
only thing i have noticed is that sometimes there is a red line on the led screen - don't know if i should be worried about this but it only occurs occasionaly and disappears again.
8 on image quality), though that might be due to only standard auto settings i use, as i tend to prefer the point-and-shoot. more features/functions might be more fun, though for the cost it is a good selection.
in low light quality the image quality suffers a little. however, with a more thorough understanding of the camera features this can probably be overcome.
switch between modes is plastic and is the only weak element
so far have no bad comments
didnt get memory card or case ???????????????????????
didnt recieve camera case or 2gb memory card
would like a small strap to prevent dropping
i did not receive a free case or 2gb card with my camera
i didn't receive a 2gb memory card ! x
free case and gb card never arrived.
i didn't receive any free case or 2gb memory card
not sure the quality of the kit lens is a match for the quality of the camera. i'm a little disappointed at the results indoors, where i thought the dslr would really shine over my little fuji, but there isn't that much difference. i'm considering splashing out on a better lens (as i saved several hundreds of pounds against the 7d), such as the 1.4 50mm, or even the 'cheapy' 1.8 50mm - which i hope will generate even better results, especially of portraits of my family.
finding a good memory card that can handle the hd video speed - i bought a new samsung 16gb sdhc class 6 card (550d (canon) said the card had to be a minimum class 6) the card worked great for stills but was not fast enough for video. i have now purchased a transcend 16gb class 10 sdhc - internet reviews indicate this card can handle the video so lets wait and see, in short check the cards are proven to handle hd video in 550d before purchase just any old class 6 card may not work!
the canon 550d does not have a swing out lcd viewing screen which makes low level photography difficult, unless you buy an additional viewing screen.
shame the rear screen doesnt come with a screen protector, but thats easily rectified with aftermarket ones available
the battery and memory card are not interchangeable with the 400d but are of superior quality, otherwise i can't fault the product.
mode it's slower than i expected for still images because the mirror has to lift out of the way so i don't use that feature except when shooting video.
(portrait, landscape etc) ones
also when shooting using the built in mic you get the noises of the lense and focusing picked up in the film.
what am i to do, now, with the darkroom ?
not sure i have found one yet.
i have found no bad points as yet.
intensive instruction booklet. would recommend slightly larger type face is used. canon accessories are very expensive compared to the compatible stuff like lenses.
not enough zoom for me, but that's the matter of the lens
the on-body lenses are very expensive and can cost as much as the camera did for the mid-range models.  i wish the kit lens had a longer zoom length as this is something i really miss from my old camera.
still trying to find one!
i recommend purchasing the canon ef-s 55-250mm is telephoto lens, as the ef-s 18-55mm is kit lens is only suitable for portrait and wide-angle shots.  the built-in flash is also not great (but this is the same with all dslrs), and you might want to purchase a separate flash unit.
i can't think of any, its a fab camera in the price range. the kit lens is a bit limiting but most people have/buy other lens to go with it.
a bit penny pinching making the hmdi cable an extra.
the battery life is ok, but if you are going out or away and expect to use it heavily probably worth getting a second one.
several times i have knocked the program dial when switching the camera on and off. the dial seems a bit too easy to turn in this respect and i have found myself shooting in manual instead of  av. maybe it's me being clumsy but wonder if anyone else has noticed this.
- haven't found any so far
could come with memory card although you could purchase one at same time
why did canon name the same camera in different country. 550d in uk and t-rebel for usa. it just confusing for us amateur whos looking for a descent dslr.
however, i also use a 55-250 mm is lens and focusing at the telephoto end might be a liitle slow for just point an shoot- which i assume is expected i suppose.
not cheaper - a bit below the belt but that would be the only bad point in my book.
the kit lens is nothing special.
not much... you get what you pay for.
nothing so far.
in a quiet location when useing the movie function, turning the 18mm to 55mm lens for zooming does make a slight rubbing noise witch is picked up by the in built microphone.
not found anything yet
i can't fault a camera within the price bracket that i have paid that has all the functionality that it has. it is clearly a technological marvel that 10 years ago would have been unthinkable at 10 times the price paid
having said that the video quality is fantastic.
nothing major, canon have got it right!
the kit lens it quite poor, and lets the rest of the camera down. i only bought this with the kit lens as a stop gap so that i could get used to the camera and until i could purchase a better lens (i now have the 17-55mm f2.8 - fabulous!)
could't find yet
build quality is ok but slightly plasticky. overall feels like it can take the odd knock or two. much better builder quality than 1100d.
built quality. but no, don't imagine that it's made out of cocacola bottle, like i did before i took it to my hands. the worst thing about the built quality to me is probably main dial's, reduce/magnify buttons and maybe (not sure) even shutter button quality. talking about the video mode, well there's no continuous af during filming and the mic catches every little noise from the camera itself, like manual focusing. but all these flaws comes to a body/it's built quality. note that i couldn't find any cons in picture/video quality or camera performance.
a little on the expensive side.
should come with a memory card.
supplied lense is the only setback.
video autofocus will be a good to have but not a big issue as such.
/
the lens that came with it is very basic..thats why i bought a better lens
lens supplied not so good considering the price of the camera
sometimes complicated to find the exact feature that you want.
me and my inexperience - i want to learn all it can do but it can do so much! i'll get there though.
would recommend paying the extra for the 18-118mm lens but it is at a premium
the instructions that came with it were not as full or as helpful as they might have been. it took me longer than i would have wished to learn how to use the lense to good effect. but i have managed to do this now.
so far i did not found anything to be a bad point
nothing
doesn't come with a memory card in the box! as far as i could tell you have to have one as the camera has no internal memory!!
although the 18-55 lens image quality is good, the lens could do with having a greater telephoto range.  so a longer focal length zoom (say a 75-300) is a definite additional purchase.
accessories are very expenisve
before the video function ( may be i don't use the video function with the best method: i learn) for me the video is only some time. it's not a camera movies.
as a pro i don't really need the video facility. some of my images are trunciated so i am not sure if there is a fault on the camera. a bit flimsy compared to pro cameras. would like to have kept aperture and shutter control on separate wheels, the jumping between buttons  is slow and a nuisance. the battery door is also very flimsy and has come off on a number of occasions. the card has jammed a few times as well.
the manual you have to plough through - but it's worth it as it allows you to utilise all the cameras features.
auto focus can be a bit tricky
battery doesnt last very long really, always handy to have a screen that swivels but you need to pay more for that luxury
nothing bad about this camera.
can't think of one.
it's a bit heavy, but no more so than any slr with a similar lens
the 18-55 lense that it comes with isn't very good in all conditions i.e. inindoors, especially for hd video recording.
should come with a uv filter. the lcd needs protecting.
no bad points about the camera,
cannot think of any!
feels a little lightweight and plastic compared to other cameras in the range.
non as of yet
.....
screen (glass) above lcd scratched easily
not been used enough yet to comment
not found any yet!
video autofocus is cumbersome
i was disappointed with all the little extras you have buy like memmory cards and a cable from camera to tv, the 18-55mm lens was ok , but now i'm considering a lens with better zoom
drop it and you'll break it.
not found any.
haven't found any yet.
i would be nice to have a memory card supplied as part of the camera package.
accessories are expensive
i haven't really used it enough yet but one thing that does annoy me is that if you are using some of the different modes like close-ip, it doesn't seem possible to turn off the flash which is really annoying.
nothing yet
body is plastic and feels cheap.  expensive for the quality of the body
haven't found one yet but then i'm mainly using it in auto mode just now.
nothing wrong with the product, but a few extra accessories would be nice (bag, extra battery)
i have'nt foiund any bad points as yet
there is no memory card included (not even a small one for a few token photos) - i gave this to my husband as a birthday gift but we were unable to take any photographs of the celebrations . . .
isn't that what a camera is for ?
bulky
no bad points
bit costly
missing the paper manual and was missing the cameras battery which i am still awaiting. emma from the company has been helpful to date but i am still awaiting a battery and the manual since 22/01/12 when i ordered the camera. hopefully these matters can be resolved so i can test the camera.
still trying to find one.
i can not think of one
cannot believe not supplied with lens hood, most cameras come with a lens hood. 1080hp movie mode is fantastic but uses so much memory  12mins of filming will use about 4gb.
it has no bluetooth
lens small zoom but i just have to buy a bigger lens, simples.
0
not a 100% viewfinder
high price
non i could thuink of
could do with a better zoom
- also the lens you get in the bundle isn't great, but once you buy a slightly more expensive lens there isn't really anything to complain about.
not a bad point but a wish that perhaps you could offer a left handed version! find it slightly awkward to focus with my right hand....but getting better with practice
the build quality doesn't feel excellent to me, also the prices aren't what id call truly reflective for a mid-range dslr.
not found any yet! :)
assimilation des r\xe9glages de tous les param\xe8tres. cela semble un peu complexe, mais s'applique bien avec un peu de logique.
automatic settings are poor, manual mode is teh way to go (as with all dslrs)
nothing major but the lens bayonet is plastic but acceptable due to the price
nothing
menu system is a bit complex and slightly intimidating for a beginner
havent found any bad points as of yet
the zoom is not that great if you want to take shots of something in the distance. i'd recommend buying a larger lens in addition (and its worth spending a bit extra for an is lens).
i had the misfortune to drop my camera only 4 days after recieving it and although it was in a camera bag, the front piece below the flash broke off and the flash is smashed. i can only use the cameras with high iso until i can get an external flash or try to get it fixed.
could have come with a small case but just came on it own.
the nly thing i can thing of is the lens cap is not attached to the camera when removed
haven't found any yet
manual is very difficult for a raw beginner
flap over connection doesn't look like it'll last long.
sometimes the auto focus can take a while and if there is not enough lighting, it occasionally refuses to take a photograph but i am sure i will find a setting that prevents this.
difficult to get the best images possible, bad auto-focus
i am just the beginner - novice user.  there are more than enough features for me.
tad expensive.
did not realise i had to buy memory card in addition.
18-135 lense should have better definition but could not afford the 24-105 professional lense at 800 euro
the auto focusing can sometimes take long and decides not to take the photograph.
sometimes depending on lighting the camera takes a while to focus and you can miss your window of capturing a picture, but im sure with more superior lenses its even better.
aucun
it doesn't come with a memory card which means you can't use it straight away. also unless you have a good knowledge of real photography, you will need a book to help with fully utilising the camera.
cost!
price has decreased a lot since before xmas
note : requires a good knowledge of  slr  photography to  maximise performance ,thus not suitable for beginners .
bit slippery in the hand. 10 megapixel sensor will sound a bit mean as the year goes on. buy it for its size and low light ability which is when most compacts are used i.e indoors and poor lighting situations
2.no panorama
zoom is limited compared to some compacts but then i wanted a camera that fits in my pocket with high quality images.
the price is a little steep and the flash pop up is slightly annoying but you soon get used to adjusting your finger.
battery life is not very good
understanding when raw is available was a little confusing and frustrating.
the most unfortunate point of the camera is that there is very little, if not any, grip on the surfaces of the camera. i am left worrying whether i will drop it or if it will just slip from my hand. in addition to this the grip is compromised by the fact that the flash pops out on the camera where you naturally take hold of the camera to most effectively secure it.  cases and batteries are not cheap!
position of the flash and the mechanism to activate it. more often than not, the finger is over the position which has the flash. so it is often stopped from coming out when it is enabled, the camera needs to be restarted to make the flash operable again.
fixed zoom and focus in the video mode.
not so easy to handle with big hands. advanced features require more than basic knowledge, which is quite natural.
call me old fashioned but a 'hard copy' manual would have been good
not weather sealed
bad for night photography
without optical viewfinder
cannot find camera case
can be fooled on auto - flash may not trigger for fill with backlighting
the zoom is by far the worst part of this camera. the range is somewhat limited to start off with but the lever that contols the actual zoom actvates too quicly and is very corse and hence it is very difficult to finely adjust the zoom to whatever scene you are trying to photograph
slightly confusing menu initially
should come with a snug fit case or pouch perhaps, to keep pocket fluff at bay.
the hd video mode is not full hd (1080) but only 720p. this isn't necessarily made very clear in all the literature. i find it somewhat confusing to have two control dials and never remember which i should be using for different functions, sometimes losing me precious moments for a shot.
if the flash has been enabled from your last photo it will pop up the next time you power the camera up. not a big problem but this is where you are holding the camera.
can get complicated to use the advance functions.
not too good with low light settings.
macro could go a bit closer. i don't much like the flash exposure, but canon always seem to me to get that wrong.
it is a little bit more bulky than what i was looking for - however it is a very small price to pay for all the features and image quality it produces.
the placement of the flash still catches me by surprise - it pops up right where you're holding onto the camera, but i'm sure i'll get used to it soon.
check if your edition of photoshop will process the raws.
weak battery
not so good wrist strap, battery doesn't last long
lot of options not available in raw mode
many options not available when shooting in raw format.
difficult to learn how to use the features
to do that you'll need to buy a decent prime lense. when you see the output from that combination, it will put a smile on your face.
not so much a bad point but more  a sign of how much a novice i am, it is less than intuitive to find some of the settings and quite often you have to trog through menus to find what it is you wish to adjust. it is expensive and hence not as good value for money as it might have been, particularly with the 600d coming onto the market - i did consider this but prefer the weight and features of the 60d.
it is a plastic body, which while still robust, is not as reassuring as a magnesium body which i am used to. if you want a magnesium alloy body, buy yourself the 7d
nothing but i've a lot to learn with this new camera.
these are really quite minor issues though, the camera is still an amazing bit of kit, possibly not worth upgrading from a similar or recent model but from a 20d, oh yes, do it, now.
can't decide which lens to get next.
its very heavy
magnesium alloy body would have been nicer
the funtion button need to push just can scroll it,too bad.
i think they could of splashed out a bit more on the lens cover!
a bit heavy and bulky, but if it wasn't then it wouldn't be so versatile.
body light weight

18 - 135 mm lens that came with the package ...the zoom lens when tilted down on the neck strap moves out . not an issue but it isnt supposed to do this , small problem not anything im worried about .
small number of focus points
not found any yet.
will let you know when i find one. :)
stingy with the accessories supplied for the money you pay.
its a bit plasticy but that's reflected in the price..
not really bad points for a new photograph like me.
rather wide in size, didn't feel comfortable in my small hands so i returned it.
at wide angle and extreme zoom settings chromatic abberation is very noticable for about 1/4 of picture width on each side of the picture, and at extreme zoom the right hand side of the image becomes very blurred
perhaps slightly too big
expanding the iso isnt as straightforward as other canon models.
plastic body
no real bad points - there are lots of features on this camera and it may take some time to find out about them all!
i did not receive my instruction manual book with this camera
nothing that affected my use of the camera.  price of accessories such as flash units a bit high
have not found any

the menus on this camera are slightly confusing when you first use them.
flip out screen - cant get used to it.
still looking
the only issue i had was that the canon menu display was in chinese, so i followed a youtube tutorial and a few clicks later it was in english.
to soon to mention any
wide angle setting on standard lens results in top corners being clipped off: not all of the viewfinder frame image can be used.
too many to list
does not feel quite as robust as previous model.
have not found any yet
no bad points
using live veiw takes some getting used to, it puts the mirror down to focus and then lifts it to take picture
haven't found any yet
3. an xlr input offering phantom power, not just a 3.5mm mic socket
lock on exposure setting control seems unnecessary but not a big problem.
lens ef-s 18-55mm is have poor build quality.
is is on the sensor not the camera
the charger will not work
i spent a lot of time reviewing, trimming and experimenting with av settings and taking bracketed shots, and soon ran the battery down.  probably due to the energy requirements of the very large image area that takes up the full height and width of the rear of the camera body.  i will go out and buy a second battery without delay.
large flush screen could have done to be slightly recessed to prevent damage while in the case.
difficult to understand the workings of the camera, too much on a very small unit. the cd is only a printout of the written manual, not too impressed with it, but will learn l hope.
battery life is relatively limited. worth buying a spare
olny had camera a month and colour is wearing off the corners of body already
have not found any yet.
zoom may be a bit limited for some applications
touch screen is not sensitive enough
battery life is low. we have 3 spare batteries.
non so far
video is poor in low light
no instructions on how to use the different funtions
only bad point, which is not the camera itself, is that on hd mode the videos only play on my one year old laptop and not on my six year old desktop. i have started to set the video on standard mode as this is still good enough quality for my needs and plays on both machines, also the file size is much reduced and the card can store more photos and videos.
can't find any obvious ones.
battery life exhausted without giving a warning
just taken it away on holiday for two weeks and have download a few hundred photos and don't have any complaints yet.
probably supplying a case with the product would be a good selling point.
features menu eg changing to and from fish eye feature slightly confusing for new user
would have appreciated knowing that this wasn't in the parcel before xmas morning! despite charging the battery in advance, there was no m card so the product could not be used immediately.
have,nt found any.
pity no carry case comes with the camera.
battery cover feels flimsy when open - take care not to snap off - suspect goes with compact size - certainly not a reason not to buy!
nothing found yet!
although i normally use my eos 450d in manual mode, i am still trying to navigate the 115's menu and features - less rarely required and gimmicky features would make the camera more user friendly - so i almost invariably use it in auto mode.
colours in the video are a bit strong.
make sure you've got the wrist strap attached, as the camera is small, shaped like a bar of soap and is just as slippery.
the only real bad point is that it doesn't come with a case or memory card, however, due to the cash back offer, this more than covered the purchase of them.
i have not found any yet.
i don't think there are bad points.
some of the buttons are a little on the small side.  also it is easy to cover the flash bulb with your fingers while taking photoghraphs.
i cannot get the hd videos to run properly on my pc using windows live or media centre.this was not a problem with the lower resolution canon ixus 75 i used previously. the button to start and stop video recording is very small and flush to the camera body.
have not found any yet.
have not found any yet.
no memory card provided to get you going until a greater capacity and rating one could be obtained.
i'm an amateur photographer trying to turn semi-pro, so for me there were not enough manual options. that's not the fault of the camera, which is ideal for a beginner.
no case included. wrist strap poor quality, but that's about it.
haven't found any
no bad points found so far.
learning the symbols and finding your way round the menus is a challenge to short term memory!!
not sure if its a bad point as still learning to use camera but have noticed that  image quality not great on zoom in on auto but i may have it on wrong setting/would be better to take photo and crop.
not as sturdy a build as my previous ixus 70. the camera often has difficulty selecting te correct scene mode automatically resulting in blurry pictures at times
havent found any yet
picture quality due to a fault.
no viewfinder, hence in bright sunlight hard to see the screen.
.
red eye spotlight is annoying, haven't found how to switch it off yet.
pink ha
flash can very occasionally be over powering
i got it to replace my canon ixus 870 is (2009) and the new camera didn't feel quite as well built as that slightly more expensive compact.
no bad points
taking a picture in motion is difficult when the flash is on as the camera takes a while to focus. plus, there are not many features at all.
no separate sound recording facility.
controlls can be a little fiddly
deleting process is too complicated.
i do miss having a view finder on extremly sunny days when its hard to see the screen.
focusing features are to complicated better to turn them off
pop up flash
it can be a little slow to actually take the photos
1 of 2 purchased replaced due to grit blocking lens cover - had only used it in the house but still seized up. so not particularly robust and will need to be cared for. will need a cover if sitting at bottom of handbag.
people with large hands could struggle with the small buttons, but it is not a big problem.
haven't found any yet
need to buy big sd card.
had to return the camera as the motor stopped working within 10 minutes of getting it. the good side of the bad is that the local store did a straight forward exchange, so no hassles with posting or waiting. new camera has been ok since.
final picture image is ever-so-slightly out compared to the preview image
slightly fiddly buttons, i'm sure someone with bigger hands than me would struggle. build quality not quite as good as my last ixus.
takes time to select special shooting features.
one video was strangely out of focus all the way through- suggest user error!
lack of viewfinder
not any but you do need to be careful when taking photo if you have big hands.
but, this is my wife's camera and she is well pleased.
daughter has a much cheaper camera with a fantastic panorama facility that doesn't involve a computer.
nothing really
not enough zoom and sometimes the auto feature isn't accurate.
stiff buttons
auto mode is a bit slow, and the display then drives you mad while it finds the right bit of picture to focus on!
with all of the options to chose from, switching out of auto mode can be a bit daunting at first.
i really wanted a camera with a view finder - the only problem i have had with this is that i can take photos in full sunlight with the camera at a landscape angle but if i turn it to portrait i cannot see what i am taking.   i have got the brightness at the max.
do not like the terminal cover which seems very flimsy and likely to break so i use a card reader to transfer photos to my computer.
despite this, a great camera!
small niggle re the popup flash being right under the position where i naturally want to put my left index finger when holding the camera.  in reality i'm getting used to this and you can keep your finger down holding the flash back - manual says this is ok.
i'm really struggling to find my way around the camera. this is partly due to still after 3 wks of owning it not having had a chance to go through the manual, and partly due to the number of features that lead you off in various directions as you play with them. but really if you're paying this much for a camera you need to invest the time in understanding the more detailed functions so i know i'll get there when i have a moment.
flash pops up atomatically every time you switch on.
minor niggle - have to view through rear screen - no visual viewfinder which can be difficult in certain circumstances.
on and off button a bit to small or in the wrong place, if you have long nails or big fingers its a bit of a struggle to turn it on, but thats all.
also, the camera does not feel very ergonomically comfortabe to hold.
dial to select scene option is irritating as very bulky - the options could have been done using a menu option
the camera is quite heavy compared to other compacts.
great zoom but wide angle is limited
a bit narrow to be held easily, and it's too easy to accidentally disable the flash by bumping it.
i can understand what people are saying about the flash on the camera, however it's so easy to adjust to! the flash doesn't have to be up all the time, obviously unless it is needed.
there isn't any really - the only thing is possibly - if you plan to take a few videos carry a spare battery as that really drains the battery.
although the screen is large, the image does not fill the screen so it might as well be smaller (i ordered it for the bigger screen!)  i also feel that this camera needs a viewfinder - used in bright light, it's quite difficult to see the screen.
only learning to move your finger off the flash when you turn it on, and really that is not difficult to do.
flash is located in top left hand corner which can be annoying as this is normally where i hold the camera
ummmmm.....................can't think of any yet!
on/off button small and awkward to operate for big hands. takes some time to get used to holding the camera without covering the flash when switching on.
the pop up flash takes some getting used to as it is just where you want to hold the camera.
flash a little annoying when turn on, finger stops it opening. but i knew this when i bought it, just takes getting used to.
the zoom button is a bit fiddly and the flash is in a bit of an inconvienient place but to be honest the good points far outweigh these small bad points
loading software for a camera is a bit of a nuisance!!
the bad points are the flash. every time i turn the camra on i leave my finger on the flash and it dosent pop up. i know i should not put my finger there but its when im holding the camra with my left hand and turning it on with my right it happens. and only with this camra.
i find menus somewhat confusin,but i suppose i`ll get used to them..as all previous reviews i`ve read,the flash is poorly positioned
camera is not easy to hold, or get a grip on, its very slim, shiny and slippery! the on/off bottom is so small it needs a fingernail to 'touch' it on/off and hard to find by touch; also the shoot button is not so easy to find by touch. camera good for young, nimble fingers, but not having those any more i would have preferred a camera that was more sturdy to hold when shooting, and buttons more clearly defined.
i'd perfer a better manual or dvd to teach me how to use the camera to its maximum.
the jessops own brand case that came with the bundle is a disaster because of the large velcro pad on it.  the hooks of the velcro embed themselves in the rather silky strap that comes with the camera and has almost destroyed it.  not a good design and i have had to remove the velcro.
w function would've been the icing on the cake :o)
havent found any yet!
i desperately want to buy the underwater housing.....however the advert promoting it implies that the housing is not waterproof!!!  i would appreciate advice please.
pop-up flash gets in the way
the zoom function is too small and fiddly.
having had a panasonic lumix, i find this model not as easy to use.  more difficult to delete photos, find the self timer mode, for example.
expensive.
the camera is not very good at night time ( if ur at a concert) if the room is dark with flashing lights. just doesn't focus very well
disappointed that no instruction manual was provided in english yet instruction manuals provided in finnish, swedish, danish. the camera came with a 3 pin uk style plug so why no instructions in english. it is a menace to have to refer to the english version online instead of having a handy booklet.
the manual could be better quality printing and paper for a digital camera in this price range and quality.
some of the dial combinations are not intuitive.  tendency to hold where pop-up flash is housed!
mode, rather than retaining the full picture view - very disappointing and very annoying.  i think the camera is somewhat overpriced for what it offers.  compared to the sx120 is, the sx210 is is sadly lacking and i would not recommend this particular camera.  the sx120 is is a far better camera and exceptionally good value for money.
the flash is definitely in the wrong place. you want to put your finger there when you hold the camera.
i knew about this prior to purchase.
can't find any!
the pop up flash which automatically pops up when turning camera on is situated on the top exactly where you hold the camera, it takes some getting used to.
i didn't find any and i hope i wont.
could do with more than one battery
no view finder
the hand strap seems very prone to snagging on the velcro parts of my lowepro pouch. even after a couple of snags it's not looking like it will keep its form for long and it's quite difficult to pull it off the velcro without causing any damage. but it's only a strap!
haven't found any yet
difficult to use sone features but this is purely because there are so many!
not exactly a bad pint but so many functions, i'm not sure i will get full use of them all.
battery doesn't last very long, buy a few spares!
anything above 400 iso is pretty unusable. manual settings are tricky, and manual flash power setting requires going into a menu - i've found myself using one of the auto scene modes for dark environments like bars and clubs. no 2-second review in anything but auto mode!! flash pops up right under where your left index finger naturally sits.
positioning of flash is a little bit awkward
slightly bulky, flash mode sometimes need to be switched on digitally and manually for it to work.
at the moment i have not found any bad points
i did not receive an english manual with my camera!!!!!!!! would appreciate one if they are aavailable
now the negatives, the biggest of which by far is the video quality, which is so poor as to be almost shockingly bad. maybe it's the bad, dull weather recently forcing the camera to select a high iso (you can't set it manually in video mode) but i've checked it over and over again to make sure it is actually on the hd setting (it is). colours are dull and lifeless, detail is simply non existent and both focus and exposure are all over the place: unless you or your subject are static, the focus spends longer than it should 'hunting' and auto exposure is set way too high, so everything looks over-bright and washed out. hd video was certainly not the main reason i bought this camera, but it was one of the influencing factors and the fact that it is all but unusable is very disappointing. battery power: i've taken around 160 shots so far (mostly photos + a few short videos) and the battery is now reading low - sometimes capacity increases after a few charge cycles and i can only hope that will happen here, as 160 shots is really not good. awkward to hold: i may just need to get more used to it, but the sleek design, big screen and pop up flash position doesn't leave much to comfortably hold on to.
nothing find.
flash in wrong place, want to hold camera on top of  flash.
yes, it's a bit pricey, but it is true that you get a lot for it.
on off switch abit fidley
price is high
no leather case for it.
little chunky but features make up for this.for my level of expertise(zero) too many features!!!
the camera takes a couple of seconds to confirm its auto-focus, so if you are too 'snap-happy' you can get some blurred pictures.
no sound on when using movie mode off and on button to small to use comfortably
although this camera features a big lcd display, the entirety of this big screen is not utilised the playback stills. the flash pops up when you power up the camera regardless of the ambient light level. the body of the camera looks very plasticy. this sort of minimizes the capability of such powerful camera.
where the flash pops up,can be a pain.
the position of the flash.
the flash is not that well designed
your finger always stop the flash lid raising , due to desighn
flash gets in the way.
can find it cheaper elswere
flash comes up automatically when you switch on but you can get round this by putting your finger over flash to stop it happening.
the only bad point is the lack of a manual.
tried it for the first time at a perty las weekend and found a lot of the shots to be overly bright (too much flash) and a lot of the shots were blurred, i do have other canon camera's and have never had this problem before.
on-off button is bit small so doesnt work at one go, bit heavy so needs careful handling, response time seems a bit slow i.e. you cant take 10 shots one after the other you have to be paitient set urself and then click, so that means you may not be able to capture sudden moments
place of flash
i either want to have full control of the settings or want the camera to do it for me if i am taking casual family pics. all the shooting options in between seem to over complicate and clutter the camera.
the outappearance of this camera is sort ot  different from i thought when i saw the picture from the web
badly positioned flash, could not hold camera comfortably. over vivid colours. zoom kept locking on to the wrong subject whilst on long zoom. very cheap covers for cable connection and battery. a lot of features are in sub, sub menus, frustrating when you want to point and shoot quickly.
slow at taking pictures
rechargeable battery
knot one bad point
nothing yet
flash pops up when turned on
flash is in a bad position,
the pop up flash is a bit of a pain - its position means you are forever preventing it opening by leaving your finger over it. the build quality is good - but it isnt stylish and a bit of a lumpy piece of kit when compared to similar and equally capable cameras. shame its only available in black as the look of it would be enhanced if it were available in silver.
think for the price that the camera should come with its own carry case.
still looking.
my previous sx110 was excellent for one handed shots - the sx210 is more difficult to handle single handedly. and the zoom lever was easier to operate on the 110. but smaller size and extra zoom make up for these
menu systems are fiddly and this is not helped by having two different systems to access different options.
little chance for operator input to select better settings.
where the flash is positioned
at present not able to identify how if at all possible one can take quick action shots as we can on our canon eos
flash popping up on start up is annoying but was aware of this before making my choice to purchase same.
not many but flash not in best position and not figured out how you can browse or skip through pictures without going through all of them!
would like a spare battery pack
when turning on my hand prevents the flash from coming on but you will get used to this and avoid this happening
wrong charger (eurpoean) but uk/ire power lead supplied
didn't actually receive my free case!!!
in my opinion i can only suggest one point and that is the position of the flash light,being placed where one would normally hold the camera.
the power cord was for non uk socket.
on full zoom it is difficult to hold steady. the pop-up flash is annoying.
only minor bad point is the pop up flash which takes some getting used to
image quality on full zoom
flash opens where you normally hold the camera which can take some getting used to.
but not really a bad point.
plug in port a bit flimsy, but i'm clutching at straws really... great product overall
not too sure about the flash.
the pop up flash is a bit of a pain every time you switch it on,gets in the way when you hold the camera
would lke to have seen mutiple image stitching
price a bit high
makes noises when tracker is on.....
-doesn't have basic features like making pictures black and white but other than that, its perfect
absolutely nothing!
you have to search around for the extra features on the camera if you wanted to use it for quick use and the continuous button doesn't take immediate shots.
there is no dedicated playback mode just a button to press which means that the lens is out while you are looking at pictures. my old camera you could playback with the lens retracted
should be fantastic if it had a manual focus mode.
slightly flimsy battery cover flap.
fiddly usb cover slot
battery and memory card cover and the cover over the interface connection appear to be flimsy - hope i am wrong.
only one colour to choose from...
haven't found any yet!
not found any yet
no manual override
battery is not for long time.
no optical view finder. could do with a lip around the screen to protect it when camera laid down. colours not as good as my old camera. same picture taken with both cameras, showed grass more yellow than green with canon. still acceptable though.
camera can switch on if not carried in a hard case.
the only thing i find difficult to come to terms with is the fact that you have to half press the button to focus and then press again to take the picture, (i do prefer the old fashioned cameras in this respect)  but this is the same for all digital cameras.  although i must say, i find that aspect easier with this camera than with others i have used.
case feels a little plasticky
charge is going fast..
picture quality not as good as expected. but i do normally use slr!
quality sometimes not so great in low light. not much warning when battery running out.
o
horrendous image quality, especially when there's limited light.
there are no bad points for this product
hesitation on flash triggering on distance photos
heavy, plain
when you upload pix's into pc image quality is not into the standard.
not found any as yet, but would have like a choice of colour
no zoom very basic
feels a bit flimsy
nothing!
havent found any yet.
you hear motor while zooming during video making (but only rather weak, but there are other compact camera's that don't record zoom motor noise)
haven't discovered anything yet.
battery could be a bit better but it still takes nothing away from this amazing little canaon.
manual is on disk. i downloaded one from the canon website and printed it out. it is just over 231 pages so two ring binders will be needed. possibly too many options for my use.
the flash pops up from the top left and as i usually hold the camera there i nearly always have to retake the picture or if getting someone else to take a picture of you - i guarantee they too will hold it down.
short battery life
a bit expensive for a compact camera
little bit expensive
pop-up flash easily held down by accident causing error message. lack of a printed handbook is inexcusible for a premium price product with such wide functionality - a really cheapskate saving on an otherwise quality product.
find holding it up to frame a shot not as good as having a viewfinder.
the auto popup flash is were the figure goes to hold the camera so need to be a little cautions while talking photos
because of design your hand get in the way of flash
video lag and noise distortion.
aucun pour le prix
not a bad point as such, but with so many features its going to take a while to learn how best to use them.
the flash is a little weak.
the flash automatically pops up and it's placement is here you naturally hold the camera so can cause you to lose your grip.
short battery life, menus a bit complicated.
haven't found any real ones yet, but the battery doesn't last too long. should work fine for a full day though.
the light reflected is bad forom the lcd panel. there should be some way in reducing this glare.
i am looking for....
flash pops up where you hold the camera, but you get the hang of it soon.
has to remember how to switch modes and change settings
lack of view finder can be problem when using in very bright light, otherwise no other bad points found as yet .
aucun
too many functions that can be a bit messy and confusing
pop up flash just where you tend to hold the camera. no manual flash control when in auto - only auto. i tend to use the flash when there is backlight, such as when taking a portrait against strong light. i'm sure, once i get used to the settings i will find a way round this.
needs to study to get best out of the camera
video
you do get used to it in the end though, and hold the camera slightly differently, then it's fine.
the battery wears down fast when shooting video
a little on the expensive side if all you intend to do is take pictures in auto mode.
am struggling where certain features are on the s100, however the results make it worth persevering.
takes time to learn where all of those features are!
sometimes a bit fiddly remembering which menus to change settings but on a tiny camera such as this its a compromise between size and space for buttons.
2 no paper manual, you have to download from a disc.
shame that the s90 battery did not fit but does have slightly higer capacity
tendency to overexpose backlit scenes
no hard copy user manual.
short battery duration
wish it had a longer zoom then i would not need another camera. not really a negative point though.....its just that good.
the price is a bit on the high side.
small sensor
only one - zoom limitations.   it is difficult to judge the amount of zoom to create the perfect composition.   i am guessing practice makes perfect!
the number of shots i was told the battery could take wasnt what it turned out to be. took less than 45shots within a week,and the battery went flat
the basic controls are in a getting started booklet, but the user guide is on cd which i don't find very useful, although the on screen text compensates.  this is my third powershot and the previous ones managed a user guide booklet.
the pictures do not compare with a 400 pound camera obviously and it is not as slim as some other compacts, but overall a good chioce for a point and shoot pocket camera with an optical viewfinder.
the batteries don't last long at all if you take lots of shots.  always have some spares with you ...
i don't think this camera has any bad points.
optical zoom not available once you are in video mode.
the battery/card department not always easy to open.
non really....
the instruction booklet is just a 'getting started' guide. the main instructions are on the disc. if like me you are not too hot on computers, you will struggle to find what you want. then when you are out taking pictures, you will think 'what did it say'?
view finder quite small takes time to get used to
card and battery compartment a little 'fiddly' to open (especially if trying to change them in a hurry).
can't think of any off-hand.
but nevertheless is something to watch out for. as such my review can only be based on my experience of two identical models - if picture quality was as expected i would have given the camera a high rating.
user manual in cd format. would prefer booklet included.
like all the point and shoot digital cameras i've used it is a bit too slow. taking shots of anything that's moving is a bit hit and miss due to the shutter delay. guess that's one of the reasons people buy expensive cameras though.
use of standard aa batteries is disappointing since they deplete rather quickly. we are now using rechargeable aa's.
instructions for use a little confusing.
i haven't found any yet.
slightly awkward for large hands!
plastic tripod socket.  some of the effects such as 'toy camera' are not very useful.  no case with it but it fits in your shirt pocket so you don't need one.
small range of settings, unless you know how to program it.
it's a bit bulky but that's the price to be paid for using aa batteries. there's probably some technogical reason for it, but if this camera could operate on aaa battries, it would be better.
it uses aa batteries which tend to make it comparatively heavy
the viewfinder is rather small and can be difficult to locate when you are in a rush to take the picture. also the field of view through the viewfinder is less than what is actually taken on the photo. this can be  annoyoing at times as a better picture would have resulted from the greater accuracy of the viewfinder, although obviuosly extraneous material can be edited out later.
aa batteries make it a bit more cumbersome than it need be
it uses batteries as if there was no tomorrow.
battery life. even with the best i can get it doesn't last a morning, even with out flash
have not found any so far
the reason i bought this is because i wanted a compact camera with an optical viewer. this is the only compact that has this feature i believe. it is useless and just shows that same image whether you are zooming or not. it also doesn't show any information - in fact it seems to be just a superficial extra that didn't actually do anything. this is the only part of the camera that was a dissapointment.
aperture control
quite heavy on batteries; using alkaline aas now since didn't find nimh batteries lasting without camera complaining. like many other cameras now, no doubt the plastic catch on the battery compartment will be a weak point ...
low light setting did not compensate for low light conditions. not much difference between different settings and auto. pictures not as good as my very old 3m pixel camera.
does feel quite plastic-ey and the battery compartment is quite difficult to close sometimes - quite easy to turn it on whilst doing this! it does feel like it (the battery door) could break very easily, wish this part was more substantial.
especially removing cover to access battery and memory card.
i found the focus frame(s) a bit confusing; the viewfinder is somewhat tiny.
no anti shake stabalizer
not a lot! it's cheap and cheerful and you get a fine little camera for your money.
would be better if the shutter button was on the outside of the mode button.
not found any yet
lens cover can be damaged easily, get a padded case asap
the downside of the batteries is that they seem to run down veru quickly....
would have preferred greater optical zoom
viewfinder is very small camera has to be held very close to eye makes framing shot a bit awkward
would have been nice to have had a case with it, but this is a minor problem as they are easier enough and cheaper enough to purchase.
runs on 2aa batteries which can run down quickly, particulary if using flash - would recommend 2 sets of rechargables and keep a spare set with the camera
care must be taken in poor light as focussing can be slow in these conditions.
as far as i can see, the video is only usable in landscape.
shame it didn't come with a memory card.
also it doesn't show on the screen that how much battery life is left/consumed.
see review for camera case - should have been for the camera
suffers from excessive shutter delay.
like most cameras in its class that take aa batteries it hasn't been designed to run on rechargeable ones. that doesn't mean it won't run on rechargeables, but it does show a low battery indicator from an early (if not initial) stage and when it finally refuses to work with the batteries you'll find that their charge is only part spent, so unless you have a smart charger that discharges them before charging them you'll be shorting their life. (i'm talking about nicad and nimh batteries; lithium's may be better.)
the functionality is basic compared to more up to date cameras.
battery life is low but i have bought some rechargeable 2500mah batteries and the problem appears solved.
haven't found any yet!
personally, i would have preferred a better hard copy manual rather than the disc
not so fast so need to hold it steady.
bit 'plasticy' - but then for the price :-)
too much info on screen?
it does have a clumsy plastic body.  i will need to set aside a lot of time to study the manual before i can take full advantage of all the features.
it has a lot of effects, so it takes a bit of time to figure everything out. would have liked this camera to be able to record sound when recording videos.
you have to change the batteries; i would have preferred it to be with a charger.
buttons too small and close together, not enough features, zoom slow to act
could work out expensive using normal batteries but i intend to use rechargeable batteries which i was informed were compatible.can't think of any other bad points....
optical zoom does not bring subjects as close as other compacts.
batteries run out quickly.
the viewfinder could be more accurate - only covers about 70% of the picture.
did not include memory card, but then, people can choose exactly which they want.
fiddly access to batteries, memory card and download connection.
the only real criticism is of the viewfinder, but a small one. being optical, it does not respond when using the zoom!! a bit of imagination helps, though
image in viewfinder when zoom used is not the same as appears as the picture, or via the monitor.
no bad points discovered yet!
slightly bulkier than a 'normal' pocket digital camera - but still fits in the same case so the difference is not marked.
i have to say that this is the second 1200 ,the first returned under guarantee because the electronic display went haywire.this did not put me off however.i would have liked a more compact battery system but then perhaps their bulk gives a more solid feel to the instrument.very little to dislike and a lot to like.
zoom ratio slightly low.
everything is marked with the lowest score. for example, the camera may have warranted a 7 for ease of use for the short time it worked, but ultimately, i couldn't use it at all. i would have scored overall rating as zero but that isn't an option. this was my third canon powershot but the first to fail.
horrible plastic exterior
can't use the camera memory card in my stand-alone usb card reader (to computer), so far. i need to investigate further.
could doo with a rechargeable battery
don't get it for great image quality
too much information appears on screen when to start with you just want to take pictures.
hand strap difficult to install.
viewfinder is very small
rechargeable batteries don't seem to last long before needing a recharge.
i have not found any yet.
non
.  i was expecting something better than my ageing samsung and i`not sure it really is.  overall a little dissappointing for a canon, even a cheap esat to use one
powered by batteries not li-ion
non-rechargeable batteries
instruction manuel on line and this needs to be printed out.
drains alkaline batteries too quickly.
could have more functions like black and white or maybe you can blur the back or the front of the image
not too happy about 'aa' batteries but at least the're cheap and easy to get.
no guide marks in the viewfinder to help correct alignment in close-ups.
on/off and shutter buttons not best placed and the openings for battery/card fiddly for less than perfectly agile fingers.
feels and looks a bit cheep
no case
the camera was bought to replace a brilliant canon powershot (with viewfinder) that was stolen.  the viewfinder is its bad point. i regard a viewfinder as essential for the many occassions when the screen cannot be properly seen.  the eyepiece for the viewfinder is too small and it is hard to frame a shot.  it is a pity that canon has effectively dropped the viewfinder as an essential part of compact cameras.
screen quality not brilliant. a bit plasticky
no selection of resolution; slow to fire shutter; loss of traditional powershot bulge for right hand means less comfortable to hold; shutter button slightly awkwardly positioned
without the instruction booklet, it is not clear which way round the batteries go in the battery compartment.
pastic body of camera is poor
disappointing battery life could do with li-on rather than aas
a present for someone else
lapse time is slow, but for a camera at this price you need to accept some compromise.
unfortunately shutter lag and shutter button needs getting used to if you have had other digital cameras.
too basic and bulky for those used to digital cameras.
very low image quality in low light withour flash
digital zoom limited
x4 zoom
not found any yet
no prtectve case
viewfinder small
auto focus is useless
plasticy
nothing as of yet.
shutter lag would make it less suitable for action.
how ever needs to come in more choices of colours :(
optical view finder not as good as a630
bit of a plasticy feel compared to my last sony camera, but got over that !!
optical viewfinder quite small
it doesn't have some of the snazzy colour options - but i don't need them.
the zoom is probably the week point, but it is still ok .
feels flimsy compared to their a480. battery cover looks like it won't last long.
battery life could be better and battery quite fiddly to replace. will definitely need to buy/carry a spare. cover for usb and mini hdmi sockets feels flimsy. pricey.
no hard copy manual.
cant really think of any.
battery cover a bit flimsy. menus not as intuitive as others i've used before
menu system takes a little getting used to.
you need to a memory card to start taking pictures apart from that i couldn't find any faults with it
auto focus can be a bit inaccurate but only while your getting use to the camera. also the shutter button and surround is plastic; asthetically metal would have looked and felt better but thats me being picky!
haven't found any yet!
feels a bit 'cheap' with plastic components.  cheaper nikon that this was replacing felt better in the hand but did not take pictures of the same quality.
as i only had it for a month, i may not have noticed everything but one thing i noticed is that it doesn't give me as good a grip in my hand compared to my previous canon powershot a710 is (that side of the camera is fairly smooth but not 'slippery' though...)
sound recording level from video is not all that good, but it was not bought for video use.
i find the menu really confusing and hard to work out. hubby hasn't had any problems though, so i think i just need to get used to it.
for the serious photographer this doesn't measure up to an slr or bridge camera, but for its size and price you'll struggle to beat it.
expensive for what you get
this model is slighly bigger and heavier than my old one, but this is mainly to compensate for the bigger screen.
it is too early to judge, but i do just wonder if it is really robust enough.
takes a long time to find and get used to and use the features.
manual / auto switch fiddly to use
in auto mode outside on a dull day i had to keep putting the flash on manually or photos were almost totally black even with the flash on the photos were not good
hard to discover/use some of the functions on the manual settings
would prefer to charge the battery within the camera rather than having to remove it but gin this is probably just becausey old camera worked in this way. i'll get used to it.
no user manual included.  it takes so much paper and ink to download it all and is bulky to store.  the old little manuals that used to come included with the camera were so useful and so much better.
if you are wanting a camera with a lot of manual controls then this is not the camera for you
i must say i dont think ive come across any
haven't found any.
doesnt feel as sturdy as previous ixus750
it came with a  2 pin continental   connector
because of the amount of features available the menu system, which is well thought out, can be quite extensive, if you want it to be - but you can just leave in auto mode for easy use. the buttons could be a little more pronounced to make this the perfect little point and shoot camera.
compared to my 5 year old ixus, i don't think the image quality has improved that much. it is good, no question, but i expected more to be honest.
slow start up time so not good for quick snaps
can't fault it, for the price
would have much preferred it to have a small hard copy of the users manual rather than having to download a number of a4 size pages which are not so easy to carry around.
limited instructions in pack but more available on- line.
not sure why it does not come with a card or carry bag to protect the rear screen as the cost of these would be minimal if provided with the camera
takes a little while to get used to changing from auto to manual to change settings.
the sound of the zooming action when recording video however this is only a minor issue.
broke within first week of use when dropped, screen immediately smashed, not very resilient
you will never get the same image quality on this kind of camera as my slr but still get to keep in your pocket.  again vidoe camera is not as good as a dedicated video camera
you do not want to put it away!
haven't found any yet - but i guess it's early days as it was a christmas present
battery life adequate but keep a charged replacement in reserve if you're out for any length of time. take extra care on the beach....small compact cameras and sand don't mix whatever the make. i always use a lens brush to keep it free from grit.
zoom a bit difficult to operate
the cover over the usb socket seems to have a rather flimsy anchor point.
haven't had it long enough to comment on durability/reliability
haven't found any yet
no bad points found so far
zoom button is a little difficult to control.
not good as i tought so.photos is not always clear,silly plastic parts,not very happy.
have not noticed any yet.
haven't found any yet
written manual could have been a little more comprehensive, rather than having to refer to the cd rom
having to refer to disc for anything other than basics
it struggled when taking photo's in a nightclub. it kept on switching to macro mode.
no bad points. photos not quite as good as my slr but  for general use excellent
don't think my next camera will be an ixus
the cable a little fiddly to insert, and the controls are meant for delicate fingers (but it is a tiny compact camera afterall)
can't think of any, love it.
non so far
not really a bad point but you often need to use pragram mode to get the best out of the camera but this is easy to use.
flimsy plastic cover for hdmi/av out ports.
i would have preferred a silver model but very few available. i am getting used to black though.
shutter noise seems louder than on my previous ixus and the shutter itself is more delicate  (this probably has some relevance to the shutter speed) and is easily moved if touched with finger when the shutter is closed, although quickly moves back to its resting position. i would recommend that the camera is always carried in a camera case as i would not trust the shutter to remain intact if put in a bag without protection.
cheap and flimsy plastic cover over the usb/hdmi sockets.
slightly complex menus if you decide to take more professional pictures
nothing yet
i wish it had a view finder, sometimes difficult to see images in bright sunshine.
comes without a memory card, so you can't start using the camera until you have one
- pop-up flash in awkward position, just where you naturally grip the camera
it has no internal memory so won't work without a memory card, but not really a bad point, just something to be aware of.
i do dislike only having the screen to look through.  in certain lights you can see nothing it appears really dark, and what you get is luck not judgement.
not very impressive image in low light conditions, flash pops out and this sometimes is a nuisance as you hold the camera to take pictures
as most compact camera, it struggles in the dark.
would be nice to have a viewfinder.
unexpectedly slow operation.
flash in a slightly awkward position but you just learn to work around it
could be better battery life.
as with all compacts the taking of photos by looking through the screen is still in my mind not as good as a view finder on an slr but ok.
not easy to get a safe grip when holding the camera to compose a shot.
instruction on the internet
as yet have found no bad points.
the controls could be more user friendly but this is a minor point.
no memory card included
haven't found any yet!
no sports mode. can't trim and crop on camera. but it is a basic camera, - a point and shoot camera.
no memory of its own and does not come with  memory card
images are awful. not at all sharp, and lots of image noise. the camera was bough to replace a 5 year old camera, but the picture quality is worse. i expected better from canon.
i would have liked a rechargeable battery
did not come with a memory card - have to buy that separate
non at present
i'ts physically small for my mum who has arthritis but she is coping with it well.
it is light on battery use, but its a shame that i have to carry a bunch of penlight batteries.
nothing i've discovered yet!
the colour is defiantly not red but glittery pink, not great as it was a gift for my boyfriend.
haven't noticed any
lack of a manufactures case lets this kit down.
i couldn't fault this prioduce.
- small buttons for some with bigger fingers.
feels a bit light and flimsy.
no case, so had to purchase my own-extra cost on top of the camera.
bad quality in busy conditions (gigs)
poor image stability. for an extra 10 pounds the 2400is has a much better image stability feature.
not found any yet
- the shutter reaction can often be a bit slow so you turn the camera round to see your picture and end up with a photo of your face...!
00
no av cable connection other than usb port so cannot connect up to some of the older flat screen tvs that dont have a usb port.
no trimming facility
battery length is very short.
should be supplied with camera case
haven't found any yet.
the images are not so good
no bad points at all really.
zoom is not the most powerful, digital zoom is limited in its use.
the instructions are very lengthy.
would have liked more information in the small book. not everyone has a computor and i sometimes need to refresh when out and about. cannot remmember all the info that is on computor
accessing the scene modes could be easier
zoom - image quality reduced substantially with over 5x zoom.
no protective case.
the focus seems a bit noisy but that's being very picky.
yet to find any tbh
battery does not last long, i take loads of photographs so i purchased a spare.
be very careful if you take to the beach - sand is a killer.
battery life isn't great, but easily revolved with a spare battery.
no handbook is again very mean of canon. it seems that the battery life is on the short side. the buttons are small and fidley.the sound volume when replaying a video clip on the camera is very poor and nowhere near my old ixus960is.
easy to misplace due to small size - maybe canon could invent some tracing device to find it.
slightly slow shuter
recommend spare battery when taking lots of photographs on holiday
buttons quite small and fiddly, cant seem to find aperture priority on it , but for this price it does  brilliant job anyhow.
should have come with a case
battery cannot be charged in camera and spare batteries are expensive.
didn't get the camera !!!
i did not realise the camera did not include the memory card - it is the first camera i've ever bought that was not a complete package - i cannot use the camera to check it out under the return warranty until i can find the time to go shopping to purchase a memory card to fit.  if the camera is not a complete package it should be stressed in the product description so buyers are not caught out,
nothing
.
it takes a little while to work out how to get to the various scene modes.but i'm sure with practice it's easy. i preferred the button arrangement on my previous canon camera.
charging. you have to remove the battery and put it into a charging station that plugs into the socket.
the flash can be a ,little annoying.. but only slightly, i owned a ps sx200 and the flash on the ps sx260 is a vast improvement
position of pop up flash is a bit annoying as it sits under your index finger when i hold the camera.
battery did not last quite as long as i expected ans there was no warning that the battery was getting low .
extremely difficult viewing the screen in daylight.
a bit slow between pressing shutter and taking photo.
battery runs out too quickly and the  flash gets in the way .
only problem i am having is keeping my fingers out of the way of the pop up flash.  just got to learn to re-adjust my hold on the camera!
quite heavy for a small camera. my finger is always where the flash 'pops' up and so registers an error. will have to re-educate myself to hold the camera in a different place!
other than that fantastic.
camera
doesn't come with a case
takes some getting used to. i kept switching the flash on when i wanted to adjust the exposure or aperture
takes a few seconds to take a picture from the second you press the button.
the flash, when it pops up, can be a bit of a shock.
camera shake at full zoom
flash pops up just where the left hand holds the camera for steadying. very very very bad design fault.
i wasn't impressed by the picture quality. also, the flash is located where people normally rest their left finger(s) and it suddenly raises. unless you are familiar with the equipment you won't waste a shot. also a bit heavy.
- how! still not sure how flash works
battery life isn't spectacular.
auto settings don't produce sharp images
unfortunately my model suffered from zoom motor noise when using video and had to be returned.
as always why no hardback manual had to get this from a website and pay it wwas reasonable but the idea of usng a tablet or phone to flick for featuures is not good!
have had a few issues with some of the images reporting as corrupt but not sure if it is the camera or the user
impossible to reply to this questionnaire as the \xa310 voucher promised has yet to appear (after over a month and many phone calls)  we plan to buy an xd card with it, so up to now the camera remains useless.
flash is hidden in camera body under, where your finger is when holding the camera, when auto flash comes on the flash lifts your finger off the camera, nearly dropped it.
flash button pops up under where one holds it!
flash in the wrong place it hits your finger  if  you are not careful.
need to use prog mode to turn off flash
pop-up flash can be unexpected and annoying some times.
some features hard to find if you are not very intuitive. paper manual a great help.
not really a bad point, but if taking a large amount of photos in one day, it would be useful to have a second fully-charged battery.
pop up flash is located on top left of camera, so caution when holding camera - makes one jump.
no written instructions as to all the programmes available.
instructions only available on cd.
not intuitive
faces
if i hadn't bought it as a package with sd cards and case i would have had to have added things
difficult to keep my finger from covering the 'pop-up' flash. this prevents the flash from rising to its full height. this does not stop the flash from working.
i found the battery is sometimes hard to remove and the cover over the usb points a bit fiddly.
the flash is in an inconvenient place. it pops up where my finger is to hold the camera. i just have to remember to hold it a different way when i need the flash.
zoom good but you have to hold the camera very still, tricky to do.
like almost all cameras of this type, there is no viewfinder - whatever the manufacturers claim, this is a serious problem with strong sunlight behind you. a delkin shade helps. the option of raw would have been welcome.
quite heavy and bulky, feels like it's more made for shooting landscape than people (which i am more interested in so a biased view)
a lot of people have been complaining about the flash popping up where you finger sits naturally when taking a picture, newsflash, move your finger and it wont get in the way!!! the only point i will bring up is the picture quality at maximum zoom isn't as clear as i was expecting, i think a tripod might sort this problem out though.
no eye view-finder
fingers can get in the way when flash pops up!
not having a printed manual .
have not yet found any.
im'e too stupid to use all the features
position of pop up flash.
hard to understand what and how to  adjust for manual settings
flash difficult to disable / too easily re-enabled.
more expensive than some alternatives, but for a reason.
flash pop up isnt comfortable while holding the camera holding the camera.
no booklet only online. problem getting anorhher battery
not found any yet
case is bad design.
shape and place of the buttons is not very ergonomic.
it is expensive
battery does not last long
difficult to focus at maximum telephoto ie. 2o mm you have to use tripod.
flash gets in way of your finger
flash popping up where hand is.
flash pops up from the top
not so good for moving pictures
bigger than my previous camera and heavier, but nothing i cant get used to.
it did not come with a case and the instructions are all on the web instead of in book form.
autofocus in live view mode isn't great... regularly struggles if the scene isn't 'simple' and even when it is working - can hunt around for a good two seconds before finding focus - so just stick to using its instant live view autofocus
limited only by one's imagination
shutter sound
leadtimes for deliveries. almost one month for such a product at this price !!!
continuous shoot could be better
quite expensive
so many features it takes time to find and remember the ones to use
il y a une rayure dans le viseur
no paper user manual
18-55mm lens could be better, wich i had paid the extra for the 18-135mm lens.  using 18-55 mm lens on video setting you can hear the sound of the lens constantly focussing on the recording.
no real bad points. auto focus on the supplied lens too noisy for movie mode (can't wait to get the 40mm stm pancake lens!).
can't see any.
i get colour fringing on unedited videos which i played straight from sd memory card. after i convert the video, there is no colour fringing problem at all. i dont know weather it is a bad point or not but just wanted to mention.
nothing wrong with the camera to date. the touch screen will need regular cleaning for live view. it is also the main centre for changing settings so it  means the lcd display is generally on. not sure what effect this will have on battery life in practice
lens autofocus noisy on video (not that i use it)
nothing stands out as a bad point on this camera that any other wouldn't have.
unable to use the view finder to take video, which would make framing easier and more accurate in bright sunlight because like all lcds they can be difficult to see at times, despite maximum light adjustment. lcd ok in less bright sunlight.
canon said they would send 4 dvds to help get me started! they sent one and it didn't teach me a thing, it just said what i could learn on their courses! grrrr! nice camera though!
not over keen on the live view....seems to a little cumbersome
only recently bought camera but to date have not found any bad points.
face recognition and tracking is only available using 'live view' with lcd screen and not through viewfinder but this is a minor issue.
auto focus when filing is a little noisy
may not be that much of an improvement over 550d/600d to warrant extra cost
long users manual with needed information to go through
video wb function is cumbersome; video button could do with a separate release cable to avoid camera movement
plastic
no zoom view on screen and screen could possibly be a little more robust, but time will tell.
expensive! but can't complain with 0% finance!
not come across any!
small buttons
complicated to use!!
difficult to print out at 380 pages long
no bad points
this can affect you if you are a video maker.
not found any
i would recommend that you purchase a supplementary book on how to get the best out of your canon 650d, its only been two weeks since the arrival of the camera and there is a lot to learn
auto focus by making movie
2) buttons can be easily bumped/pressed when your face is all up in the camera
night shooting
livraison trop long j'ai attendu 1 mois.
how about no
focus can be a bit slow in low contrast situations
nothing - this camera is brilliant.
does not feel as robust as it probably is
haven't found any as yet
feels a little plasticky, too many picture taking options on top dial (if you can have too many).
no lens hood as standard.
nit spoted any as yet
kit lens has a plasticky feel
lack of built in filter thread.
loss of variable screen over earlier models, but understand the compromises made.
parallax error through the view finder
menu's can be tricky to navigate without the manual
view finder dont show any information
a disadvantage of the fast lens is that it is reluctant to use flash when i want it to, but i will just have to play with the settings.  the box included a cd with a manual, but only in chinese!  however it is easy enough to find the pdf on the internet.
not compatible with other g series components
manual flash keeps catching me out as my g9 flash was auto.
grip good be better not much to hold on to, still it is a compact
still expensive. got mine cheaper as next model just out but it was a stretch
colour balance in certain artificial light situations could be easier to get right. sometimes menus not intuitive. no sd card provided.
not had it long enough to find any yet.
if you want a point and shoot camera don't bother. this can do that but you will miss the opportunity to take control and be creative.
can't think of any
the movie frame rate should be switchable between 25fps uk system to 30fps american system
you have a buy a separate book as no manual but no big deal bought an excellent guide for \xa315
not as good as the g12 because it does not have the directional viewing screen.
it was delivered with out a paper manual! im sure its a very good camera but its difficult to figure out with out a paper manual.
as above
even if this compact is the best i found, still the quality of the pictures are far from slr (d800)
non
haven't found anything yet. only small point is that the charging plug on my camera is a bit micky mouse. it comes as a multi plug option which i think may be because the camera isnt from uk stock.
fiddly controls
does not include a wrist strap.
poor optical viewfinder
optical viewfinder.
-
quite heavy.
no hard copy manual
haven't really found any yet - sorry, but it's just a fab happy snapper.
the elv only extends through the optical zoom range.  initially, i found  the menu complicated ( i'm a slow learner ) but i'm learning. the auto and p settings are excellent if needed.
perhaps a little on the heavy side for a compact camera but that is a very minor complaint.
price
no information in oprtical viewfinder gives this limited value and i haven't used it as much as i expected - perhaps an evf would be better in the next model.
i have not yet discovered any
don\xb4t know yet but the cover for lens seems pretty thin so carry case would be recommended to protect cover from taking hits.
no paper manual - it is hopeless to have to consult the computer every time you want to check how to do something.  this is a big minus.00
fairly bulky.  not a particularly long zoom.
view finder is vital for me, so better if at least some information is shown in it.
no printed manual
only drawback is power button...... it sits exactly where i rest my index finger when not shooting..... inconvenient but manageable.
5 x zoom against the previous g9 i owned which had 6 x
pushing it into a tight pocket can accidentally rotate some of the dials on top, so when you pull it out to take a quick shot expecting it to be on  'auto' it may be on portrait, and the exposure compensation on +2 for example.  not a major issue, but check before you shoot.
manual focus point
view finder too small should be rectangular.
big
internal flash seems a little weak/underpowered.
heavy
having so many dials and modes takes getting used to before being able to use the camera effectively.
le viseur , pas de porte filtre sur l'objectif
no manual only a cd very frustrating to a new photographer
we heard something and difficult to get out
lack of functions in video mode, lens noise when zooming in video mode, no microphone input
manual centre spot focusing still difficult to master/use
expensive, but compares well with other cameras in this range.
still just looks like an entry level dslr. still tying to figure out if it can do single point af.
objectif cher + bruit du declencheur pas tjr discret
hi,why mmy canon eos 650 d have 10 digit serial number,rest cameras canon 650 d have 12 digit serial number.please answer for my question.this is fake?
body's is a fair bit larger bare that in mind (bags are a pain). touch screen feature is great but smudges really easily. carry around a screen wipe. also difficult to see in bright sunlight due to glare.
not particularly robust
not found any yet
this particular kit does not have the image stabilised lens (which is why it is a bit cheaper)
but i suppose some economies needed to be made to keep price down. the instruction manual is printed in very small type face and is not the easiest manual i have ever read, however there are pleanty of online tutorials.
cant think of any
night shots are good , wont say excellent.
camera is bulky, however, i knew this when i purchased it! i also felt a little intimidated with all it's buttons etc, however, i brought myself a dummies guide to eos 1100d. lastly, again this is no fault to the camera directly, however, be warned once you buy a product of this kind you do end up buying 'extras' battery, sd card, which all adds up!
sporty photo shoots can't be done properly with this. although shutter speed is good but motion detection is not that much good. hence photo becomes blurry. night potrait system has same problem.
lens has some silver strip between the moving parts which is peeling loose. had to superglue that badboy back in! also, sometimes trouble with auto-focusing in very low light.
only 720p video.
not found any yet
looking at the design, i'm sure canon could have made the lcd screen larger. these are only niggles!!
no bad points, apart from its an older model might have a few difficulties selling it off later on when upgrading to another model
can't think of any.
makes you want to spendall your cash on lenses
i will have to buy a lens cap that i can attach to the camera as the lens cap on this camera doesn't have a string attachment and i keep dropping it from force of habit! that is the only drawback i have come across!
has a plasticy feel but doesn't distract from use.
i would like a carrying case to come with it.
quite heavy
auto focus sometimes doesn't work properly
the lcd screen is a tiny bit on the small side.
no bad points just yet!
would prefer if the lens cap was attached to the camera as it has been misplaced on more than one occasion.
you can get some cheap lens of ebay to get you started like i did
quite a light weight build.
autofocus in liveview, battery...... :(
the features are great so it is a bit pointless if you only intend to use the auto function.
compared to the more expensive canons it feels a little bit plastic, but not to bad
no comment.
no carry case
n-o-n-e
no bad points about this product.
battery charge could be better.
struggling to find any apart from lack of full hd video, but if like me you are happy to live without it a very good buy
unable to change colours on the camera itself (eg, to black and white).
haven't found any yet.
cant reduce pixels at camera level
limited zoom means having to buy additional lense straight away
the shutter is loud, not an issue for most things but can be for wildlife shots.
objectif trop limit\xe9
fault after 4 - 5 days unable to resolve
hard to find protective bag to put camera in.
interface isn't overly intuitive. going 'back' for instance within a menu isn't easy..
don't like smooth finish could be made to look more leather like
haven't found any yet
no camera case
for the price
memory card included
can't find any till this moment.
change between single and multi shot is a bit slow
see above!
where i bought it from
only 12 megapixels, but the pictures still look good, but haven't printed any yet though
it is hard to turn on some features. the menu takes a while to get used to and is not totally intuitive at times.
daunting amount of indicators on display if trying out manual operations.  feels a bit weighty.  can be a bit noisy when taking a shot (clacking sound) particularly when in a theatre!
i haven't really found anything i'd identify as a 'bad point', although i accept what some reviewers have said about the camera maybe feeling a little 'plasticky' (sic0 in build.  but so far that hasn't worried me.
havent found any yet
the kit lens is good for the initial pics but soon you'll be after a 'proper' one! consider buying wihout any lens and buying a better one from the outset.
non i have found up to now.
noe
transfer of video to computer, some files get corrupted. visual then judders and stalls on playback whilst sound is unhindered. however this is not on all transfers.
flash is broken
so many features it's impossible to remember all of them
connecting to wifi is cumbersome
possibly a bit too small and battery life isnt too impressive.
following instructions as to how to utilise wifi -  still not mastered it
2) if you want to embed gps data into your photos and video then you need to have your smart phone with you and remember to activate the app before you take your shot which is ridiculous.
a lot of functions to learn (but that's not that bad
the position of the pop-up flash is irritating! it's right where the fingers of your left hand rest.
flash position,  pops under your finger, but you'll get used to i
gps and wireless not intuitive and the small size of the camera, is both an advantage and disadvantage, particularly if you have large hands.
noise of zoom
flash position its a pity
wifi a little fiddly
not really...
a bit on the expensive side, but considering you are getting video (*.mov format) at 1080p for up to 29.59min max at one shot, its a lot better than carrying around two cameras
pay attention to full card: i have lost all my pictures because when the card is full, the camera can't read the card and want the user to reformat the card...just don't full the card!
would have expected such an expensive piece of hardware to have at least a soft case for initial protection as well as a small memory card so ot could be used straight out of the box, neither of which were provided
haven't found any
not encountered any yet.
video mode picks up lens focus noise and there is no provision for an external microphone.  this can be overcome by investing in a canon ultrasonic lens - a costly solution...
my canon 300 400 all use cf memory cards for which i own a number of high quality rather expensive cf memory cards.  now i have to start over again to purchase high quality sdhc/sd memory cards.  the quality of the basic kit lens (18-55mm) is well below the expected quality of a canon lens.  the slower frame rate to achieve hd video.  lack of an external mike output.
standard lens has some color abaration on edges, can fix in processing
kit lens is very light and plasticy with average image quality.
kit zoom very mediocre quality - have bought cheap 50mm 1.8 lens and results are far superior.
some features are not adequately explained on screen (and don't have an obvious effect) so reference must be made to the manual.
battery does not last long before requiring recharge
shutter sound a little loud for wildlife shots.
1080p hd slow frame rate - ok for landscapes but 720p better for moving objects. better still buy a canon dedicated hd video camera
cant think of any bad points at all. i've had the camera for 3 weeks and enjoyed every shot!
should not be considered as an alternative to a movie camera as its facilities to shoot hd movie are limited.
no bad points
i haven't found any so far.
no dvd tutorial available to help you master the controls,and give you confidence to progress.
i would of preferred more easier control options in the menu, although in auto its self explanitory, having a few extr settings like on the sony a330 would of been nice
haven't found any yet. the only slightly negative commetn to make would be that the camera didn't come with a memory card and you cannot take images without one.
can't find any yet.
can't think of any.have always been a huge fan of canon!
cropped sensor, but as are all models in this range so this point should not be a problem, lens end rotates when focussing, so no fade filter can be used easily, this can all be done easier in post anyway.
bit confusing at first, getting on to jpg instead of raw, but once done, no problems
video and live mode focussing is slow.
why dont camera manufactures supply cards?even a 1gb would get you started.
the white balance and iso settings in full automatic mode do not always give the best results. better used in programme ae mode than auto.
haven't found any yet
no card included and standard lens gives good quality pictures but feels a bit cheep.
kit lens build quality is not great, but certainly adequate.
non
the lens fitted on the camera package however is fairly limited so i intend purchasing a telephoto lens at a later date.
currently still a tad pricey
the mode dial. need to get rid of the easy modes and just have the pasm modes.
the lens it comes with is not fantastic so i would recommend anyone buying this to get a bigger lens with the pack when they buy it.  the shutter function is also quite noisy but these ar small points for an excellent camera
sometimes buffers a bit so can't take another pic quickly
video mode isn't great (only 20fps at 1080p)
no movable screen(can't adjust the screen)
the grip could be a little bigger, it's a little unconfortable to hold it due to it's size. the functions could be more easily adjustadble with more dials.
video not doing autofocus
has only 9 af points against 11 in nikon d5000
basic lenses ar ok but can be soft at full aperture. don't think camera would survive knock - quite plasticy.
price but i always wish things were cheaper!
did not encounter any yet
can't think of any at the moment
instruction manual not very clear in one or two places. some of the switches/buttons are very small
may be over-complicated for beginners
can't find any for the moment.
plastic body- could be more robust
the price is too high.
in past have had difficulties with damp getting into canon cameras-hence need to replace
more plasticy appearance and feel compared with my eos 300 35mm camera
i miss the 'extra' features avaliable on the powershot cameras...
not found any as yet!
feel about it but no problems with the build quality so far.
camera bag is coming unstiched on front pocket even though hardly anything put in there
should have small individual fitted case with it a standard.

still learning about it, but haven't discovered any problems yet.  canon reduced the rrp a couple of weeks after i bought the camera!
on off switch very small
not found any yet.
the supplied strap is covered with logos (thats a bit of a personal bugbear) and not the most comfortable thing on the neck.
rear screen much improved though still difficult to see in bright light - hoped it would be better.
it is'nt free.
on/off switch difficult when mounted on a tripod
takes some time to learn the more specialised features.  will probably still be learning in 12 months time
haven't found any yet.
can't think of any.
the video option is missing

a little heavy but that's about it
on off switch looks a bit flimsy.
as i expected it is heavier and have therefore had to invest in a new sturdier bag to carry it and my equipment over a period of time. i expected this though and do not see it being a problem.
non really
heavy....but you get what you pay for
cannot find any
perhaps could have easier access to some of the menus and facilities
had to buy compact flash cards as my 450d used sd's, no big problem though
non
on far to many times i find that this dial has moved, and now have to check every time that the setting has not been moved...................very poor showing here canon
, people who want this should buy a simlple compact.
haven't found any.
not enough time to use it
non e so far
digital noise very poor on relatively low iso
takes a bit of getting used to in order to get the best from it
- fiddly on/off switch.
no
still doesnt take sd cards
graining  at high iso levels is slightly worse then what i expected, although  can be easely compensated with adobe lightroom
lack of movie mode may be a problem for some.
my flash not working !!!
not so keen on where the on off switch is - prefer it to be more accessible - but that's the only negative thing i can say so far
no bad points.
as yet, i haven't a great deal of negativity to share with you all. i thought it might take a while to get to know all the features and therefore not get any good pics but this is not the case.
can be a little bit noisey at high iso, but this is fixable by exposing correctly and is quite easily remedied is photoshop.
more things to learn!
nothing son far
the on/off switch is awkward to use.
body material feels like cheap plastic but lightweight.
point considering the price and level of this camera. i mean, you can't ask much more from an entry-level dslr.
very noisy when the live view turns off, so far this is the only negative point.
film setting awkward to use, but works fine andtakes good quality hd movies
difficult to use focus ring on lens when lcd screen is rotated out, could just be something to get used to doing.
a little heavy
no real bad points other than it can be quite expensive to get quality lenses to go with it.
isn't quite what i expected and is quite difficult to control focus.  same applies for the hd movie mode.  part of me wishes it was a mag/ali case rather than plastic but the price hike to the next model up was just too much.
only minor issue is the slow frames per sec. could have done with being a bit quicker but i can live with that the the relatively low price paid.
can't think of any just now but i may find something one of these days.....just love the camera to bits
make sure you buy class 6 or above sdhc cards (doesn't mention it in the manual anywhere; using auto-focus in live view mode is difficult - the lense keeps hunting, so switch to manual; manual focus is a bit tricky when the screen's out wide to the left
only manual focus on video.
1
no
no pc connection
non really only two weeks use so far though.
can't think of any.
live view is just about acceptable.
the drive mode could be faster-a bit laboured at times. would prefer iso settings to be at 1/3rd stop increments rarther than the full stop increment.  but these are fairly minor quibbles
it wasn't clear to me that no lens was included, so i had to purchase a lens separately.
nothing really given the price point.
feels a bit plasticy.
different batteries to 40 d range a real pain had to buy another spare. the accessory fittings are different also to 40d range so accessories won't fit this camera, particularly studio lights, so has been a night mare sorting out the extra's i needed before i could start shooting again. all this they don't tell you before you buy!
not found any yet.
plastic casing
the tamron lens is not well suited to floral/insect macros. it,'s a basic lens more designed for entry level widelife photography but provide good introduction to zoom lens usage.
bag is not very good, i bought a different one within days.
if you're going to offer a bundle then make sure the bag comfortably carries both items.... i'll probably end up buying another bag. not a showstopper but a little more thought about putting a bundle together is needed.
a bit on the pricey side but i got a good deal online
with some many features you have got your work cut out in terms of getting the most out of what this camera can do. the best way forward would be to attend a 3 day course as it's difficult going through the hand book and to be honest we perfer to play than read!!
difficult to criticise. metal body would be great and smaller f-stops but then the price also rockets so great value for what it provides.
i just havent found any yet.
haven't found any so far.
the raw format is not standard on older packages, such as my 5 year old photoshop and new serif photoplus x4.  ms.net has been corrupted on my pc and so the eos utility won't work.  i have to convert from canon cs2 to dng.
never got item
trying to get it back from my 11 year old grandson he thinks its ace but no bad points
fitting the lenses and camera in the bag.!
not the cheapest option around.  went for the twin lens option but the bag won't hold both of them - so need another one.
it feel a little bit plasticky, just a little bit though.
shoot user, as fully auto modes do not always give the best results that the camera is capable of.
the one thing i would change would be the place of the flash as when turning the camera on i find my finger gets in the way so it doest pop open. but it can be lifted manualy.
not too impressed with the loss of 3mp when you activate wide-angle shooting, but 9mp still gives a crisp enough images for photos of friends.
as i have only just purchased the camera my only complaint is regarding the instructions only being found on the dvd.  as a new user it is very helpful to have the information readily available without having to open up ones computer.  you can't easily carry a dvd player on holiday, certainly not for the majority of people.  i would have willingly payed more for the approx 206 pages.
.
as mentioned by many others the flash is a bit awkward. it's easy enough to stop it popping up when you turn the camera on, but if it transpires that you actually need it you have to turn off and on again (unless there's something that i haven't figured out yet). nothing bad enough to outshine the other excellent features.
instruction manual distinctly lacking in info so doubt i am currently getting the best out of the features, all of which i am still trying to find.
pop up flash irritating
i bought the leather case as i felt the camera needed protection as i tend to carry it in my handbag.
nothing much
flash opening every time you switch on camera
flash is in wrong place but it doesnt worry you, just push it down if you dont need it, apart from that minor issue the camera is great
you need 5 presses of buttons to delete a photo, sometimes slow when saving however might be due to the memory card.
would prefer a better manual rather than printing out disc from pc.
one of the bad points is the location of the flash, this is where you would hold the camera. also the flash pops up when you turn the camera on.
battery life
i would like a wrist strap in case it was knocked out of my hand or i lost grip.
one small screw missing but overall very good build quality.
no arbitrary exposure time.
haven't found any yet...
annoying pop up flash
have a tendency to over compensate in low light.
battery life short (get a spare), colours in pics sometimes not quite right, not sure why
not so easy to use with just one hand
lacks direct vision veiwfinder
menu can take a little while initially to get to learn
to open the battery compartment is not allways easy
battery life perhaps a little lacking but a spare battery soves that quite easily.
maybe the the downside would be the pop up flash,it should have been integrated into the camera,
flash is in a bad place gets in way when trying to take pics
holding the camera to take a photo - finger sometimes holds down the flash which prevents it from functioning properly.
zoom function takes some getting used to, battery doesnt last as long as would like so i may get a spare
there is a lot to read if you want to get the most out of the digital camera, and the manual only comes on cd-rom.
no internal memory.flash pops up automatically.lens cover needs to be adjusted
flash pops out right on the position where you hold the camera
* build in flash badly located and pops up on power on, even not needed.
w with your choice of selections and another just 1 button away which is full 1080p 2:3...
i would echo most of the previously revues, like the silly pop-up flash evry time you power the camera. the worst criticism i found it to be the recording button, far to small and i was experiencing difficulties engaging at the first attempts, with the opposite happening if lightly brushed against it.
the pop up flash is a bit clunky and pops up where i like to hold the camera.
flash positioning
it also has so many features it's quite hard to negociate all the menus, esp. when you are in a hurry
i am still having problems with the software supplied, it is a pity you cannot supply a better user guide in paper form.
delete function a bit complicated.
pictures taken at night or in darker rooms can sometimes come out less impressive compared to pictures taken in day light.
just the flash popping up, but can live with that.
nothing to write home about
battery life
flash rises at natural hold point, but you soon get used to it.
pop up flash needs finger over it to stop it always trying to open.
no bad points so far
you tend to have your finger over the flash unit when it pops up as you switch the camera on.
unable to think of any.
viewer dark in bright conditions mov vidios i could not play back on pc
can be abit akward the buttons to do at speed
difficult to navigate without comprehensive instructions. the camera needs to come with a book!
auto mode sets iso often too high
errr... no case for camera.
i prefer cameras where you can recharge the battery within the camera rather than using separate charger dock. that option means one cable and not chargers and more cables
some people have mentioned the flash button rising as soon as the camera switches on - yes it does, but so what? - just hold your finger over it.  if that is all wrong, then goe an buy this camera.  you will not be disappointed.
also when i chose black and white pics on the screen you could hardly see the pics.

although the full 1080p hd video mode is fantastic, when playing back movies (when the optical zoom has been used during filming) you can hear the slight noise of the mechanics working the zoom. otherwise, i don't have anything against the camera!
very poor autofocus in low light, a lot of the time it would refuse to focus at all,  a big let down for an otherwise good little compact
position of flash light
minor usability issues, e.g. over-sensitive scroll wheel and must restart camera to enable flash once closed. ideally, raw shooting would be supported, but i wouldn't expect this in a typical compact!
position of flash is where you put your index finger. the small flap that covers the hdmi /mini usb sockets is of poor design and i suggest will fail with repeated use (plastic and tiny lugs that look fragile)
silly pop up flash everytime you switch it on - why?
flash is built in where you would usually hold the camera, tok a while to understand how to use all the different settings.
must remember to keep fingers away from pop up flash when turning on. lens cover very flimsy, looking for suitable lens cap.
flash pops up when turn on
cashback has not arrived.
flash opens up eqch time camera fired up.  nothing significant.
not as cheap as many similar cameras although the good points probably make it worth it.
not found any yet
having to manually raise flash.  sometimes the moment has passed for the photo by the time you manually raise the flash.  could a button be inbuilt to carry out this process.
not having a hard copy manual
non interchangeable lens but then don't really need to
lack of viewfinder but you get used to it.
surprisingly, canon uk were unable to tell me the thread size for hood, filter, etc or where to obtain a case
a very comprehensive set of options is a big task to learn when the instructions are on a cd.
en fran\xe7ais, j'ai re\xe7u un batterie avec un chargeur munie d'une prise non fran\xe7aise (japonaise?). quand vous livrez en france, vous devez livrer des produits \xe9quip\xe9s de prises francaises!!!!
haven't had time to find out yet only had it for christmas
in dark light the display looks very fuzzy. all the instructions were in chinese.

read the manual first otherwise you will be wondering what all the controls do!

if i had to be picky i spose the screen is difficult to see in strong light and the protectors are a bit fiddly. but this would almost certainly be the same on most cameras.
no cable for connecting to view pics on tv screen
screen protectors included are useless. no point in shipping them, better of with another cheapie add on if they could swap it.
user manual on disk so difficult to flip quickly through pages.
not had time to use it enough yet for a thorough appraisal
smooth plastic body lets it down
maybe i'm just getting to old to enjoy gagets.
no complaints.
doesn't have a timer.
lots of features to understand
depth of field is a difficult one to master...but that's probably not the fault of the camera....rather the operator..
still looking for something to complain about. being very 'picky' - the menu navigation takes a bit of concentration but once you are used to it everything progresses quite smoothly.
locks up on continuous shooting when in raw file mode
unclear menu
live mode is poor, unusable in low contrast conditions
still cant quite grasp live mode yet.
weight.
bit plasticky, robustness in bad weather.
not really a semi-pro camera
weight
live view is not very well implemented but useable.
flash not good
a bit chunky
although it's small, it could be improved to be lighter and smaller still, but otherwise i'm pretty happy with the camera.
menus a little difficult to get used to. battery life seems quite short
flash a little weak, a little difficult to learn to use especially if it was a first digital camera for someone
doesn't quite fit into my pocket!
i don't like the build quality
there aren't any really.  i took the time to find a camera that would suit my needs and this was the one that had all the features necessary to fill my requirements, with some to spare.
the engravings on the function switch are very small and difficult to read in anything but good light
the only awkward bit can be opening and closing the battery compartment - it sometimes doesn't seem to close fully but it really doesn't constitute a major problem
given as a present, therefore unable to comment on specifics. same the word refurbished was given such prominence on the packaging.
heavy on battery power
i would have liked a camera case with it.
not very good at night time pictures
have not as yet found any bad points
had to read the book before use had to buy card extra
the battery cover feels a bit filmsy.  some small scratches on the screen, but only visible with the camera off.  then again it is a refurb so didn't expect it to be perfect.
there really aren't any valid criticisms. the manufacturers, canon, have clearly put a lot of thought into the design and functionality of this item.
one or two features short of the competition but quality makes up for quantity
like most canons the battery dies without warning, there is no indication of the battery level but the battery life is quite long so not too much of a problem.
any
image can be blurry, though that may be me having not learned to use it properly!
can't say i have had any bad points about it.
low battery indicator does not give enough notice before camera dies!
dedicated print button might be put to better use - iso settings perhaps.
a bit heavy for a point and shoot.  no raw format.  iso should have a dedicated button.
yet to find any bad points.
it didn't ome with a case.
not good for use indoors - picture quality is affected
haven't came across any yet
optical veiwfinder
small print in the instruction
screen resolution is a little less than expected.  why do canon insist on placing a button on the camera for direct printing?  who does that?  surely it would have been better used a direct command button for iso or shot size.
shoot at this price.
there are a lot of features that need to be studied at length to get the hang of.
find the battery and card cover difficult to open.  i previously had a canon powershot a70 which was more accessible.
no serious bad points except it uses different card technology (sd card) which means that if upgrading from an earlier model (eg a75 or a95) the compact flash card cannot be used.
slightly bulky
no bad points
cycle time between frames is rubbish - it was advertised as being the best arround but i'm missing pictures because of the lag
no image stabiliser so images taken during night are little blurred
a bit heavy.
image noise in clear blue skies (to many megapixels on the sensor), a 6 to 7 megapixel sensor would have been more sensible.
bit bulky
there are no bad points, if the camera does what you expect of it, there can't be any !
indoor non flash pictures with people still limited in quality, the aperture and shutter speed options aren't immediately obvious to use and play with.
it's a bit of a fiddle to change iso settings, aperture override etc. but gets easier with time. it tends to use the flash too often for my liking, but you can easily turn the flash off. i find i can hold it steady enough to take quite long exposures without blurring.
can't think of any.

no battery meter, can be a pause between pressing for the picture and the picture actually been taken
cheap silver plastic bits let the product design down.
only supplied with basic user-guide.advanced manual only on software-inconvenient for checking techniques whilst out in the field.it took 3 letters-the final one to the md of canon-to obtain a printed version.
it doesn't allow charging via usb and the battery flap is far to fragile.
trying to find a case this small is hard.
nothing bad at the moment that i can say.
lcd monitor difficult to see in bright sunlight
standard memory card is pathetic, needs at least 2gb
haven't really found any to speak of as yet.
after 1 month of use still haven't found any bad points yet.
kit lens can be soft at times
on auto the iso may no shift much from 400 iso.
the lens is poor. but ok. in my opinion the first thing to do is get a better lens. ie 28mm to 105mm usm lens. using a good quality lens on this camara gives a professional look to the camara and the pictures.
can't stop taken photos
the solutions disc free memory card did not arrive. i feel a bit miffed over that
can underexpose if you don't pay close attention to the scene and watch out for highlights.  high iso performance only average and quite poor if you underexpose high iso shots.  kits lens is optically ok, but the build quality of the kit lens is *horrible*!
non
not many bad points just i little bit small in your hand
havent found any yet
it would be nice if it came with a memory card. so for the price of a camera, you can start taking pictures.
the manual lacking of info
built in flash can be a little tempremental at times.
makes you spend more money on new lenses, filters, memory cards, cleaning products and the like!
very difficult to obtain a mains ac adaptor for the camera. managed to get round this problem, using a card reader and then linking my pc through my cannon selphi printer.
kit lens is not great, suffers from quite a lot of distortion at the wide angle end of the zoom range.
kit lens quality shown not to be the best as i was advised prior to buying. if you've the money buy the body with a better quality lens.
unable to get cash back. on line form closes before it can be completed. right address not available to send by post.
battery life can be a little too short, but ok  overall
it's not possible to crop pictures on the lcd and then to save them.  quite a drawback if you don't have the time to fiddle around on the computer.
no bad points.
no built in image stabilisation
nothing - totally happy.
only niggle i have is the view-finder window seems very deep set. so you have to really look inside to get at the shot info.
the basic lens quality could be better. no imaging stabiliser option incorporated.
manual is more complicated than an old fashioned slr.
software package is excellent
lens that comes with it is only average and limits more sophisticated photography for those who are more experienced photographers.
size......it is not somethng you can just put in your handbag, also i wish it did video's, but you cant have everything
pentamirror not as good as a pentaprism so view finder not as bright.
memory cards can be a pain, dont buy a high gb card
a bit smaller than i'm used to
there is nothing i don't like about the eos400d
better if it had used aa type batteries- other than that a very good buy.
flash unit rattles when stored - disconcerting.
extraction of flash card from its camera seating could be a lot better.
the cheapest decent canon lens is more than i paid for the camera body. images have a slightly 'soft' look to them. lack of live view. the camera defaults to aperture settings that give the theoretical best results without consideration of the exposure time. consequently, unless you are in good sunlight, using a tripod or have a very large aperture lens you need to pay constant attention to the exposure time to ensure that the images are sharp. this is worst in the pre-defined modes.  it means that for point and shoot results it actually gives inferior results to my nikon coolpix 7900 digital compact.  fine if you really set up every shot properly though.  to be honest i have been a little dissapointed by this as my first foray into dslrs.
i would like to see it weather proofed.
right-angle viewfinder and remote release would be a great help to me but they are far too expensive for me to justify the spend.
no real bad points. however, if the user is only using a camera for the odd snap shot i feel there are more suitable cameras on the market, for a fraction of the cost. this particular camera needs the user to study the instructions carefully to get the best results. not the right camera for occasional use. this camera needs to be used regularly for best results.
(though both the above are sumountable when using the advanced settings)
.  we had an unexpected total system failiure which due to the vageries of the warranty system resulted in a long repair yet having only recently purchased it the body should have been replaced automatically for the sake of peace of mind.
quite heavy
too many features - maybe some peopla will use them, but i probably need only a tiny fraction.
sometimes difficult to setup to your current surroundings
although the build quality is quite good i would prefer the body to be of metal.
lack of spot meter.  lack of b setting when controlled from computer (software limitation can be overcome using a manual release cable).  hydrogen alpha line filtered out along with infra red so insensitive when photographing galaxies.
screen could do with a protector like with pda screens youcan buy thin plastic coatings that you can add to ensure no scratches etc.
a thick manual to read through which is neccessary.
depth of field preview doesn't really reflect the end photo
no major issues that i have yet found other than the small handgrip for fellas - perfect for me though!  would have liked the option of being able to use a slower iso than 100.
body bit small for large hands, manual flash button position
large files are huge in comparison to nikon therefore i go through alot more flash cards on jobs.
slightly small, but this is fixed by purchasing the battery grip.
flash pop up is a little over sensative
no preview of image on lcd screen
no internal memory; poor case (bought separately); complicated for digital beginners; limited lens; limited flash which jumps open when necessary with too much vibration; some buttons difficult to reach.
the grip is too small for my hands - more suitred to a female. the hand grip is also made of hard plastic which is harder to grip than a rubberised grip.
still got dust on sensor,
lack of viewing the subject on the lcd prior to shooting. a big minus this.
the lens that comes with the camera is not very good, as the pictures aren't very sharp.
lenses so expensive
built in flash -- would be better with zoom linked to lens zoom
manuel a bit hard to understand
build quality not as good as my nikon but not far away. if i was honest my nikon cost allot more money.
15-55 standard lens not really enough, could do with up to 85 or 100
have not found any yet!
nothing to bother me.
maybe a touch too small for some in size. lots of plastic in construction, but still quite robust. red eye reduction feature only works with flash unit up. (would have been better to utilise the front led on camera body)
standard lens is a bit restrictive (18-55mm) so additional lens essential. however, this range of lens appears to be standard accross most manufacturers
the kit-lense is adequate, but you will quickly want to go and buy many replacements. it's not a very slow lense, and the auto-focus is annoyingly poor in the dark.
it gets a little heavy after a while.
it has got a light body, which means its hard to control with heavy lens.
standard 18-55mm lens feels a little light and not as robust as i'd like.
yet to find any!
i am used to seeing the photograph on the monitor and it took some time to get used to only using the see through lens.
picture quailty could be a little sharper,
remote shutter not included
soft looking photos, but can just sharpen post process
very noisey shutter. lack of live view via lcd.
i can not think of any bad points!
expensive lenses.
could have a bit better zoom.
getting everything right is not as easy as it looks and there are some superb compact digitals on the market now which are almost as good as entry-level digital slrs and are relatively easy to use.
didn't come with a memory card so couldn't be used out of the box..?
a bit plasticy
no free case.
as you get the battery grip with this package it would have been nice to have had two batteries to go with it rather than have to go and buy a second one.
camera weight for me is heavy with zoom lenses fitted.
lens should be better for distances
nothing really.
no separate monitor for viewing
the supplied kit lense is not bad at all but a more experience photographer will notice it's minor flaws, so a body only kit may be the better option and let them choose their own lense.
flash is a little sensitive and pops up more than i would expect in daylight conditions
a couple of the controls are in a location where they can be accidentally activated, but i haven't found anything to make me say this is less than a great, versatile camera.
2. i (and many artists would like to be able to print the image with the grid but i don't think this is possible. give canon a nudge please.
grip could be a bit bigger for bigger hands but not really an issue.
poor build quality of standard lens
i have'nt found any as yet
why they do not include a proper spot metering option?  have to get the 450d for this which is stupid.  my last compact had it!
slow to focus
not easy to set up for photography in the snow.
life of battery
no spot metering
would benefit from more buttons which could be assigned to functions by the user.
the side catch to access e.g. remote shot point is a bit flimsy
software takes up loads of memory space on my laptop
a little small to hold - i preferred the slightly larger size of the 300d
exposes lower quality lenses - the eos300d 18-55 kit lens is not particularly impressive with this camera.
changing settings for example focus points, iso etc. is much slower than on my canon 5d.
yet to find any !
whilst using the camera outdoors on fully automatic mode pictures tend to be quite dark.
have to take battery out to re-charge. is there a docking station? any way of re-charging via usb link?
nothing much
the software is a little difficult to use without in depth study.
doesn't have any
standard lens
the one bad point that i feel i should rise is the very basic manual. i am quite lucky that i also bought a canon 400d handbook with it.
no live view
bit expensive
not strong enogh flash
difficult to find some of the features, what they do etc.  perhaps a manual /help could be available in the window on the camera?
you need some basic photographic knowledge to get the best from the camera
malfunctioned after one week and had to be returned
it is not the canon 450d. but that is ok!
photo software could be better
too bulky.
i have had difficulty getting the macro function to focus properly, but need to spend more time with it as i am sure it is fairly straightforward.
older canon lense filters don't fit.
small to hold safely with a heavy lens. battery pack is essential and i don't have large hands!
availability of affordable zoom lens
would have been adventageous to have a 'live' image screen to set up shote rather than having to use the viewfinder
lens felt much poorer quality than camera. `noise suppression` overstated.
standard package lens could be a little more sophisticated
the instruction booklet is small , therefore difficult to read. there is also an assumption about the degree of knowledge that one already has as to the variables that can be altered when using the camera.
need to buy loads of accessories - supplied lens okay
manual focusing on the standard lens is not worth using.
can take some time to get used to, and images can sometimes be slightly under exposed.
no viewing screen image before taking the picture
no raw image capture?
heavy, bulky
images are a little soft, but they sharpen up well in the digital darkroom
image quality is good but often needs a bit of photoshop tweaking to get the best out of the camera.
have not really found any bad points
doesn't seem as robust as my previous canon slrs.
crashes occassionally
the manual is not that easy to follow
slightly plastic feel
canon lens expensive
i don;t photos with the kit lens as sharp as with a 300d
quite small and light for a dslr, though that may be a plus for some, if you have big hands it can feel a bit tiny!
not much to complain about, could be cheaper to add diferent lens, extra flash etc
automatic light assessment not as good as i would have hoped with complicated backgrounds; downloading prints and computer program not intuitive
would like to be able to pre-view picture on lcd display. some control buttons a little fiddley. can't always see the led readout in the view finder.
in built flash could be stronger
it would have been nice to have had the chance to upgrade some of the products
i found the cannon lens included in the package to be disappointing the build does not feel good. however it does take nice close up's and the tamron lens included makes up for the canon's shortfall
it's automatic colour and / or white balance seems to make some pictures look worse rather than better. but not too bad as this can soon be sorted out in cs2 or psp etc.
seems haevier on the batteries than our last digital camera.
battery consumption has been huge - not sure why
only the difficulty seeing the display on very sunny days which is why i bought a camera with a viewfinder to compensate.
i did have trouble opening the battery compartment to begin with, i still find this a bit of a fiddle.
on/off  switch is a button --that is fiddly to use a sliding switch would be better !
feels a little flimsy
shame about the plastic body...
a little on the large size
not a rechargable have to use batteries; not good
the camera is very flimsy. the battery flap and side where the pc cable goes into need a little care when handling...as you feel they may break! apart from that the camera is an all rounder!
luckily this didn't damage the camera.
i don't thing this camera has any bad points, the only thing would be that it doesn't have 10 megapixel, but the quality of the foto's are good enough for me! this camera is made for people who like photgraphing but are not very technik, you can do a lot with the camera and it's very easy!
sometimes the various menus can be a bit confusing
unable to zoom in movie mode
could do with an image stabliser.
uses aa batteries, not rechargable.  lag time between depressing shutter and the camera being ready to take another photo takes more time than desirable.
no case or memory card this added to the price and was therefore not as cheap as i had originally thought
no image stabilisation and found the viewer gave a different perspective to the lcd screen
i haven't found any
because i so enjoy canon products, its difficult for me to say anything bad about this camera. its almost impossible to take a bad picture with it! its my second one
not so good in very bright light, and the autoflash comes on a little too often
only pc pictbridge output on usb, unlike all other cameras of this type, which let the used selrect the output type.
no manual overide
lack of frame in viewfinder. inability to easily lock focus at infinity
needs expensive software upgrade to get most out of new raw format.
the kit lens is a bit slow f4-f5.6.  i'd have liked a faster one, but can't afford it at present.
parts of the manual can be pretty difficult to follow - i would recommend a 3rd party guide in addition
monitor (without zooming in). if you are planning on shooting wide then you will definately need a better lens for this purpose.
as the 350d but a good step forward.
the usb connection port is a little awkward to plug your cable into
nothing found to really irritate me yet.
kit lents quite poor on low and high endgs, a little bit blurry pictures at crop when sharpness set to 0.
the reality of moving from a high end compact digital camera to full size dslr means you also have to think about your photography. i used to have a 35mm slr (om2 sp) for around 10 years and then moved to compact cameras, then into digital photography with high end compact camera's. these return excellent results for simple snaps largely because of the processing and intelligence in the camera. buy a dslr and while it can also do some of these things you are buying it mainly so you have full control. what you don't realise is now you have to work and think to take a great picture. the camera does not compensate for you. something you don't realise when you switch back into serious photography having left it 15 yrs ago. not a fault with the camera, but something that we may not think about. anyway no regrets on purchasing decision.
awkward on/off switch - it is so fiddly
no hdmi, average lcd screen.
power switch  a bit fiddly especially with cold fingers.
not so much a bad point but a change from the previous model in terms of formatting the card.
it would be handy to have a live view button on the body itself, rather than having to go through the menus. the live view is a little complicated to use effectively.  the kit lens is probably more basic than i would expect for the money - it's good that it has is, but is not fabulous in low light.
pc software supplied didn't work properly, had to download updates for 5 programs from cannon site. your nose touches the lcd display when you take a photo, leaving a greasy screen, ergonomics are ok but could be a bit better. difficult to decide which additional lenses to buy, few obvious upgrades.
no specific canon case for this model.thats it !
dust
cheaper if brought with camera
non as yet
not much to say really, 10 mega pixels is starting to be superseded by most rival cameras but its still large enough for most purposes.
heavier than others in the canon line-up, might be an issue if you're planning on holding it for a day.
cost of spare batteries - but that's not just with this camera.
weight
nothing that i found yet, and i'm not expecting to find any
large and heavy compared to some slrs.
severe chromatic abberation with the kit lens on high contrast and wide angle shots.
live view is fiddly
standard zoom 17-85 is is dark a bit and not wide enough. dystortion seen on the both ends.
lens isn't the best, but it's acceptable as part of the package you get for the money
no polish user's guide
heavy compared to the smaller body cameras like the 450d.
option. very large files (so buy a large cf card). not straightforward to process the raw images, but software is quite good. these are minor complaints!
power switch is quite fiddly, so i hardly use it as the auto power save feature enables me to simply leave the camera turned on all the time and it comes alive as soon as i touch the shutter release button.
poor the quality of the pictures were both at close up and long range the fine detale just was not there.i have tried all of the different settings including auto and manual focus, mounted the camera on a tripod ,taken pictures in raw and jpeg,nothing seems to work. i would not recomend this camera kit to any one stick with the camera on your phone as the eos 40d is only slightly better.
the lens zoom feels slightly too loose, nit-picking but its the only thing i can think of.
there is nothing that troubles me about this camera.
i only bought this camera because canon make a better range of lenses than pentax/samsung. the basic body is not as good as my gx10, but canon does more lenses which have usm.
although the flash is miles better than my previous canon powershot s50 i already feel i would like to upgrade to a flashgun.
no tilt and turn display for live view.
slightly heavy. will take some time studying manual and experimenting to get best out of camera, but pretty good on preset options.
extending barrel design on lens is not the best.
shame it is not a truly weatherproof body.
the only thing that lets the camera down is the fact that you manually have to lift up the flash. however, this is a minor quibble.
no zoom on video.  wide angle could be lower. some noise at high iso settings but not much to worry about. it would be nice to be able to buy the camera and case as a bundle instead of having to purchase separately and pay for extra p and p.
average battery life ,slow recharge of flash between shots,digtal zoom only when shoting video have to use optical before pressing button
a larger capacity card would have  been appreciated by us first time buyers (oap's) but we now understand the storage capacities of the different size cards.
it didnt come with a case
instruction software is difficult to follow for a beginner
flash needs to be raised manually, but that can be postive when you dont want to use the flash and instead rely on the camera to adjust automaticaly for low light conditions.
size, much larger than ixus range, rechargeable battery would be nice
no viewfinder
its abit chunky to carry and feels cheap!
100 photos) works out at around 18p per print, so not too bad either.
high noise content of pictures.  high level of barrel distortion.
having to replace batterys
not good in bad lighting and suffers with camera-shake.
quite large in size
however, being used to another canon (eos 300d), i found a few things disappointing: first of all, where we live we get amazing sunsets, perfectly captured with the eos, but not with the ixus. the sun has a vertical line through it, and the picture just does not have the kind of definition it would provide in 'normal' circumstances. furthermore, the video option is good, but don't zoom in as you will be very disappointed!
no camera case!
manual not as comprehensive as i would have liked. i.e. no instruction on how to find remaining battery power.
no battery status symbl so it suddenly dies on you as there is no warning! v annoying
about 10 out of 300 photos came out slightly out of focus. not sure why, maybe it was my own fault.
uploading pictues to the web portal is a bit of a trial as the size of my pictures needed to be reduced prior to uploading and this isn't pointed out at an early stage.
difficuly to use with unclear instructions
this was a replacement for my canon ixus5.5 which i had for a couple of years only reason i had to replace it was i because i broke the screen! i was slightly disappointed that the 7.7 ixus has cheap black plastic parts where as the 5.5 had metal parts though the reduction in price made up for it.
mechanism this would greatly improve the camera's functionality: a lightweight camera is very difficult to keep absolutely still so it does take a little practice to get a shot that isn't blurred, when you first start using the camera.
no raw files
no battery life indicator.
cant clip photos to get desired picture can only do this on pc
a little too fat - would be better if it fit easier into a pocket. it is still small though - maybe the protective case could be slimmer.
quite difficult to find way about menu - but then i'm not used to everything as yet!  so probably will improve with use.
no bad point
haven't found them yet
not so good on plain colours.
would have liked a hard copy of all the instructions in a booklet.
cant just download individual pictures, all get downloaded
not as many features asothersimilar camers, but generally thisdoes not matter for most users
can't think of anything as yet
difficult to figure out how to use the timer
some of the features required me reading the manual rather than just trying things out.
not enough manual control - but fine as a point and shoot.
why don't they sell it with a case?
not found any yet
picture clarity is not that good even in daylight.
no time to study cd yet
very disappointing regarding ease of taking very high quality sharp images without laborious enhancements on pc
tends over expose some times with almost a white out. this makes it impossible to get a decent result with adjustments on my comuter.
no real bad points
plastic case
uk shop selling us model camera, wanted a 300d but got a digital rebel.
too much plastic, and a poor lens/flash.  you need to buy a much better lens and flash gun to get the most out of this camera.
not many but could do with the same features now found on the 350d
lacks mirror lock up feature. start up time, compared to more recently released cameras, is beginning to appear sluggish.
if one becomes reliant on the automatic focus it quickly, and without seemable cause, becomes out of focus!!!
plastic case
accessories expensive (eg flash guns)
the buil-in flash does not match the sophistication of the camera
a bit heavy and bulky.
have to apply the wasia hack to open features crippled by canon
goes to sleep a bit too quickly
flash stay rattles
no standard flash connector for use with studio lighting sets
some key features dumbed down, e.g. flash exposure compensation, mirror lock up etc. the 350d includes some improvements like adding these features back and has a faster start up time.
this ones mirror mechanism broke in the last month of canons guarantee (but at about 20,000 frames thats a lot of use). fixed well and quickly though. messy procedure required to get continuous frame numbering reestablished where it was.
not found any.
noisey images above iso 400, heavy.
they made the 20d! :(
af can be a little off in poor light.  only 9 af points and in any of the auto modes the camera insists on choosing its own af point which can be a little frustrating!  no raw mode in auto modes
slower shooting rate than 20d (8m vs 6m pixels makes little difference)
very prone to dust on its sensor.
a little heavy. digitals are out of date as soon as you buy them.
cost of batteries
can't think of any!!
start up can be slow(no more than 3 secs.tho)
nothing really that's worth mentioning!
you can't have everything, and because the 10d is solid it is heavy and difficult to lug around even with the minimum of lenses.
handling improved with battery grip, otherwise body a little too small
auto focus
auto focusing does not always work well.
a bit heavy
battery access flap,very flimsey great care has to be taken when opening and closing as the flap could be easily broken.
no party setting like some cameras. video does not last more than one minute
not come across any yet
battery and flash card cover flimsy
no case came with the camera
has to buy a case for it
it doesn't come with a protective carry case, which surprised me.
red eyes
battery/charging system failed after only 2 months - repaired under warranty
connecting point. i feel it could break when lifting cover.
complicated book with overload of more complex detail
will need large memory card if using in video mode on a regular basis.
autofocus occasionally could be sharper in low light settings.  flash not configurable enough for internal shooting.  video recording and playback below that of similar cameras
not as many pixels as some competitors (7 megapixels would be nice)
look and feel they will easily break with normal use
ceased working after 2 weeks
it does not zoom in far enough
when you pay a couple of hundred pounds for a camera i would expect a case with the package
some menu items a bit complex,
zoom a bit keen untill you get used to it
needed too buy a bigger memory card the first time i used it.
the battery cover is not of the same quality as the rest of the camera.
difficult to get good pictures in damp conditions i.e. near waterfalls
not very good red eye control.
wish canon could provide case for the camera.
downloading is taking a bit of practice but probably user error rather than product!
poor flash and memory stick
instruction manual not easy to use.
sometimes it is not easy to taken good photoes of the moving objects.
you sent an empty box and then ran out of stock so i never received the camera
video tricky!
i thought that a case could have been included.
paying slightly too much for brand name.
non found as yet
the camera doesn't come with a case but i sourced one on an internet auction site that fits it snugly (you don't want a small camera and big case!)
you need to keep a spare battery charged at all times.  the one in the camera drains fairly quickly and will switch off the camera at an inconvenient moment.
high price you are paying for the style
not much warning when the battery is running low (but it does last ages)
can't find any yet
shame about bring in a replacement ixus 55 2 weeks after i get the camera.
price
very complex on manual settings. however you don't have to use this feature
can't name any. could be cheaper
battery cover seems a little flimsy.
screen although big is not detailed enough(sony camera's have better), a little expensive.
no continuous battery level display - only just before the battery dies
expensive
flimsy av cover.as a non pc expert the instruction cd's are irritating and awkward to use. a book would be better.
no backward compatibility -i had purchased a canon 4m only last year with a spare battery and memory and this new canon has a fractionally smaller battery and a different memory card. annoying!
i have not found any yet.
lack of expert features (manual settings)
no hand book on how to use it? they may have just missed my box.
lot of problem with all the canon digital camera zoom functionality (lens)
no carrying case.
electronic manual, too much trouble to read.  occasional dubious results - out of focus when on auto focus and a tripod and timer - whhy can this happen?
should be able to crop photos in the camera so no resolution lost. should have a proper manual of instruction and not need to load a cd each time to check operation. i really feel that the little pamphlet provided is totally inadequate and useless when travelling if you need help. i  feel very strongly about the need for a printed manual of instruction   that one can take with one on holiday.
can get blurry pictures with some of the special functions.  not too good at action shots
would have preffered a hard copy of the manual rather than cd rom
in night shot mode it says it has an anti-shake facility to stop blurring, this was not always the case.
shot stability lock not great
bulky in comparison with many in price band but worth it for the better than average lens
only bad point was that it came with a memory card that only holds about 10 pictures, meaning you have to spend extra money on a memory card.
the software/firmware is not the best for downloading individual shots. windows cannot see the camera on its own. i have had to buy a memory reader to do what i want.
normal batteries
not as many features as my older slr, but then much smaller
little bit plasticy
slightly too technical for the novice
no dioptric adjustment on the viewfinder, review screen is not articulated
i am glad the camera has an optical viewfinder even though it is not a very good one
no charger/rechargable batteries with the package
only 16 mb card supplied
. size rather large for a pocket camera.
you need to be seriously into photography before you need all the features.
lots of features, but as i mainly want happy snaps of family etc, i'm unlikely to use most of them!
no rechargable batteries supplied
stabiliser does not always work very well at higher zoom. digital viewer hard to see in bright sunlight.
viewfinder should cover more of field - screen should be brighter (can't see in bright light - can't see it anyway without spectacles!) - battery orientation should be better labelled (for the visually challenged!)
last for a very short while.  fortunately i got onofrmationx from the internet and bought a charger and rechargeable batteries.
cant think of any
it is sold with the smallest card available which restricts the number of photographs you can take until you purchase a larger card.
batteries are expensive and only run out fast, with wile investing in a good battery charger and set of good quality rechargeable aa's
the only bad point i've found is that the menu button on the back does get pushed a lot accidently by the heal of my thumb when in taking picture mode.
the sheer range of features can be somewhat bewildering - but then, you can always trust in the auto setting.
can't think of any at the moment.
images can look a little over processed sometimes. high iso (400+) is very noisy in low light. lcd screen could be better.
viewpoint off centre with lens.
vulnerable to spray/moisture
not obvious when image has failed to focus - the warning light is out of vision when concentrating on the screen. no indication of battery charge until it has pretty well run out: very sudden with virtually no warning. can be surprisingly slow at loading images onto the card, apparently randomly - generally quick but every now and then it takes quite a few seconds.
graphics are too small
taking a picture isn't instant, i.e when you depress the button its a good second before the picture actually takes.
poor lcd screen, large but low resolution and copes badly with direct sunlight.
struggling here. if you're after a camera that will easily fit into your pocket go for an ixus otherwise the a710 shades it.
could do with better wide angle at minimum zoom. would have been too expensive without \xa350 cashback from canon.
cannot tell battery state prior to low warning.
build quality, narrow angle of view.
the accessories don't seem so available after the offer ended.
colour .. i prefer black colour but it is not available
flash could be better, can be a bit all or nothing
not found any yet!
no lcd shade for use in bright sun light makes taking photos difficult as you can't see what you are taking
when it's slightly dark and needs to flash, there is a slight delay - you need to press quite hard to get a picture
small sensor = not brilliant at high iso.  not very wide zoom
from my point of view , and what i use it for mainly, (close up and portrait work ) i find it  excellent and cannot fault it.  it is heavy on batteries but no more so than similar size cameras. if it continues to function like now i will have no complaints.
can't think of any.
veiwing screen in sunlight
on board help would be useful. a previous camera had onboard frames and special effects but with a camera like this want to take good pics and work on them on computer.
it's a bit fiddly to get the sd card out of the battery compartment and that is by far the simplest way to access the photos. if the sd card was in it's own compartment at the side (like my previous camera, the canon powershot g2 for example), that would be simpler.
could do with the ability to capture in raw format.
truth be told i don't think that powershot a650is digital camera has any bad points except that the sd card that comes with the card mb is very limited!
i found the software difficult.
no self timer
that camera don't show battery life, so you never know how long it'll be working.
havnt found any
no particular bad points.
quite bulky.
might be nice with a lithium battery but the 4xaa battery life is good
flash not staying locked in the not required position having to re-ajust when having taking shots in auto mode.
can't think of any.
the manual itself, being on-line, is rather inconvenient as you obviously can't take it with you when you're out with the camera and decide you need to use a feature you've not tried before! there are a lot of features not available on lower spec cameras which you obviously need to learn how to use.  personally i don't like to try to take it all on board at once and will only learn how to use a feature when i actually need to use it.
battery and memory compartment very hard to open.  half press before shooting not always effective.  battery life is lousy - get rechargeables quickly.  don't understand why canon don't make memory card bigger than 512mb.
the battery life is very short and on this point alone i would not recommend this camera to anyone.  it is also quite complicated to get to grips with all the features, although to be fair, it does take good pictures most of the time on auto.
with our previous a70 we received a full and comprehensive user guide. the user guide provided with the a720is is no where near as detailed. unfortunately we have mis-laid the better user guide.
slightly bulky
having to purchase wheels separate, what use is the camera without a card! could at least supply with a 500mb card for the extra bit of cost,
it would be good to have the manual in written form rather than on disc.  i printed the whole thing out and have it in a folder which is much better for finding things than a pdf although not great if you wanted to take it with you.  the door to the battery and card compartment isn't the easiest but that's a small niggle.  why the small memory card included?  it would be better to give nothing than this and perhaps add the saving to that written manuel!!
i prefer to use the viewfinder rather then the screen, but the image it shows is very inaccurate, even at long distance. for example, if you like to put the horizon a third of the way down the frame, you need to line it up with the top of the viewfinder to get the right result. of course, the screen is accurate, but it's strange that canon could have got this so wrong. other reviewers have made the same comment.
red eye correction only works well if the camera automatically recognises a correction is necessary.  results are not so good if the frame needs to be manually set.
optical viewfinder is inaccurate.
higher than average image noise, possibly due to smaller than normal sensor size and high pixel rating.
the carry bag offered in the package is nice, but too small - a spare chip + 2 batteries can only just be accommodated.
can't understand why the manual isn't on the camera - you have the memory, you have the screen - why have to download from a cd?
slightly bulky and time to refresh is too long
nothing bad
no other bad points
i can not think of any at the moment.
would have preferred a smaller camera but advantages outweigh disadvantages
canon zoom browser ex programme seems useful but lacks good instructions/help
i find autofocus to be a bit slow
disapointing view finder.  lcd screen not great in bright light, but does the job. average build quality. battery/memory card compartment feels as if it will fall apart, but is fine so far.
switching between camera and viewing mode for settings is awkward.
the full instruction manual is not printed but is on cd in pdf format.
could be better built, the switches feel a bit feeble, flash charge cycle is a bit long but that's true for all 2xaa powered cameras.
really cant think of any!  i love this little gem of a camera.
low light noise levels
slr.  remote control would be useful.
battery/memory card door also could be more sturdy
managed 4 photos with the sd memory card supplied. surely for a few extra pounds you could provide a sensible size? also think rechargeable batteries should be supplied.
the viewfinder seems really small, but i don't use this because of the size of the lcd screen.  of course, using the lcd screen to take pictures does make the battery life shorter, but that's the case with most up-to-date models of cameras now anyway.
telephoto lens takes a bit of getting used to, also after flash pictures time delay until able to next photo.
had quite a few macro pictures out of focus - i may not have got the hang of it yet.  seems to focus better if using some zoom with the macro ?  rather restrictive 'auto' mode (eg can't force 'fill-in' flash).  flimsy flap to battery compartment.  heavy on batteries (but see good points).  really stupid position of tripod mount point (at very edge of base, so with a mini tripod it always falls over).  no wireless or ir remote control available.  can't see screen in bright light (thank goodness for viewfinder)
i feel that a card should be supplied as standard and more instructions could be in printrd form.
power hungry
not so much a bad point as a disadvantage it does discharge batteries quite quickly.  need to carry replacement charged batteries.
cheap plastic feel ( relative to my old canon s30 shureshot),slow to re-cycle when using flash,no external flash connection/hotshoe.memory card to small from factory.
it is not the most intuitive camera i have used and if you had not used a canon before then you would need to read the manual but as a point and click it works straight out of the box. it is only the more advanced features that might require some study.
not wide angle enough
control of manual settings can be a bit awkward
at this price,nothing bad about it
focussing can be a little hesitant at very close distances, and sometimes gives focus confirmation when the image is obviously not actually in focus.
the time lag between taking one shot and being ready to take another is slow.  i use top quality jpeg sizes which makes for larger files of course - not sure how much it would speed up on a lesser jpeg size.
poor performance in low light conditions, grainy appearance of images in low light, some features are lackiing.
too bulky
plastic and lots of it.  slow flash recharge.
cycle time between using flash is a little bit on the long side .i.e. you cant shoot repeat photos rapidly. must point out though that the camera is using the supplied batteries and this may change with some different batteries
to much plastic does not have a solid feel
couldnt find the timer feature - i will have to read the instructions!
slightly fragile-feeling, especially the battery cover.
the lcd screen is difficult to see in sunlight, so the optical viewfinder is important.
slightly bulky
not found any yet!
plastic tripod mount.
no protective case included.
at the expense of the onger end of the zoom focal length.
doesn't shoot in raw
the time it takes to recharge the flash
focus takes some time to lock on in low light
pics can be a bit noisy at high iso levels
build quality could be better
on the large side for a compact, so finding a suitable smallish bag is tricky.not convinced yet that the dynamic range is as good as my previous compact digital - sky seems over exposed if ground is correctly exposed.
plastic case, but still has a solid feel.
a bit bigger than other similar cameras but the advantage is you can use normal batteries.
if this is your first more technical camera, then the dials and settings can be confusing to begin with. the only advice for this i can give is read the instructions carefully and play around altering different things, this is the best way to get to grips with the different options available.
every time you switch the camera on when i would have hoped to set it as default.the standby function seems to time out quite quickly.maybe i haven't found out the correct settings yet.the written manual is basic to the point of being ridiculous.i haven't used the cd yet but hopefully it will explain the functions.
view finder inaccurate
no raw facility
heavy
. more viewfinder information would be appreciated but as a second camera to a dslr kit i could think of nothing better.
all positive
should include a larger memory card
isnt any
i cannot find any.
no memory card supplyed, no good if you hope to use when arrive.
can't fault it at all.
you need a degree in technology and endless 'stickies' to understand and follow the instruction booklet.
it is sometimes difficult to select the right function quick enough to capture the moment as you would like
feels a little plastically. the catch for the battery and card slot looks a little flimsy, no problems to date.
doesn't come with a memory card of any use
slightly plasticky but not really a problem
since it was catergorised in compact cameras, i would assume it be compact but in fact it is not, it is chunky. i also thought all digital cameras would be rechargable but was completely let down there, it is odd to produce a camera which doesn't recharge especially when the technology is there.
battery life is pretty short.  need top quality ni-mh batteries in good condition.
build quality could be better.
not exactly a bad point but it does take a bit of time to get familiar with all the features and be able to use the camera to its full potential. having said that you can just point and click if that's your thing!
can't see why it can't switch to macro automatically when image is too close on ordinary setting.
very complicated
like all digitals, can be difficult to see screen in bright sunlight. it was useful to have the viewfinder.
does not have remote control via pc.  my old powershop a60 has this and it is a very usefull feature for wild life and scientific photography.
not as good as my g9!!
does not like my 1200ma rechargables shows low battery very quickly, seems to last on alkaline ok , so may be my batts, no time lapse like the ixus, slightly bulky.
video takes up a lot of space (no compression) so limited in length. not sure how good battery life is. wish windows could just see it as a usb memory card or disk so easier to manage transfers.
having had a last years model i am disappointed that batteries are a different size
not very easy to use
no black and white picture program
a bit plasticy.
the automatic features do work well for nighttime shots, although you can easily get round this by adjusting some of the programmable settings.
recharable batteries don't last long particularly if using the flash.
slow flash, aa batteries.
build quality (maybe that's why it's a good value for money)
view finder could be improved upon
not much to mention would be nice having a vario screen, could be slighty more robust.
in this camera we dont have lithium battery thats the only drawback.
can't really think of any to date!
door where batteries are installed is rather flimsy.
lcd screen can easily shatter.  image quality suffers where lines are involved e g railings, yacht shrouds etc.  heavy on batteries.  slow flash re-cycling times.
no bad points used very much durring our holidays in germany good pictures some even look professional and for me thats got to be good
doesnt feel as solid as earlier models.
i haven't used it that much yet to find any bad features.
my only 2 bad points would be that the 16 mb memory card supplied is near useless as it only holds about 4 pictures, not even much good as an emergency back-up so most people will discard it, which is not very eco friendly. also the use of the tripod mount is more difficult as its positioned at the left hand edge and therefore weight distribution is uneven and anything other than a fixed based tripod will have problems.
bit bulky
i was really dissappointed battery life, which definetly lets otherwise fine camera down.
non
i expected more than i got for my money.
low zoom factor, no aperture/speed priority
i find the zoom control a bit fiddly
32mb supplied card is a bit of a joke (2-3 photos), but the cards are so cheap online that it's not a major one so long as you know in advance you'll need one. the camera doesn't obey generic mass storage device, so it won't appear as a drive letter but uses xp's built in attached camera option.. not an issue if you either have a card reader or don't mind using xp's inbuilt option... either way, you don't need to install any drivers on xp anyway, so it's not a huge ordeal - might be worth investigating if you have windows 2000, though
the manual which comes with it doesn't explain all of the functions, you have to go online to do this, which is a bit hard if you don't possess a computer, again a little complex trying to follow the instructions, i think that you are better off to play around with it to find the best way to use it
bit fiddly controls
some features may seem a bit complicated to use initially until you get used to them.
no bad points yet - just haven't been able to test in hot sunny climes yet when we take more pics.
haven't found any yet!
manual only on cd means that you cannot carry it with you unless you print it out yourself which is a big waste of paper if you have an a4 printer as only a small part of the page is occupied.
setup every anti red eye feature but still get them - does not do the multiflash routine to try to prevent redeye
not having a proper handbook for the camera
heavy
poor operating instructions
fits into my wifes handbag too easily
the battery recharge is a bit of a fiddle, my electric tooth brush has a better system!
max print width is 4 inches (standard is 6x4)
zoom control also fiddly
picture quality is not brilliant. more megapixels is a great marketing ploy, but the lenses on these ultra small cameras aren't really up to the job that the rest of the camera is capable of.
nothing comes to mind.
in dark light, the flash only throws for about 7 -  10 feet, some of the automatic settings are hard to remove quickly. no panoramic setting, have removed the underwater setting.
mode switch too easily knocked from photo to video mode.
the flip lid where the card is placed is a bit fragile and feel it could snap off
the software didn't load on a vista machine, so just removed it and used the vista picture software, which is fine.
not as good to take photos of landscape
very much a no-nonsense point-and-shoot, so don't expect slr results.
lack of a mode dial took some getting used to, zoom could be longer.
buttons a bit fiddly
because the user guide cannot be printed out, it's inconvenient to have to switch on my laptop to find out how to do something or check the controls and facilities.
haven't found any.
some settings and features are complicated, non-intuitive and inconsistent (i.e. some features/settings seem to reset to default when the camera is off, others don't).
but you will do this once,in the norm you will use the main buttons which give you red-eye, flash, macro, video, etc. those more basic settings are very usable.
no detailed manual
focus a bit slow in the dark
no full users manual provided
battery cover poor
using aa batteries makes it slightly wider than other cameras but the overall size is still small.
like a bigger lens
i've only have the camera a few weeks and at the moment i can find no bad points, but a suggestion would be ,,,,,,maybe there could be a pack that comes with it as an optional extra to include a camera case and a larger memory card.
its not just a point and click, you have to focus first then click to take picture. so you need to take your time to get a good shot.
no wehere near as good as a panasonic lumix.
.  the disk manual is ok for computer buffs, but it's a bit of a pain to have to insert a disk and run the computer every time you need to know something or other about the camera.
zoom is not big enough
i would have liked a manual explaining all the menu settings. it is good to sit with the camera and a booklet and try out all the things it can do.
it takes a little reading of the manual to understand the basic features, but then easy to use.  not as many modes as some other cameras - but plenty for me!
no nitpicking!
no booklet for technophobes lke me. would have liked a booklet intead of having to look at the computer all the time
nothin
no seperate viewer so not fab outdoors in bright light, instructions very basic and no advice on where to find full user guide
takes a while and a lot of reference to the manual to get used to all the features, but i suppose this is to be expected from an 'all-singing-all dancing' camera. buttons a bit fiddly. also harder to get the memory card out than our last canon camera.
instructions on disc. a handbook would help.
hand book on disc.
the buttons are a little too sensitive to use, you have to 100% concentration when using the camera.
sometimes pictures appear blurry with zoom..but i am probably not that brill at using it yet only been a couple of weeks and the use has not been that excessive to date
instructions not user friendly having to operate camera by trial and error
haven't found any yet!
takes a while to find out all that it does - would be better with paper manual instead of on a disc
some of the menu and settings are hard to find at first, but once you find them, you'll know where to look next time.
the screen and body of camera are constantly covered in smeary finger marks - dont forget to get a lint free cloth!!
graphics on back quite small to read.
supplied sd card totally inadequate, they might as well not bother including it.
zoom could be better.
no view finder - could be a probolem if you take alot of photos in bright sunshine as lcd screen only
little of note!
for this price it should at least come with a case
no viewfinder
a pity there isn't printed information on how to use it so that one doesn't have to go to the computer screen each time one wants to learn a further point.
slightly fiddly menu system and videos clips are very large in size. i use a 16gb media card and took around twenty-five 3 min video clips and it used up most of the storage space! canon need to use a more efficient video codec.
the metal front of the camera easily rubs and scratches, but then it is designed to take a few hard knocks.
not cracked effective red eye yet.
needs a more detailed booklet for those without computers.
the lens like all the others at of this type gives a wide equivalent of 35mm which in confined spaces is quite often not wide enough.
- would be nice to have a curve to grip
a little heavy.
would prefer printed manual as pc required to see full instructions for more detailed use of camera.
a little heavier than my old ixus ,still perfect except the dock broke.
had a job tracking down a retailer that had it.
no viewfinder
memory card way too small
not the easiest camera to use but isnt really complicated
no case!
mode dial is a bit fiddly.
no case!!!
easy to scatch the screen.
.
seems a bit complicated to me but 13 year old finds it simple
not very robust- got dent on front in first few days- not sure how?
cameral is heavy when loaded with battery
relatively heavy
very confusing controls, not at all easy to use.
software a little more difficult to use than the olympus but not too bad after a little practice.
only the basic manual came with the camera - had to download 2nd user guide for more complicated features.
understanding how to operate all the various features [ you have to view the instructions on the disc on the computer]. i would have preferred an instruction booklet which i think would have been more convenient to refer back to.
can't take pictures in black and white (can only change after you've taken them), in-camera red eye reduction software doesn't really work and the panoramic photo stitching thing is hard to get right.
only one i can think of at the time, is the manual could be improved, mind you half the fun is findindg out what the camera can do, i think you will be very very suprised.
no case supplied
small memory card provided - even as back-up. excellent battery but expensive to buy back-up. soft felt sock could be provided to protect camera, while in pocket, from minor scratches
took a while for the zoom to focus
the apple-esque roller wheel isn't very easy to use.
slightly larger than average camera
some people might find this a bit heavier than most other cameras in it's class. there are no manual settings to speak of which might hamper in tricky situations. some of the buttons can be a bit fiddly and some of the options, like deleting photos, aren't very intuitive.
only that it isn't as fast as my ixus 75 (which i lost).  i guess that's down to the difference in megapixals.  still pretty darn quick though!!
i don't like the  instruction manual on a disc but would prefer a hard copy so that it is easier to read and practice features on the camera, where i choose, rather than having to be at a computer..
the flash sometimes needs to be turned off as the photos become overexposed!
not found any yet.
no detailed user manual, the build material keeps marks and digit prints so it looks a bit dirty after an intensive use.
not the smallest of cameras(though not large) - just not the best pick if you want something particularly light and compact.
button is very sensitive and something annoys.
the rotary selection wheel is erratic and not easy to control to rapildy select new scene modes. too much finger pressure and the wrong scene is selected - but maybe i have fingers like suasages at my age.
low capacity memory card bundled, no case
no camera case provided
multi control dial, which is not very user friendly.
yet to find any.
not as many features as the more bulky digital cameras, but thats to be expected.
could feel a little more robust in build.
low zoom range, not hd resolution video.
had to buy bigger memory card
memory card supplied with it is too small. would rather have paid extra to have a useful size memory than have to go out to buy it seperately
zoom may be a bit too short?
owners (printed) instruction manual does not contain enough information.  detailed information has to be loaded and printed out from cd. over 236 pages. on/off switch a bit fiddly.
lower end of zoom could have been a bit wider
the on/off button is not positioned well, making switching the camera on/off quite tasking.
the outer silve case scratches very easily - mine is already marked, and it has only been in a ladies handbag iwth a soft lininig. the wrist strap looks cheap and does not match the quality of the camera. the memory card supplied is a waste of time.
find the menus harder to navigate than my previous ixus
the sim card supplied is to small
yet to find any!
i preferred my old canon ixus i, which produced good pictures and was easy to hold and operate.
fiddly on/off switch.
it was so good that my daughter fell in love with mine, so i ended up buying another one for me which doubled the cost!
the only drawback is that you can't charge the battery while it's in the camera, you have to put it into a charger.  most of the time this isn't a problem, but it adds to the luggage on a trip.
mode dial very strange to get used to - no feedback when rotating
the button to switch the camera on and off is slightly small, but i see this as a good point as it will not accidently turn itself on in my pocket or handbag and drain the battery.
does not have the wide angle lense. scratches easily.
on / off button a bit fiddley if you have big fingers
poor image stabilizer, no manual operation
on/off switch
quality of battery cover flap a little flimsy letting down an other wise well built camera
the on/ off  button is so small and fiddly it sometimes takes several minutes to turn it on!! a shame because i've missed shots because of it
have yet to master battery life and was expecting a warning when it needs a recharge.
haven't discovered any yet.
hav'nt found any so far
i am still trying to come to terms with all the settings. your company was certainly the best value by far of all the ones i looked at on the net, but the camera was still a little pricey for a poor pensioner, but i deserved a treat. i didn't tell the wife how much it cost !
manual focusing took time to get used to, and understand the right combination of buttons to press. it does tend to feel a bit plastic, but i think that is likely with any camera in this price range.
if its a firts venture into slr photography (as it was for) can be difficult to get to grips with all the features.  would recommened a purchase of a dummy guide to go along with the camera that helps you to understand thefeatures of the camera.
on a couple of occasions it auto mode has been a bit slow to take the pic, maybe struggling to focus because of multiple subjects. probably operator error and still only a minor issue when set against all the benefits. we are loving the pictures we can now get.
there are lots of new functions to learn and some not in the obvious places but i will learn them with more use
it's not got video, but then i didn't want video on my dslr so i'm not bothered. might put some people off though?!
in full auto mode the pop-up flash pops up every time !
not found any so far
can't think of any, got this for my girlfriend for christmas and she loves it.
kit lens is fine to start off with, but you'll be wanting a larger lense almost immediately!!
having never used a slr camera before i have had to attend a course to learn how to get the best use not just on full automatic mode.
not impressed with the supplied lens cap which could easily become lost as it it cannot be attached to camera, other than that i have found no bad points.
feels a bit plasticy. nothing else.
cant really think of much yet but to point out there is no video feature. however, i have a video camera for that and its not why i bought the camera.
not found any so far!
a case and perhaps some filters would have been nice, but for and entry-level camera there's really nothing wrong with it.
maybe a little heavy but you have to expect that, it isn't a pocket camera.
the click of the camera is rather loud. not so good for those interested in sneaking up on wildlife to take candid shots. though i'm sure most other cameras have a resounding click also. no other bad points to report as yet.
it's obviously more bulky than a point and shoot camera but if you want more control and want a camera to allow you to create more flair in your photography then that's the sacrifice you make.
would like larger screen.
cannot shoot raw files on the cheat modes. other than that, very little, i love it!
it could do with spot focus.
bearing in mind the low price, it is inevitable that the camera and lens have that 'plastic' feel of modern cameras.
? i couldn't find any real problems at all with this camera!
lens cover not attached can be misplaced
could have included a basic bag of some sort for the camera
bulky as with all slrs
2. the camera body gives a plastic like touch. i dont know what this material is but certainly dosent give a nice feeling.
found the battery hatch very easy to open by accident but extremely minor point
raw files only usable on 10.1m setting which is too large for my computer to process quickly! would prefer a 6m option - similar to 300d
not very good lense for zoom shots - but then you can always buy add ons
not found any yet.
carry bag that came with offer is a little bit too big whilst i dont have ay other lenses
no doubt if you spect more you would get a better camera but for me it's an excellent entry level product to the world of digital photography.
would have liked the standard 18 - 55 lens to have image stabilisation.
not found any as yet
feels rather cheap and plasticky compared to previous film slrs i have owned (this is my first dslr camera). doesn't come with a memory card.
cost of additional lenses. generally all the canon extras are pricey, good news is that there are many pattern parts to purchase.
making full use of all thecapabilities will take some time with the manual.
no instructions on how to use some of the supplied software.
can feel unbalanced to hold
is a professional camera so takes some getting used to if you are a beginner like me.
haven't found any yet.
the lens cap is not secure enough, it fell off numerous times until i eventually lost it and had to buy a new one
cant always change the apeture less than 5.6
- some problems with auto focus at times
battery life
grip feels very cheap. no memory card included.
? i can do that anyway.
aint found any yet
lens cap tends to fall off.
you can't view the shot on the screen as you take it, you must use the view finder. the screen is quite small.
no video recording mode, but then still a lot of features for taking stills and overall great value for money considering the product you're getting.
the lens that comes with the camera is the most basic one, there is one with built in image stabilisation, which may be worth keeping an eye out for.
have not found any yet
some controls a little fiddly
so far i haven't found any bad points.
lense is very basic.
cant seem to get hold if it now!
flash is a bit unreliable
the lens range is good close up, but not for long shots.
could do with different effects
1. automatic focus takes too long  2. automatic flash comes on too often. there is plenty of light but it normally still comes on
in the package was included a uv filter, the package would be better if it had a small starter tripod instead.
the non-is lens wouldn't have been anywhere near as good.
i use it for astrophotography, so one thing it could use is a setting for night vision on the lcd - its a bit too bright even on the lowest brightness setting.
printing, the cd that came with the camera is not easy to follow. the prints are good but as yet i have been unable to size my prints and they all come out at a4 size.
it isn't very practical for teenagers!
non discovered so far
pity there is no video function and i wish there were more point of focus targets in the black areas in the viewfinder.
it will make you want to buy another
no bad points.
initially a little confusing, no live display on screen, macro shots focus quite far away
the zoom is poor would have liked a longer zoom for the cost.
a little bit heavy, and doesn't come with a case.
cannot take short video bursts
havent found any bad points
rather chunky plastic camera.
no bad points
no particular bad points
haven't found any as of yet
nothing
a little platicky in feel, but certainly not a show shopper, to be expected for an entry level camera.
no spot metering
manual is a little overpowering with not enough easy to understand instructions being easily accessible.
no bad points
an image stabilising lense would be nice but i don't think the extra money for a 450d is. actually worth it for what you get.
not found any yet.
i'm too used to opening the box, connecting the gizmo up - and using it. i had to dash out and buy a memory card and a lens hood and a bag - yes! i know it was clear what i was getting so it's my fault for not reading the small print - but wouldn't it be nice not to have to worry about the essential accessories?
live view system was not as easy to use as i would have liked.
i haven't found any yet.
no bad points
havent found any
it's a bit big compared to some other digital cameras around at the moment.
would benefit from a viewfinder, particularly in bright conditions when the screen can be difficult to see.
haven't found any yet.
wife wanted a view finder but it doesn't seem as any of the cheaper camera's have them anymore.
a bit too large.
a bit big, uses battery power very quickly
the card supplied has very little storage.
havent had it long enough yet but so far no bad points
feels tinny
flimsy build. lens jams with low batteries.
plastic feels a little cheap, screen display poor visuals
zoom lens keeps jamming open and the camera goes bonkers.
easily beats cameras at twice the price
no protective case
would have liked bigger zoom, but that's really nit-picking!
black camera looks plasticy, try the silver option in future
should come ith a case
goes through batteries quite quickly if you taking pictures in an area with poor lighting.
cannon only allowing the features they offer if you sign up to share all information. not too sure about the lens drive.
the picture quality not brilliant but it does the job. a good handy snapper!
button for looking at previous photos is awkward to use.
not necesarily
really bad picture quality
very bulky, budget camera
battery life.  it eats up aa batteries within minutes so now use rechargeable.  wish it had a proper rechargeable battery inside it to give longer life.
no carrying case which is a shame.
not yet used.
had to return camera as problem with lens
canon does not say which type of sd card is best for the camera.  there are so many different levels of these memory cards in terms of writing speed, that i am at a loss for which is best for video writing to the card.  additionally, i like to carry my camera manual in my camera bag for on the road...and all canon gives is a pdf file which is impractical for printing and carrying in the camera bag.
let's you shoot before autofocus is complete, so a few blurry pics on nights out
possible build quality. my old ixus was metal, no issues, my last canon purchase, camera was dropped and one of the plastic catches in the battery compartment broke off. that said... if you throw a camera on the floor... and it still takes pictures... what more can you ask? and canon aftercare is good so a repair is feasible.
uses aa batteriesand there fore takes 5to 7 seconds to recover after using flash.the
the grip around the picture button could be improved, made more tactile and non-slip.
it is great to have a viewfinder, but what you view is then not exactly what is then taken (so get a shock when preview the image as you think i do not remember having that in the frame!).
have n't found any yet
viewfinder is low resolution and actual pictures look better than the image displayed on the camera. flimsy cover for batteries and memory card.
i can think of is if you take it out of your pocket , the shooting mode dial accidentaly moves. the face detection thingy i need to look at more closely as it only appears to capture 1 face rather than multiple - dunno yet still learning.
no manual setting
no case supplied
i have not yet found any bad points with this camera.
it's heavy on batteries - it only uses 2 x aa 1.5 v batteries, and they don't seem to last very long.
the proper viewfinder is not very good. eats batteries?
no manual settings
no case supplied
battery power goes quite quickly
small sd card
not enough explanation in the booklet.  casing separates too easily.
flash may be underpowered.
the usual plastic body (but to be expected at the price). the lack of a user manual is usual these days and downloading and printin g out the pdf file is a pain in the ****
lack of operational instructions
some of the features are not that easy to use; a little overcomplicated
could do with a strong case
not as intuitive as i would prefer, though it was difficult to try and think of any points that could be considered as bad
menus still not very clear and the written manual is too vague.
wish the small handle attached to the camera had a button you can push down to your wrist so that you feel that you are holding it more securly, like the old style. but nothing wrong with the camera at all.
not found any bad points at this time
instruction manual a bit brief and you are expected to download the remainder from the software
somewhat flimsy door for connection to computer.
manual is on disc only, a short paper copy of usage would be preferred - can't carry a disc with you on holiday etc.
didnt come with full small manual so had to print off in a4 135 pages - not ideal !
havent found any yet
i am 78 years old and not very good at computors and i think it is very mean of canon not to supply a manual in paper form.i have inserted the disc but cannot find the photos i have tranferred to my computor  which i did easily following the book which came with the camera.panasonic supplied an excellent comprehesive book manual and i think i may have to use that camera,which still functions, to tranfer and find, print etc, from the computor.
was able to format the memory card accidentally. no safeguard as to whether or not format was required as on most cameras.
so far i,ve not come across any!
time delay between pressing 'shutter release' and photograph being taken.
plug-and-play. any suggestions?
the only bad point is the user guide which gives only very basic information.
i haven't found any
there are limited settings for different environment, possibly because most settings are automatically adjusted when taking photos. the hinge of battery cover seems easily damaged so need to be careful not to drop it.
covering material (plastic) could be better quality, or metal
doesn't stabilise the image too well with low lit conditions  and in long zoom.  but otherwise.. great!
nothing bad to say, it is good value for money
on a cheaper camera i had before i was able to change some setting on the camera which changed the pixel of a picture using format and i tried to do this but not full understanding (until an experence photo taker friend explaind)  what i was about to do (due to jargon) cleared my entire memory card of all its pictures from xmas to start of march o my little boys.  if the warning message would have been more cleare ie are you sure you want to delete the photo stored i would not have continued but instead to just stated do you want to save these changes(nothing about deleting photos) of which i did answer yes as i though  was just change the quality of my prints as this is what it would have don before - this in turn has made me very apprehensive about using thiscamera for important photos so please be aware of the formatting part as well as evey thing else ( i dare not touch anything now)
haven't found any yet.
the only minor bad point is that no memory card comes with it so to use it straight away you have to be prepared and already have one
a bit difficult to hold because it is so small but i will get used to that the more i use it.
cannot take photos quick enough. you have to wait after each photo until you can take the next.
i honestly can't think of any but then i haven't yet tried all the features.
some of the buttons are a bit fiddly if you are getting on a bit!
not found any ,
but obviouly we will have to understand, its far better for the money paid for it.
noise is slightly distracting but the positives outweigh the only negative
not as well built as my older version of this model. dont like the plastic button to switch from video to camera
a little bit more than similar camera's - but well worth it i think
action shots take a bit of practice as the shutter speed is not instance, but when you get the timing right the photos are good.
a bit pricey, but you do get what ypou pay for.
red eye and focus in light
image quality has been varied but i am still getting used to it so it could be down to me
no aperture or speed priority manual settings
cover on av connection point flimsy. no hand book ( on line ). no memory card included. wrist strap has no tightener.
cover for the usb lead is fragile and looks like it will break before long
loses sharpness at max zoom
very bad indoor photos and outdoor photos are fine, compared to sony, this cant stand a chance!
the cost of the appropriate cover
the colour when using 'auto' setting is a little washed out but because there are so many manual options this can be quickly overcome.
so far after little initial use,i have found no bad points at all.
organisation of downloaded pictures rather restricted.
having to remove the battery to recharge it
only down side is that the zoom should be a little better but don't be put off by that.
if you run out of battery you have to re charge or buy another
would have liked a nicer, more substantial carrying case
delete button is too close to scroll when reviewing photos on the camera!
haven't found any yet.
cheap and nasty build quality
no case.
mode or manual override for aperture / speed selection.
not really a bad point, more probably about me not understanding how to make the flash stay off permantly rather than having to turn it off every time i turn camera on.
instructions could be a bit more detailed.
it's not instinctive how to put it on the different manual settings.
shorter zoom range than some - but would then be much more expensive
onboard charger may have been better to avoid having to take external charger.
it would be helpful if a case was provided with the purchase package as most people will slip this camera in a bag or large pocket and this would avoid unnecessary scratching or seeking the purchase of a suitable cover.
flimsy battery opening.
doesn't have any - i personaly don't like the button for changing from auto to manual and video, but that is a matter of a personal taste
limited, but adequate, zoom range
takes a little while to focus on point and shoot, which i am not used to, but that's what gets good results i suppose.  no instruction manual in package.... you have to look on computer.  very bad.
some of the colours, particularly flesh tones, over saturate
zoom lens motor makes a noise which suggests it will stop working long before the camera does.
screen a bit fuzzy but actual picture great quality
flash a bit weak
i am annoyed that it does not allow you to crop and save a cropped photo. this was not obivious from the specification and i just assumed it would have that facility as we have had cheaper cameras in the past that have had that facility. i thought it was standard these days. unfortunately by the time i realised i had thrown the box away so can not exchange it for a camera with the crop and save facility. i would love to be able to upgrade if i could??????
can't think of any really, perhaps attaching the usb cable is a bit fiddly but apart from that.
not many options of taking pictures, there is no option of taking panorama, etc.
performance.
a bit fiddly.
can't think of any!
quite complicated to work out all the settings at first so you have to sit down and work out what everything does.
most of the manual has to be downloaded and printed off which is tiresome, some instructions are not clear to beginners.
manually overiding auto settings is fiddly e.g. to maually out flash on
a bit hit and miss in low light, socket cover a little flimsy.
zoom could be longer
print manual lacks in depth features, scene mode menu not as quick to access as would like (ie on powershot models). no in camera battery charging facility in basic pack.
not found any as yet.
can't think of any.
the price dropped on your web site the day i received it!!
lack of manual features, small view screen
takes a long time between images when using flash and i find the battery runs down too quickly particuarly when driving my long lens. could be a little more intuative - perhaps take some advice from nokia!
a single battery and a single memory card (not included with camera) will probably not suffice.
still to find anything wrong with it.
no chip when purchasing camera, could get caught out if you don't check first.
feels a bit small in your hands, i will be buying the camera grip...
it's got a 'creek' on the handhold grip!!
silver scratches to leave black marks
only that i can't find out how to turn off the flash in the menu programme but only on the mode dial.
software more complicated than the camera!
i cannot think of any!
huge learning curve required, buy and experiment some time before really needed!!
all to easy to accidently press the self timer button by mistake without realizing till you press the shutter,could be better positioned.
build quality good but could be better, chips easy.
cannot take pictures using the lcd screen at the back, you can only review pictures once taken.
not easy to turn the flash off
lens isn't brilliant. lack of compatibility with other canon lenses is a bit annoying.
18-55mm lens in the kit is cheap feeling
the lcd is only used to review shots afterwards, not used as a viewfinder. whilst it is different to cheaper digi-cams, it doesn't take much getting used to and i actually think its better to compose shots through the viewfinder.
the standard lens which comes with the camera.
i only wish it had a lens cap that was attached!!
watch out for which cf card you buy some don't work with the camara
no bad points, but first time users should definately research before buying to make sure it is what they need and want. i found that light is needed even if you are using the flash, and many first time users should take this into account.
only one grouse - you have to view through viewfinder without a screen option
small point position of dof button
if your're used to a digital camera which lets you change photos before transfer to the computer, you can't do it with this one (not a big deal really)
i havent found any bad points with this camera
like most dslr's a bit trigger happy on autofocus until you get used to the correct pressure (assuming that your joints allow full control)
still trying to find some.
not all of the functions are immediately obvious or accessible
could have benefited from protective filter lens to start. still quite bulky for general photography
no image stabiliser.
havent found any
would like to be able to change all settings to black and white.
should come with a case as standard
nothing at all
the manual is massive and it's going to take a long time to get to grips with it all.  also the flash isn't very strong and i will defo need to buy a mounted flash for it.
can't see preview of picture
images, when taken on automatic tend to be darker than when taken with a canon powershot and a 30d
standard lens doesn't show camera body in its best light
not the most comfortable camera to hold. the firmware and bundled software are a bit clunky but usable. canon's approach to fill-in flash is counter-intuitive, to say the least.
the 18-200 lens is not at its best when photographing near objects.
canon software would not load on my net book (screen resolution not high enough)
it's years since i've had a slr, so the camera/lens combination seems a little heavy and unbalanced towards the lens - but that might just be my lack of experience with this kind of camera.
above 800 asa the quality becomes very low
would have been nice to have a custom made bag come with the outfit.
very slow and non-automatic focus in film mode.
haven't found any yet although i think a spare battery might be required
the body is made of plastic and therefore less durable than other camera
tip - try to acquire your sd card from a rainforest in south america  if you can ;) and make sure that it is rated high enough for hd video. mine is a class 10 and it works wonderfully.
i use it for filming also but the 500d doesn't have a mic input and full hd only films at 20fps which is really good but just isn't quite enough for fast moving subjects.
cannon accessories are prohibitively expensive. kit lenses not the greatest quality but do the job. on camera flash is a bit harsh (as are all on camera flashes)  but given time and the money they can be all be addressed.
shame there is no sun shade as standard with the standard kit lens.  a package including a canon flashgun would also have been a welcome addition from jessops to help get the best from this camera.
the only thing i would say would be to do with the viewfinder. i didn't realise that for most options you have to look through the viewfinder, rather than at the screen. this is very minor and doesn't really matter too much, but i did fiddle with the camera for ages, worrying i was doing something wrong, before i realised! ;)
the camera is still very much a new toy for me and i don't have enough experience to really pick it apart and find faults. it is my first d-slr and it has already opened up a whole new world of photography to me, with my prior experience being based around fairly basic point-and-shoot digital cameras.
the leses are not of high quality!
as a long retired ex-professional i find that the lenses are quite 'soft.' efs 18-55 and ef 75-300 so the uploaded image has no crisp lines and edges. it will work a treat for potraiture and people shots but for sport and wildlife will lack crispness.  offering a deal with fast fixed focal length lenses like a f1.8 50mm and a fast 85mm would bridge a gap between this camera and the professional models. canon did it very well, pre digital, with the a1 which saw lots of professionals using it with the 7fps motor drive.
no bad points found in the fist week of use
this isn't really a bad point, however i do recommend getting one of the more specialised pocket guides book at the outset of purchase so that you get the most out of your camera straight away.  as an entry level dslr the manual included expects certain knowledge that you may yet need to comprehend.
if wearing it around your neck for long periods of time it can become quite heavy but i'm sure that's the same for any slr as this one doesn't feel heavy compared to some.
one small niggle, why can't the lens cap have a cord on so that it can be left attached to the camera rather than having to stuff it in the nearest pocket, possibly containing dust or other matter which may not be lens friendly.
cannot think of any, but then i am not an expert !!!
not many creative auto functions but i will need it mainly for manual purposes so does the trick perfectly!
not yet found
shoulder stap would be much better if was a clip on type instead of being threaded through the body and the lens cap would benifit from having a cord attached from the body to the cap.
the tamron lens does not have an image stableizer built in nor does the camera so if i bought this again i would pay the extra and get the canon 250mm zoom.
you really need a screen protector but thats nothing wrong with the camera.
the 3.4 frames per second continuous shoot is no better than the 350d, but for anyone not wanting to take fast action sports shots this shouldn't pose too much of a problem. i would have much preferred around 6 frames per second (like the eos40d for example).
as yet i haven't found any
no found any
although the lenses were interchangeable with my 500d, i was disappointed that the battery pack has been changed
after nearly 2 months of use, i have not had any issues yet and do not think i will have.
no memory card so had to wait 3 days to use it x
no image stabiliser
live view not active during auto mode
not found any yet.
no bad points
only 1. i would like to see a panorama function built-in. software is provided to do this manually on a pc but i've found it tricky to keep the shots in synch with white balance etc
both lenses provided although absolutely fine are lacking a bit in quality, it would have been great to get a good quality 70-200mm lens instead of the 75-300.
add on lens prices.
lenses, not the best in terms of quality. would suggest to just buy the body and then purchase a super telephoto and decent prime lens instead - wish i had.
i can't find any yet!
so far no. i hope the camera and lens will keep the brand flag high up for a long time.
little bit expensive.
non so far
haven't found any so far.
still learning  ---------------- no problems so far
the telephoto lens is not highly rated
doesn't feel as solid as my 450 also neither lens has image stabilisation.
nothing at the moment
i cannot say so far i have found anything that stands out.
-
let you know when i find them
not as weather proofed as 7d, but you wouldn't expect it to be at this price.
appearance.
it is a pity that a basic memory card is not included in the kit.
image istabilzer is missing
both lenses are without is. they can produce a decent picture if using a tripod or you have very steady hands.
the lenses are a bit cheep, and suffer fron the lack of is, and the ends twist with focus so using filters is a pain.
lenses don't have an attachment cable to body. lost one lens cap already in a field
nothing
nothing at all.
supplied with a lense 18-55mm and telephoto lense 75-300mm leaving a gap between 55 and 75mm it may have been better to supply a 55-200mm or 18-80mm instead?? other than that no other faults
battery life isn't the best, recommend getting a second battery.
the lenses are not the best canon lenses although they are fine for domestic use.  the usm lenses would have been better.
i haven't found any yet.
instruction manual too small - ok if you have a1 vision!
cover over the side sockets keeps popping open
movie capture isn't great (but why would you want to?)
could do with a lens hood on the zoom lens.
very minor point, it would be nice if the lens had a string attaching it to the cover.
instructions make it sound harder than it really is.
haven't found one yet!
bit misleading offer 50m lense no image stabilizer
i don't at the moment i'm still testing it. will let you
cant fault it i have not found any yet!
bulkier than point and clicks
picture setting dial easy to knock off setting
slightly on the small side, but if used with a battery grip ok.
as a complete novice, i could do with more basic instructions for the manual focus techniques.
i have yet to find any... very very happy with my purchases and service i have received
tamron lens in this kit has no image stabiliser, which does make a difference to some of your freehand shots.  build quality is a bit plastic like considering how much it costs.  i've switched from olympus because the accessories are too expensive but prefer the olympus settings and ease of use! the software is also questionable for editing!
no memory card included - remember to buy one!
i guess the only criticism i can make is that the lenses don't quite have the silky smoothness of movement of nikon
small
software not compatable with all computers
less features as compare to nikon 5100
complex instruction book needs time to read.
after 1 month from buying you have relased new and better nikon 3200 at the same price.
the standard lense is not much use.
fps speed could be faster
live view mode you would think is really handy but basically renders the automatic focus useless, especially when using it to shoot video.  you have to go manual focus otherwise the camera pretty much goes through the complete focal range of the lens before going sharp.  but on that note if you have gone for an slr why would you want to use it like that anyway in my opinion.
no image stabilisation but not a problem if you haven't got a shakey hand!
no canon cashback available on this particular item???
dissapointing image quality, hardly any better than my panasonic tz20. could not open pictures in high quality on my computer
that it does well.
heavy and a bit bulky. not sure the shutter button is quite in the right place - this is a personal preference.
not found any,not expecting to.
not being able to crop photos until you print them
no memory card - would be useful just to get going.
not discovered any yet
static view screen
have found capturing fast moving objects tricky e.g. airplanes but this is probably due to user inexperience.
very heavy
not found any yet.
can't find any yet
sometimes difficult to focus in video mode ( probably me not doing it correctly)
feels a bit plasticy
you'd have to be a professional to be able to find any weak points.

didnt come with a memory card or case so couldn't use it until i bought a memory card from amazon.
not much bad things to it.
live view will only work in some settings
non so far
cant think of any
perhaps a memory card to start.
non yet found
software supplied is a little disapointing.
the only bad thing...it could use a little more grip. apart from that its perfect.
body is slightly small in your hand
cannot find no bad points

i just wish that the manufactures would not put out so many pieces of equipment so often.  with my purchase i find i very hard to find faults and it not be constructive to nit pick.
the kit lens is horrible, save your money for a proper lens or buy second hand.
not included .this would be the first camera kit i have purchased that did not have a proper brand hood.
can feel heavy after long session.
you'll be disappointed if you use a non-l zoom, you need prime lenses. depth of field often incredibly shallow and automatic settings don't bring great results, you'll need to learn to use manual settings to get the most out of it so it will take time - you won't get perfect shots right out of the box. you'll be referring to the manual a lot.
price
really need a new lens to get the best out of this camera
it is not advisable to use when raining
i find that when wearing the 50d around my neck that sometimes the mode selector changes, and sometimes even the on/off button too!
not the easiest system to learn for the keen amateur.
heavy
final words ... steer clear of currys!
haven't found anything so far!
no manual. the starter guide directs you to a website to download the manual but when you go to it it says there is no manual available.
maybe feels a little plasticy and light.
battery quickly exhaustefd.
had to spend another 45 pounds for memory card it's ridiculous it doesn't come with camera as it always did before

no manual. the starter guide directs you to a website to download the manual but when you go to it it says there is no manual available.
battery can easily be fitted wrong way round.
these shocking failings (of which no mention is made in specs) make this camera overpriced and hugely disappointing. buy a different brand.
i would not have bought the camera if i had known that it uses a different operating system to my two other canon cameras (one an ixus, one a eos). i feel like i have wasted my money.
about 5 second lag between able to take another picture
could come with a case and sd card that would make it faultless.
slightly bulkier than some of the competition but this is a very minor point
early days but no adverse comment so far.
very noisy at iso400 and even more so at iso800 (although handy to have the options). lcd display and viewfinder lcd display not very high resolution, making manual focusing very difficult (though auto focus is excellent anyway). best image quality at around f4.5, smaller aperture gives little noticeable improvement in depth of field and loses some sharpness. no indication of battery level until just about to go flat!  manual focusing a bit fiddly so rarely used. video mode doesnt support pal 25 or 50fps, only 30fps so will need some conversion for best quality. no widescreen on video, although available for photos.
3. in auto/program mode images are little overexposed in bright sunlight. can be reduced in other manual modes.
screen could be brighter
the lens cover is worse than useless, falls off too easily
starts getting heavy after a few hours, but that's the price you pay for a pro-body!
no video recording.
the back screen is easily damaged and needs to have some form of protection. whilst i'm very careful with the camera, i work in the field and have found that after the first assignment the back screen was damaged.
the problem with having a full digital sensor \x96 is you get the chromatic aberation problems \x96 shooting raw helps as you can remove this later
tends to overexpose on evaluative metering though this can be compensated for.
no built-in fill-flash. i find this a major issue - the argument about prism size being the reason is just lame.  other major gripe is that no matter how carefully you handle this body, the sensor always has dirty spots, which are particularly annoying as i take most of my shot with a large f-stop.
i have no use for the direct print button, seems like a waste of space.  the metering seems very very sensitive, it takes some getting used to.  the red tones are a bit extreme, i have learned to compensate for that.
you have to be an experienced user to get the best from it.ie exposure compensation
no lcd screen protection
no eye focus control as eos 3.
not aware of any.

but hey! with canon you get what you pay for which is quality.
must look thru view finder to take pictures
no built in anti shake
did not come with a bag and the lenses are expensive to buy.
can't think of any.
it took to long to come
a bit on the heavy side. and perhaps i might have expected a bit more on the iso rangeon the up side.
lots of information, and takes time to learn all features, but it is all you need to have a toy  you can enjoy for long
had to resolve my missing booklet by contacting canon direct once they confirmed it should have been supplied.
medium weight
camera is very heavy and this is nothing to worry about but i couldnt think of any bad points yet.
lack of a metal body makes it feel slightly more fragile and other camera's in the range.
it uses a rechargeable battery pack rather than disposable aa batteries. this means that if you are out for an extended period you might be wise to get a spare battery pack.
image is not as good as expected.
does not look or feel as sturdy as i'd like.
an image card was not included in the price. as with toys now including batteries, i think all cameras should come with an image card (even if it is a small one that dies not store many photos).
video background sound quality a little dodgy but you can't  have everything
i haven't found any yet
if you buy one for yourself, your children will steal it. you'll end up buying two.
display screen is not bright enough on sunny days.
build quality could be better. but still good value.
batteries, but normal at this standard not to have rechargeable battery. also would like viewfinder as an additional feature.
aa battery is reallty annoying!
so far i have not discovered any bad points !
batteries might cause unconvieniece. at first i used common aa batteries but they didn\xb4t last at all. when i started to use rechargeable batteries i was able to use may camera properly.
not very good batery life, it would be a 10 out of 10 if it lasted longer
nothing of note so far
heavy
poor battery life
en color negro se quedan todas las huellas.

fingers!?
rear buttons quite small and a bit fiddly, but it is a small camera, so to be expected really.
as with all compact cameras, there is that slight lag between shots that you don't get with slrs.
can't think of any.
lost the first one. not brilliant in poor light conditions
have not found any in the first two weeks.
no viewfinder means holding it away from your body - a less stable shooting position
the focus in movie mode is hard to use
feels very plasticy rather than solid. manual not the easiest to understand as it's obviously used for slightly different models too.
having trouble registering the lens with tamron for guarantee.
neck strap short!
battery life not great
body feels more plasticky than previous models, although this does make it very light. battery doesnt seem to last so long, but then i have had it turned on for very long periods.
poor plastic casing for a canon in the ixus range
no case or memory card provided.
outer casing appears cheap to the touch.
you cannot autofocus whilst filming video, but this would only be an issue for those wishing to film whilst not in direct control of the camera.
as a dslr beginner, it took a little while to get my head around the various functions of the 600d, but i'm getting there!
no viewfinder so taking shots in sunny conditions is awkward
gps tracking via your mobile phone feature is too much bother
very heavy, so after a 6 hour shoot it does start to show, also make sure you have fast memory cards as it can shoot extremely quickly!
no wi-fi
difficult to find one, neck strap gets in the way although you could say that about any camera! a bit heavy for trekking but then you come away with great shots.
takes a while to find your way around the menu and controls of camera
expensive
transport tijd!!! 10 dagen
only 30 fps 1080p not 60, typically the canon branded accessories are very expensive for what they are - \xa380 for a battery charger (mains lead plus a plastic box to clip the battery into!)
non  so far
65 point autofocus takes a little getting used to for certain types of photo
heavy, some niggles re how the storeage cards are used, now fixed on the 1ds3. would like to see more control over drive, such as linking to frame bracketting. would be good to see more flexibility in terms of auto iso settings.
too titchy and made for people with hand like sparrows' feet. daft small capacity memory card and no battery charger.
plastic construction slightly flimsy feeling. quite a chunky feel as well, so not for the image concious who want to slip a camera in their pocket!
cover for usb cable
no bad points encountered so far but it is a bit bulky and heavier than previous cameras.  however, quality of pictures and zoom make up for this.
plastic feel to it
the most annoying thing about any digital camera... if you dont have rechargeable battery facitility, you will notice the battery life go really quickly.. therefore you will need to have a good stock of batteries (really annoying).
can't think of any
no bad points
small standard memory capacity
suspect that it is not the strongest camera
under the impression that the video option was better
focal length - would have liked to have been slightly wider at full zoom-out, but still very good for the price.
bit fiddly when you need to use the manual adjustments
can't fault it.
the first one i had had a defective function selector but the camera was replaced by dealer
we have not yet found a way of varying the flash by degrees. there is, of course, a flash control but my other camera has a control which allows 1/16, 1/8, 1/4 flash and red-eye reduction.
great camera though if dropped breaks easily and repairs cost more than camera is actually worth
nothing significant - a great camera
less easy to use from the point of it's many features, lcd not easy to see in bright light (and i don't just mean when it's really sunny)
advanced user instructions not available in printed form ( even at cost)
mode selector button became faulty after 4 months.
user guide not very good
uses more power than expected + needs rechargables.the memory card suplied is pitiful.
bit big and does not come in a carrying case.
slight difficulty in opening the card and battery storage
i find that the exposure time can be longer than expected, giving the subject time to move and become blurred
image quality can sometimes look a bit grainy, and doesn't defuse red-eye
manual controls are not easy to get at.
zoom switch feels flimsy. advanced manual is provided on cd but not in printed format.
software a bit dodgy with xp and canon help isn't much use. got a solution on the internet!

maybe a bit big but thats good for me i can handle it better and read things
the red eye reduction never seems to work and it would be nice if the camera came with a case.
non.
output  is a bit flymsy that's it.
no real problems found.
slightly disappointed in the quality of the images, seems to take a bit of time to reload itself after a photo has been taken
should come with carrier pouch to attach to your belt. could be a bit slimmer .
not as slim line as some so not quite as pocketable, small price to pay for the features though.
poor battery life especially with flash, no mains adapter or case included.
rechargable battery pack needed
i still think that the anti red eye function could be improved on a bit.the build could be a bit smaller as it is quite chunky.
too easy to select eg video: the back 'dial' should have larger or blacked-in icons
16 mb sd card not big enough
n/a
there are no bad points
the memory card is quite fiddly to get out of the camera and when its your new toy it makes it harder because you worried you might break the little catches! also some of the more detailed instructions about choosing the right feature for your camera are not very clear in the instruction booklet
16 mb sd card not big enough

the users manual is on a disc, and to be any use at all, must be printed on paper - an awfl lot of it!
neck strap would have been useful.
fiddly dial, not easily read
i cant really find a bad point .
i haven't found anything i would consider to be a disadvantage so far apart from the awkward position and size of the lens lock.  this is a minor point but with a heavy lens, it tends to extend itself by gravity when being carried, and i prefer to lock it to make it more compact.  and it's just a bit fiddly.
it's definitely not for someone who doesn't know their way around a digital slr, some people might find the settings finicky.
no lens cap provided in kit bundle.
i was having issues with overexposure when using flash and have to manually redure the flash exposure by 2 stops.
on/off switch a bit small to get hold of (particularly with gloves in this cold weather!)
the on off switch is awkward could have been push button.being left handed find my thumb keeps touching the lcd  screen as i begin to support the camara on raise to veiw although i am holding by the right hand grip.bad habit i will have to change,
setting aperture in manual mode is fiddly - need to both hold down a button and turn a dial.
view finder a bit small and awkward to use and would have prefered rechargable batteries
would have liked a user manual in paper rather than on cd !
sometimes not so hot at focussing, need to take a little time composing and targetting the main object. i often take pictures from a moving boat, which sometimes seems to 'fool' the focussing on distant landscapes. the lack of a viewfinder is the biggest problem. i had an earlier powershot which had a viewfinder and was absolutely invaluable in bright sunlight. some of the pictures i've taken were a bit point and hope, just couldn't make out the screen in any detail.
could do with a better grip on the side.
rating.
review of pictures could be easier when taking pictures
not found any.
battery is expensive - i don't use replacement batteries.
90-300 lens
the camara did not come with any memery card
very easy to change setting and not realise it.
small (16mb) memory card supplied - easily abd cheaply remedied. a low cost camera case would also be handy.
