OVF good, live view very good.  Nice to hold in hand. Very good ISO performance.  In my analysis and comparisons I rated this camera above Nikon D7000|#|Lenses very expensive (I've purchased 8 since xmas), LCD is not tiltable.  Range of lenses, although good, not nearly as good as Nikon/Canon.  Quite a complicated beast... need the Manual as PDF file and read it, again and again. Buying a DSLR may lead to Lens lust.

10.0|#|Having being a Nikon user since the APS DLSRs were released - I recently changed over to Micro Four Thirds because of the size. Then as I missed my DSLRs - I was reading the Awards for 2012 made by the What Digital Camera which gave the Pentax K30 the best APS DSLR Award for 2012 .  Without doubt  it is a super camera - the quality of the photographs are amazing - even at 3200 ISO and the kit lens is the best I have used on any DSLR - far superior to the Nikon and Canon versions.  I would recommend this camera to any one . I also purchased the 35mm Lens which is excellent|#|I only have one at present
9.0|#|Fantastic camera at an affordable price. Mine got it for quite cheap with WR kit lens. Going good so far. If you are interested in Macro photography at an affordable cost go for the Pentax Dslr as it is capable of accepting old film lenses. good luck with your purchase|#|pretty average with movies but thats not the intended use of this camera. for occassional video shoot it will do pretty well.

10.0|#|Great for amatuers and semi-professionals alike, rates up there with Nikon and Canon.  Easy to use controls, lightweight, good range of auto and manual selection, high ISO range, good crisp images.  I love the fact that it uses both a rechargeable battery and AA's within the same compartment.|#|The shutter is quite loud.  Being a user of the viewfinder, I don't like the feature of the green light flashing on the front when using live view but this can be turned off.
10.0|#|Allows use of AA batteries with an adapter. Weather/dust sealed. Old lenses can be used. Does everything I will ask it to do.|#|Can't think of any
10.0|#|This is an excellent testbed for vintage m42 lenses, the only sensible choice in fact. Pentax have engineered to make this possible, it is a great feature that massively enlarges the capability of this camera. I hope Pentax continue to understand the market this well, if they do I'll be a committed user.|#|

9.0|#|Feels fab in the hand and controls easy to reach, packed with features I have yet to master.  A beautiful little camera with great potential for future lenses.|#|Manual written far too small and I find it very difficult to read even with glasses. Was told of a website I could go on and read it in bigger print but dont want to have to go online everytime I get stuck and not much good when you are out and about.
9.0|#|High quality images, plenty of manual control, size and weight make it an ideal carry around camera capable of professional results. I use it for my business as a stock photographer.|#|Colour needs a little tweaking in post processing for my taste. Other than that only minor niggles - could do with a better camera strap, provided software is not that great - but there are plenty of alternatives
9.0|#|The K200D feels solid and has a bigger grip than many of the other cameras in it's class, and overall feels very well-made. The kit lens is not perfect, but it's a damn sight better than many other kit lenses (although shadows in the corners are apparent in very bright scenes). Buttons are all nicely located and the autofocus is good, although occasionally hunts in very dim light. Grain in photos is well controlled, and the minimum f3.5 on the kit lens means you don't often need a higher ISO setting. Images are often sharper on the computer screen than on the screen, which is odd. The front element of the lens does not rotate on zoom or focus, making it easier to use polarising filters, and the included lens hood is excellent. Image stabilisation is built in-body and is effective, and battery life is EXEMPLARY - I've yet to change the battery from the ones that were put in when I bought the camera and the battery meter still reads full. Fantastic.|#|The range of lenses made my Pentax is slightly more limited in terms of scope than similar cameras by Nikon or Canon, although Tamron and Sigma do a fair range for the K200D lens mount. However, I believe that availability will change with Pentax's increased focus on DSLRs. There is no additional front dial on the grip, and no AF assist lamp - it uses the flash.
9.0|#|Overall impression swamped by how good it is compared to my old compact.|#|Dial section for sgutter/aperture is going to take a bit of getting used to compared with my old Pentax ME Super!

9.0|#|All existing Pentax SLR lenses fit so it fits into existing sytem|#|Like all new technology a bit complicated for the over 60's
9.0|#|The best of the budget dSLRs out there at the moment.|#|Built-in flash is a bit weak but copes with most situations.  Serious users will buy a separate flash unit anyway, so this is far from being a deciding factor!  The mid tone can be lacking but is easily fixed within the individual photo type settings.
10.0|#|The image quality really does stand out and if thats what matters most you will not have buyers remorse with this camera.|#|Theres little to dislike about this camera, it does use AA batteries and these have there advantages as well as disadvantages, but that comes down to a matter of personal choice.  The price of the camera was a little expensive at launch, however prices have begun to fall now which makes the K-x a very desirable camera.
10.0|#|The compatibility with older Pentax fit lenses is another outstanding benefit.|#|Not providing lens hoods with the kit lenses

8.0|#||#|The only bad point is that you cannot charge this camera directly and batteries are not something that I would normally rely on. Also the second lens was missing a cover and I wondered if you could send me one as it's not practical to swap and change them using my one only other cover.
9.0|#|Having had a Pentax KX 35mm SLR since the 60's apart from the different feel of the Body, the operation of the Camara remains similar, it's just getting used to the functions. This is something that you can play with without wasting Film.|#|None so far

9.0|#|Very nice HD video once you have tinkered with the settings.|#|HD video recording limited to 12mins but it could be 15 like other cameras.
9.0|#|It was nice that I could switch easily from my 35mm Pentax camera. The basic functions were easy to master, without having to plough through the instruction manual! Now I am starting to explore some of the other digital functions, I am really impressed with what this camera can do.|#|Haven't found any bad points yet!!
8.0|#|Pentax supply a set of non-rechargeable lithium which will last even longer, so full marks for them.|#|Apart from video, there is very little to complain about.
10.0|#|Easy to use versatile camera with effects snd editing software, good for beginner/entusiast or just stick it on auto for great snapshots and came with 200mm zoom too!|#|p!
10.0|#|The camera is excellent value for money compared to other DSLRs in the entry-level range. The features and the ease of use of the camera, that doesn't stifle the ability to explore photography when moving up from compact and film cameras, has been great. Pentax also has a long legacy of lenses and this has ended up saving me a lot of money with the older lenses when compared to buying new lenses for other brands which would have cost me a small fortune. The image quality is brilliant and I expect to be using this camera for many years to come.|#|This would have to be the batteries. Make sure to buy rechargeables or you could find your hobby costing a lot more than you expected it to.
8.0|#|Not too heavy, clear screen for picture review, plenty of alternative photo modes uses standard AA battery size, useful zoom on the smaller of the 2 lenses .|#|screen is not detachable or rotatable for awkward shoots. Plethora of  settings available on the rear screen but probably do not have time to read the handbook to understand what they do. Prints produce a darker picture than the screen view.
8.0|#|I have bought this as a training camera, having upgraded finally from film. For the price, I can afford at some stage to either extend this range, or buy kit from another manufacturer for more specialist use.|#|

Used it for 4 solid days and still loads of power left. No problems with usage in hot humid climates. Features are those you would see on much more expensive DSLRs. Burst mode is mega-fast.|#|Im struggeling to get decent non shakey video. will have to investigate further. if on tripod quality of video is fantastic, it takes a bit of getting used too.

Very good quality images without the Point and shoot time lag.|#|Live view still too slow to use for anything apart from tripod work. No indication on the view finder of focus point. Can mean some out of focus shots and more changing of focus range (single to multi point).

7.0|#|Great bargain on price.  Only novice photographer so does enough for me.  Downloading to memory card instant, 4fps means you can capture fast moving images so much better than previous camera.  Only printed  one picture so far was expecting better a bit grainey but did zoom in and crop quite a bit, did pick up minute details though.|#|200mm zoom doesn't seem enough, could do with more
9.0|#|amazing value for money.|#|50-200 lens might be a little on the soft side.
10.0|#|right unlike some of the other SLRs I looked at and it's great to have a view finder again!  As far as I'm concerned it does exactly what it says on the tin.  Like it.|#|I know some reviews critised the battery life.  Personally I haven't been out long enough at one go yet for this to present a problem but there is always the option of carrying spare batteries so I can't see this bothering me.  The only, very minor, criticism I would make is that the camera doesn't come with a memory card.

9.0|#|A paper manual is supplied which gives extensive instructions on the different functions of which there are many. As a reasonably experienced amateur I am finding all of the features I had hoped for, and some unexpected ones.|#|viewfinder I find that the functionality in the display is much reduced from that available with my old EVF, for instance, I have to check the rear screen for a histogram rather than see it in the viewfinder. This means that I have to work differently and I guess it's all part of the learning process that comes with a different technology.

9.0|#|Good quality,easy to use.I have not had a chance to familiarize myself with all the features yet.|#|
9.0|#|Great entry level DSLR. Handles well in most conditions and has more than enough features to get you started. The price and inclusion of two zoom lenses makes this a real bargain.|#|None that I can find yet.

The 55-200mm is a brilliant zoom lens, pictures are great (ive been using this for sports photography and it takes some great shots. really crisp.)|#|I cant really find too many faults with the camera, im a beginner and dont have anything to compare it too! but ive been really happy with it so far.

9.0|#|This entry level DSLR is packed with a host of features that are available in costly DSLRs like Nikon D5000. Image quality is sharp and great. Startup and response times are excellent. Have not had any issues with the camera till now. Bought it for my Europe Trip. Came back with great pics :) Great value for money with the bundled lens. The only low side is the use of AA batteries. However, have heard from my friends that it gives acceptable number of shots with one charge. Yet to test it myself.|#|None so far
8.0|#||#|is very long.
10.0|#|All in all, this is just a fantatsic little all round camera. I would recommend it to anybody, but I can se it has more potential for nights out, concerts and music festivals, where you need alittle knockabout camera.|#|The image quality isn't amazing if you're comapring to a digital SLR, but it IS great for a little compact digi camera. And given all the other advantages (Shockproof, waterproof to 10ft, etc) it's TOTALLY worth it.

2.0|#|A light, compact and sytlish camera that took good quality images (until it stopped working).|#|After using for only about half an hour in the water, the camera display stopped working and then shortly afterwards the camera itself stopped working.  I was not impressed after spending what I considered a lot of money on a 'Waterproof' camera as a present because my husband wanted something for use whilst sailing and snorkelling
10.0|#|I dont write reviews as you can probably tell but this deserves one and I am quite happy to sing its praises.|#|Like i mentioned above, over distance with the zoom out picture quality does suffer some.. this is however the same with ANY similar camera and to be honest, we dont usually shoot pictures that far away, they are usually fairly close to us which then gives us very very high quality pictures to treasure.

Overall, a joy to use.|#|Give me a few months and I may come up with some but after only 6 weeks, can't think of any.
9.0|#|I bought a DSLR Pentax because I have been a Pentax SLR user for many years and have a collection of Pentax lens which may be used in the digital version.  Once I got used to its basic features I have found the camera easy to operate and have obtained good results.  The camera is very versatile and the features I have used can make for interesting images.  I particularly like the low-light capabilities and the ability to change ISO quickly to meet the circumstances.  Battery life seems to be good but I shall be buying the AA battery holder as an emergency stand-by.|#|The camera features are not really intuitive and  some of the buttons are a little fiddley.   I was forced to read the instructions in the initial stages of use.   However, I think this is because of the thirty or so years I have used a SLR and my difficulty in accepting that digital is totally different from film.  I still do not use the real time facility on the monitor.
9.0|#|I bought the Kr as I do a lot of low light work at high ISO. So far the camera seems usable to about 6400 ISO, but beyond this noise radidly becomes evident. The camera is light and seems well built for the price range. In camera stabilisation and dust reduction are welcome features, as is the depth of field preview. Autofocus in good light is very rapid. The firmware is lightning fast too. Overall it is packed with features that would have been found only on much more expensive models a few years ago. Haven't tried the 6fps burst rate yet but on paper that looks impressive too. Finally the Kr will shoot DNG Raw files as well as Pentax's own version od Raw.|#|In camera effects mode is a bit gimmicky for my taste

9.0|#|Making the jump from compact camera to DSLR? This camera is ideal, easy to use pictograms to get started, then as you get confident, use the manual settings. Great quality photo's every time.

10.0|#|Love that you can chose the focus points al well|#|Would always go for pentax over canon although it is more expensive for a very simular camera. Just because of the casing which doesnt feel plasticy and the system, but it does mean the pentax is more for perhaps the same quality photo.

9.0|#|For me it is the anti shake firstly. I am now able to take photo's again without the use of a mono/tripod as I have a slight tremor in my hands. The quality of the photo's is good however I have also purchased a Tamron AF 70-300 lens and the quality of photo's taken with that is noticable better than with the pentax lens supplied with the camera.|#|The Pentax lens quality is not quite up to what I expected compared to the Tamron I have bought.
10.0|#|Has lots of features (see also below) Excellent value for money.|#|Difficult to focus with non-auto focus lenses so existing lenses are of very limited value. Residual problem is that there is not a wide range of auto-focus Pentax lenses to suit. So many features available that are also on processing software so are wasted in making the operation more complex in other than simple modes.
9.0|#|Great features for the money, Uses AA batteries,SD cards and old Pentax lenses. Very happy with my Pentax, buy one you won't be disapointed. 6 Mpix is enough. Hard to beat.|#|Noithing bad to say still all warm and fuzzy about this camera.. After 7000 shots.
9.0|#|Good manual supplied and good Pentax web-site giving helpful hints on use.|#|None really, though it seems to be heavier on batteries than I had expected. Probably no worse than other models in this respect though. Not a great problem with rechargeables unless I go on a long holiday away from a ready source of power.

9.0|#|Easy to pick up and start using as a DSLR goes, excellent feel in hands. Can't fault image quality. For the beginners the AUTO mode is great, but the camera comes to life using the A,S and M modes. Shutter on the loud side, but I like that - feels very solid, just like my old Minolta and Pentax's used to... Shake reduction really works - sharp pictures at as low as 1/8!|#|As mentioned above, slightly louder mirror release than rivals - not a camera to sneak around with. Dedicated RAW and White Balance buttons would be welcome, but then again this camera does have the K10D as the older brother.
6.0|#|The camera is fine to use and does function more than adequately.|#|The camera is not easy to use as a manual focus SLR with the standard lens- which was a significant reason for my buying it- and doesn't therefore offer much over a compact.  I would not recommend it as a choice over a good campact other than to fairly dedicated SLR users.
10.0|#|Exellent picture quality, I take shots for our Music Society, and they are usually low ligh level, with 3200 ASA I get some great shots. With film this would be very very grainy, the quality is exellent even blowing up to 18x12|#|I havent found a bad point yet, this is my first digital SLR, having alredy owned a compact digital, previously they were too expensive for me to justify the cost.

10.0|#|Great little starter SLR camera, lovely pictures and easy to use for learners moving across to SLR's. for what it is great little all rounder. overall 5 stars.|#|Shutter speed, close ups, if your going to do detailed work then investment on further leans will be needed to be made, thats fine, but if on a budget then the cost jumps, and may put people off.
9.0|#|The Pentax K100D is very easy to use using the fully automatic mode. In difficult lighting situations the camera is very adaptable to get the best possible pictures using the pre-selections available.  For the adventurist photographer full manual modes are possible.  It is the only digital camera I have ever used that gave me excellent photos of a grand firework display.|#|Like all DSLRs the camera is prone to getting dust on sensor which can cast shadows on the final image.  The advice that Pentax gives to use a blower to shift the dust specs away do not work in my case.  The cost of getting the dust removed is high so I wait until a cheap diy solution is available.

Occasional exposure problems but again not too much of an issue.
8.0|#|good for close up work|#|not always easy to see image on screeen in bright light
9.0|#|Build quality is outstanding for the pricepoint. The image quality is as good as Nikon and Canon, and in some cases better. If your on a tight budget the K10D is probably the best choice for a semi professional DSLR.|#|You do need to play with it to get the pics you want. Straight out of the box shooting will not yeild the best results. So for quick snaps - not great. This camera is definately for the experienced photographer. Choice of lenses and third part products not as extensive as the top two camera makes.

9.0|#|I was able to take pictures as soon as I had unpacked the camera - and read the manual!  This was using Green mode and am now experimenting with the other options.|#|The battery indicator does not give you much warning when the battery is due for charging.

9.0|#|compact and nice handling- typical Pentax.All Pentax lenses fit albeit with some restrictions-see below.Found it easy to use after using film Pentax models.results in available light have been excellent. exposure meter very sensitive. Battery life good.Camera has not been tested in variety of lighting conditions yet. At last an excellent digital slr for the pentax faithful. There is life other than Nikon and Canon despite what the journals say.|#|older Pentax flash not compatible-even previous top flash unit 500FTZ.screen not easy to read in daylight-may not be worse than other cameras. when using aperture ring on older lenses only manual metering available- I would have expected aperture priority at least- maybe there is but I haven't found it yet!
10.0|#|Comparable in  use with the LX, the best SLR Pentax, or anyone else perhaps, ever produced.|#|The software support for RAW format is limited. Good image adjustment but no quick crop or straighten.

The results so far are all that I expected.|#|None, really, apart from the manual, which is a dog's dinner of a book, and doesn't open flat, which means that you need at least three hands.

10.0|#|Great to be able to take it snorkling, down water slides on rivers ect and not worry about it. it adds a whole arena for  taking pictures and videos. There loads of fun features like meowing shutter sounds, alarm clock and special effects. The compact size is also good fits nicly in the pocket. The time lapse feature and the panorama thing is fun too allowing you to get creative.|#|The screen is vunrable to scratches, it seems quite proud and would have been better re-cessed like the lens is, mine got scratched on the first day.  Picture quality is not as good as my old cyber shot but i like been able to take it anywhere which i could not do with my old camera. the video quality is also not super sharp especially if you use the zoom.
9.0|#|Very good value for money. I got this camera only for holidays, but I haven't gone yet, so I didn't test it. But I saw pictures on the internet and they are just fine. Just for fun, is more than enough. I am comparing to a Panasonic TZ-7 which I always have with me, and some Canon SLRs... HD video is fine. Zoom would also be nice during video.. Better (harder) built quality than the w60. (check the edges) If you have children, or your are the type of person who drops things all the time, get on! :-) If you can pay more, check also the competition. W90 is too expensive. If you are thinking of pentax, get the W80.|#|Toooo much noise. If you are used to better brands, (...) you will be a bit disappointed. Zoom on video, as mentioned before. Battery life could be better. If I remember well, this type of battery is very old. Check also, if you find a good discount, the FT1.

5.0|#|The environment of water is good, if that is your main object. Under water pictures holds better up in quality compared to the ordinary use.

9.0|#|This is a fantastic little SLR - even more so as I bought it as a kit with 18-55 and 55-300mm lenses.  Build quality is good, the only possible minus being carbon plastic mounts on the lenses, but this is really only an issue if you're a press photographer or plan to scale Everest with the camera hanging off your rucksack!  Handling is fine, although those with large hands (which I don't have) may find the diminutive size of the camera makes for fiddly button pressing.  That diminutive size, though, is another plus as this really is a very compact SLR and will fit into a small camera bag or pouch with no problem.  The fast (4.7 FPS) autodrive is terrific, meaning that, at a recent airshow, I got better shots than I've ever managed before, capturing even low flying fast jets, pin-sharp.  Where the camera really scores, though, is picture quality - sharp, 12.4MP photos with realistic colours and that 3D quality that makes the image seem to jump off the computer screen.  All in all, a little gem, which I am very glad I bought.|#|The most annoying point for me is that the button to switch from taking to viewing pictures is situated at a point where my nose sometimes presses it accidently, changing mode unwittingly!  Now, I don't have a large nose, but I do shoot looking through the viewfinder with my left eye, so if you are a right-eyed photographer, it won't be a problem.  Other downsides are that the Live-View, like many SLRs, is not much cop, and although the viewfinder tells you the camera has focused (with a green hexagon lighting up) it doesn't indicate exactly what it's focused on.  I haven't found this too much of a problem - the viewfinder is sharp and bright enough to be able to see for yourself - but some might miss the confirmation.
9.0|#|Excellent value and build quality. The 18 to 55mm kit lens is incredible and wish I had gone for the extra lens kit when I bought the camera. Having progressed from film SLR to compact digitals many years ago, I thought it would be some time before I could produce high-quality images without using all the automatic features, but to my surprise, with a bit of guidance from both my sons who are DSLR users, I was producing crisp and beautiful images in less than a week of use. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a more professional camera than the entry level Canon, Sony or Nikons, which I understand users soon outgrow.|#|Haven't found any yet.
9.0|#|Generally a very good camera for value. I found it easy to use and with the high ISO rating it takes excellant night shots. I read a professional review of this camera and I found it a bit unfair to state that the lithium AA batteries only lasted a DAY!! My batteries have been in the camera since purchase ( about 4 weeks ) and still indicate as fully charged.I have so far taken about 200 photos on these batteriesThere is an issue with battery drainage but not in normal SLR use e.g ( not using 'Live View ) - using live view is a heavy drain on the batteries, why this is so, I don't know when you consider Compacts use live view all the time!! The camera itself is solidly built and well finished in its various colours - mine is BLUE.|#|Apart from the Live View the only other gripe I have is there  is no remote socket!!

The features are excellent and and easy to use and my results are improving all the time.  Should have changed long before now!|#|None so far (and hopefully never!)
9.0|#|The camera is relatively compact and light which makes it great for travelling, also the many auto settings makes it easy to take great pictures even if you are an SLR photography novice like me. Although I admit I am no photography expert, to my eye I believe the pictures taken with the Pentax are of great quality and the in-built editing features make it easy to crop, rotate and apply fun digital filters to photos.|#|The only bad point is that the camera requires 4 AA batteries and does not have a built in rechargable battery. But this can also arguably be a good point as it means that if ever you are running low on batteries no matter where you are it is easy to get new ones.
8.0|#|Light but still feels sturdy. Nicely balanced. Easy to use Menu. I bought the Pentax K-X  to take Photo's of my Dogs on the move.

Seems more complicated than my old camera but this is probably the difference between digital and film and not this camera's fault. The autofocus seems a bit on the noisy side, but then again I haven't got any thing to compare it with.
9.0|#|A Beautifully made camera and fits in the hand comfortably. It has a host of features more than i have found out how to acces/use.The lens is fantastic and the body is just right with  buttons in the right places. this is my first venture into a digital slr and i am loving handling the camera and taking good photo's.Very pleased with the price i paid  (cannot mention here) which included a set of eneloope batteries..Well pleased i bought it...|#|Perhaps a little too complicated for a non technophobe like me having been used to auto/manual film camers (pentax me super) so i am on a steep learning curve but happily doing so. As of now have still not managed to be able to use a  non auto focus manual lens, i am sure it is feasable...

9.0|#|Great for all the family to use with realy impresive results. From the Auto Pict mode for the kids the the fully programable settings for those special shots. Great camera with superb features for a very reasonable price. Other majors available in the price range (Canon etc...) but always seemed tobe a compromise on features compared to that of the Pentax K-R. Plays in the hand very well where with other brands had to keep dropping the camera to see where my fingers were.|#|None so far!!
9.0|#|Easy to use (but I am still working out some of the digital extras);  excellent optics;  lightweight;  I can use my Pentax K-A lenses with it;  so far the video is excellent (didn't buy it for that);  good low light shooting.  All-in-all I'm well pleased with it.|#|Close-ups using the the macro could be tighter, but to be fair, the enlargements are excellent.  I can't understand why the manufacturers don't include a camera bag as standard.
10.0|#|Overall there are too many good points to list.|#|The manual is quite small print but you can download a pdf version from the Pentax site and so when you read it it is not a strain to the eyes. Keep the printed version for when you're out and about.

10.0|#|I would highly recommend this camera to everyone. It`s our first DSLR camera and we can learn a lot while using it. It is very easy to use but it has so many features that once you are more advanced, you can definitely discover its advanced programmes. It is very small and light so great to hold. There is a wide range of accessories available, spare lenses etc which fit this camera. There is nothing we would change or improve.|#|

To take a great photo, you don't really HAVE to do anything more than press the button, but comprehensive adjustment options are available if you wan to use them. I don't really know enough about cameras to give a full analysis but no complaints so far, it's doing exactly what it's supposed to as far as I can tell, and doing it very well at that!|#|Well, to be honest I don't really think there are any bad points. I mean, the camera is covered with buttons which can be quite intimidating at first, and the instruction manual isn't the best one I've ever read, but it's pretty newbie-friendly and you can pretty much just play around, pressing whatever you want and seeing what it does without really messing anything up so yeah, overall I'm very happy with it.

6.0|#|The price was very good for a 10mp camera. Some of the features such as editing on the camera and applying effects added a fun element.|#|I personally felt that i got better quality prints from my 7.2mp casio. The camera felt a bit cheap and not very robust.
1.0|#|excellent quality of  photo's, good very sturdy build, convenient size, lens quality.|#|only one bad point which spoils all the good ones, no viewfinder, the screen is absolutely useless in anything resembling sunlight which is just what one needs to take good pics, cannot frame a pic,because of reflective glare from screen, did not realise this before purchase, have since purchased a similar camera with a viewfinder.

5.0|#|has a nice feel to handle and operate|#|the LCD screen cannot be seen outdoors in daylight therefore without an optical viewfinder it becomes a point and hope operation which is very unsatisfactory.
10.0|#|great size camera, great quality photos and real ease of use.|#|not really any bad points but if i am to be picky then i guess it is a little heavy in weight, it is a little hestitant when flicking through photos, and sometimes the photos can be blurry.
7.0|#|the camera does take a nice clear picture and the battery life is quite good as well there is a zoom but the picture quality is not as good when you use it.|#|sometimes it can be quite hard to use the camera if you have it on certain modes the focus point jumps about alot and you have lost the picture before you take it and sometimes it does not even take the picture.

9.0|#|The Optio A30 delivers superb pictures and is easy enough to use straight from the box. It's rich in features, and particularly worth noting are the Digital Anti Shake and the excellent face Recognition, both of which gave excellent results even in low light situations. This great little camara also has DivX Video Compression on board, enabling you to achieve some of the smoothest video footage I have ever seen on a compact digital camera, and lots of it too. If you want to get a little more adventurous, the camera has many great fully manual controlled features, so I am quite sure as my photo skills grow, this camera will be able to keep up. It's a great little machine!|#|The camera starts up very quickly, but gives the best results when you take a second or two to compose yourself, and be sure to switch off the excellent face recognition when taking shots of landscapes or 'busy' shots (there are specific settings for this kind of shot anyway.) Also, as with most cameras of this compact size, be sure to place the camera strap around your wrist. Although the camera feels solid in the hand, it's still a very small machine, and doesn't weigh much, so take my advice and be careful holding it.
8.0|#|Quick and easy to use lots of functions|#|Not sure how long some of the side covers will last they just seem to be attached by bits of elastic!  Bit slow to take multiple pictures - i was expecting very quick pictures - you sometimes lose the moment
10.0|#|You can start using it easily right away with the auto mode and it take good pictures|#|You can't zoom in or out whilst filming
7.0|#|Very small and light with quite a few features. The picture quality (at 10 MP) is excellent and the shake reduction feature also works pretty well.|#|The interface offered on the Pentax is not fantastic - it does take some getting used to. It also probably could be tightened up to improve it and not bury some of the features down and out of the way quite so much.
1.0|#|Sadly, I was extremely disappointed by this camera's quality of photos.  As I like to take the majority of photos on automatic I would say this camera is not for the novice.  When my photos were developed most were extremely dark and mostly out of focus.  Compared to my previous camera of 4 megapixels the prints were half the quality.  In fact, I now have another camera as what's the point of having hopeless photos.|#|Does not take satisfactory photos on automatic.  No view finder makes it difficult to take photos in the sunshine.

Not such a downside once you get used to this, particularly considering the amazing ease of use and quality of the camera and images, but sometimes a view-finder would be handy!  Having said this, the screen is large and very clear, so as mentioned not too much of a downside.

10.0|#|Great camera for such a small price.|#|








9.0|#|Really solid, quality feel. Lenses have a lovely mechanical action and overall the camera just feels made to much more exacting standards than Canon or Nikon. Images are good quality and ISO ranges can be pushed pretty high with out being affected by noise. Can use old Pentax fit lenses on the body, some of which push the image quality right up to super fine levels. Battery seems to last forever. I travel a lot, and in some pretty crazy humidity, rain, heat and dust, snow and ice the camera has worked perfectly every time.|#|Ever so slightly over exposes sometimes if you trust the exposure bar in the viewfinder.
9.0|#|Excellent instruction book (300+ pages) - easy to understand.  Camera easy to handle and very versatile.  Kit lenses so far performed much better than expected, especially telephoto zoom - very impressed with technical quality.   Some professional reviews have commented about fall-off in quality (excessive noise) at ISO of over 1000 - certainly haven't noticed it so far.  Shake reduction feature works well.  Camera seems pretty robust.  Price wise, good value compared with similar models from Canon and Nikon.|#|Lens coupling mechanism not quite as smooth as it might be.  Otherwise, nothing.
10.0|#|. The main settings very easy to alter and other settings accessible through the comprehensive menu system. A good range of lenses available and many Pentax SLR lenses can be used with this camera so if you have a previous model it is less expensive to upgrade to the K-7.|#|None so far

9.0|#|on the camera. Now saving up for a different lens.|#|Couldn't find the right size case for this (although probably not looking hard enough) so bought a cheap standard camera bag which is too big for this camera. The dial on the top is sometimes fiddly but you get used to it.


9.0|#|- green button - shortcuts for advanced users or idiot proof photo mode for amateurs|#|- even though you can charge battery using regular USB charger, the camera USB input is not a standard mini USB or micro USB, so you can't use your smartphone/tablet car charger and you have to remember about aditional cable with a proper plug for your USB wall charger when you go for holidays

9.0|#|Hi Res, compact, Li battery and great value for money.|#|Not the highest quality, or the most comprehensive features, but for that you would have to pay a lot more.
10.0|#|Excellent camera for the money. Image quality is excellent and the range of exposure options is good. Large, clear lcd screen. Camera is very slim and weighs very little which means you are more likely to take it with you. Movie mode is exceptional with great quality images.|#|None
9.0|#|Waterprooof, looks good. Lots of functions, solid build, great for holidays on the beach|#|Lack of black and white photo mode. People look at you like your crazy when taking it into the sea!
8.0|#|This was bought as an underwater camera to take snorkelling and it does the job well. It automatically locks the battery/memory card holder and can be used underwater for 2 hours at a stretch, thus representing a great improvement on the Optio W10. Its easy to use as it doesn't need an underwater casing and takes decent pictures - certainly far better than a disposable underwater camera. I seem to be one of the lucky ones whose camera doesn't leak and I would recommend testing it extensively before heading off for that diving trip.|#|mode, for example?).
8.0|#|Superb picture quality|#|Chrome finish body is too slippery for an outdoor camera - especially one that doesn't float!

10.0|#|Very easy to use , takes very good pic's|#|non- so far!


8.0|#|The camera being waterproof - we can take pictures anywhere without worrying about the camera|#|none it seems a great camera
8.0|#|ease of use|#|

9.0|#|We had two non waterproof Optio's - the first one failed within 9 months (the second we lost).    We need a small light and robust compact to give us reasonable size and qulaity photos.  The documented poorer qaulity of the waterproof Optio with the zoom mechanism all encased has not been apparent to us.  Furthermore this lates 6MP version seems to respond faster.|#|heel - grit sand seems to quickly wreck the mechanism.  No view finder - screen is difficult to use on bright conditions (eg the beach).  Dedicated and expensive batteries / chargers (but we have several spares!).  Not as fast and responsive as a Fuji.
10.0|#|Great Camera, purchased it for a trip to florida and Disney.  It coped very well at disney for the family photos, it survived the water parks and it lso survived the week swiming and fishing (wadeing) of Ann Marie Island.  Fab camera!|#|Don't use the flash under water, it just clouds the picture.  Also when it had had a long day in the see, there was an issue with night time flash later that same day, suspect condensation.  otherwise love it and carry it all the time when the 35mm is to big.

8.0|#|It is an easy to use camera. I bought it for my 13year old daughter for her birthday.  She got it out of the box and used it immediately.  The picture quality is ideal for her use and the colours are much better than the last camera she had.  She can download and use the photos easily.|#|She has yet to mention any bad points.
9.0|#|this camera is a stylish and easy to use unit with great functions. it was recommended to me by a friend and i too would highly recommend this product to any potential buyers.|#|only one bad point and a minor one at that. it is a little easy to delete photos if you are on a night out and have had a shandy or two - just be wary. though this is probably more user fault than product fault!
3.0|#|Frames|#|Poor quality of pictures
10.0|#|Not being a very technical person, I have found this camera very simple to use.  I have learnt some of the features, and my kids seem to know the rest!|#|Don't think there are any!
4.0|#|Fairly cheap. Simple to use.|#|Very slow shutter release. Doesn't take the photo you thought you took. Poor image colours.
8.0|#|It has really good image quality and performs well. It is reliable and has a long battery life.|#|It is really difficult (badly positioned) to use some of the controls, i.e. moving from AF to MF is uncomfortable. Some of the settings take a while to get to know, once you get to grips with the camera it is fairly simple to use.
10.0|#|Improved overall qualtity compared to K10.Extraordinary value for money.|#|None
8.0|#|most pre digital pentax lenses fit it|#|can be a bit slow when focusing
9.0|#|This is an excellent camera with just loads of features, Highly recomended!!|#|I have not so far found anything bad about this camera
10.0|#|Almost everything is good. The K10D was a really outstanding camera and this improves on it with a new technology for the capture of the image a brighter viewfinder and several other features like lots of seals to protect it from adverse weather|#|None really except that I wish it were made of light alloy instead of polycarbonate as I am very frightened of dropiing it as my k!0d suffered this fate and the case broke un was not repairable
10.0|#|High resolution images can be used in auto mode for the novice or in manual.  Produces great results.|#|Price is too high really,  The range of lenses available for Pentax cameras is less than that of Nikon or Canon.
9.0|#|Excellent ergonomic design and features.  Very good value in its class.|#|Build quality of the rear switches  same as on lower-range models and I fear may prove unreliable.  Auxiliary mains lead expensive (non-standard socket) and difficult to obtain.
10.0|#|Have not mastered the intricacies and all of the mass of tools available on this camera as yet, being a bit of a technophobe, but for what I needed it for it has been brilliant. Got great motorsport photo's, great wildlife photos, family photos etc, all round excellent photo's for everything you could use it for. Build quality is excellent in my opinion. Standard features are simple and easy to use. Used my existing lenses with it no problem at all. Always used a standard SLR but cannot see me going back to it now i've finally gone digital. I am very very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it for someone going digital for the first time and who wants great photos without too much trouble.|#|Not found any yet

9.0|#|Fantastic build quality, the weatherproofing is a major plus. The battery life is superb, I'm 1300 shots in and still on the original set of batteries. The designers have really thought about the controls and usage of the camera, it very quickly becomes intuitive. A great piece of kit.|#|The 18-55 Pentax kit lens isn't the best - it seems to lack sharpness and the AF has a tendency to hunt at low light levels.
9.0|#|In overall, I'm very happy with it.|#|Should pay attention to with which kit lens it has been sold. Purchased  Pentax DA SMC 18-55 mm kit lens is Mk1 and not recently re-done Mk2 by Pentax. A bit of disappointment.

9.0|#|Superb image quality and zoom range.|#|Zoom adjustment lacks fine tuning. A small touch on the zoom level gives a large leap in picture size.

8.0|#|The zoom lens, able to photo objects at closely and at a distance. Easy to use and navigate your way around the functions. Generally, the image quality is pretty good for such a reasonably priced camera. the pixel size is good and so is the HD video facility.|#|.
7.0|#|Takes nice pictures, is quite small and light, has a time lapsed multiple picture mode which is pretty good for such a cheap camera.  So ideal camera to take on holiday as you wont really be that worried about losing it.|#|Feels cheap and poorly built.
10.0|#|all|#|none
9.0|#|.|#|The learning curve starts easy, which is good, but then steepens and appears so high I'm not sure I'll ever reach the sunlit uplands of a plateau!
9.0|#|Integration of ISO adjustment within mode selection. Important controls are on the body not hidden in menus. Compact and lightweight, yet robust. Fast autofocus, quiet shutter. Access to compact prime lenses. Saves RAW files in DNG format. Shake reduction built into camera body.|#|Not enough notice of low battery status - indicator seems to vary between top panel and rear LCD display in live view mode..
10.0|#|I previously owned a Pentax 1st. On the K7 I particularly like the large display and the rapid fire continuous focussing facility.|#|Just as on other Pentax cameras (the 1st for example), it is far too easy to accidentally turn the front e-dial and change the shutter speed. I have resorted to taping it up although if I thoroughly read the manual it may well be possible to lock the speed electronically.
8.0|#|solid construction. Small size|#|None
9.0|#|Good lens|#|Not brilliant in low light
9.0|#|Perfect camera for me. Takes awsum HD video. Needs a neoprene case with it, Great at parties, a real ice breaker...drop it into your beer and take a photo out of the glass,,, get you a fee pint!. Highly reccommended. Simply is good to deal with.  Best price|#|Battery life ... always carry a spare battery and SD card.
9.0|#|Perfect gift for my 8 yr old son.  He uses loads of the functions without ever having looked at the manual.    Robust.  I can't really judge image quality at a fine level - totally fit for son's purpose. A lot of fun.|#|

8.0|#|This camera is very good value for money. took some really good underwater photos whilst snorkelling. Very pleased with them.|#|Hard to see screen when underwater
8.0|#|ease of use and waterproof feature|#|suffers in low lighting conditions
9.0|#|Versatile, compact, good value, loads of features AND WATERPROOF!  Unbeatable.|#|None yet.
1.0|#|Looks good and has a large viewing screen.|#|Bottom line is that it makes no difference how good the other aspects of the camera are if the images it produces are poor then the camera is of little use to me.
