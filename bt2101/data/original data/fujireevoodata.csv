9.0|#|Point and shoot. All you need for holiday snaps|#|No memory card included in the price
9.0|#|Has a lot of features which are easy to understand, can also be set so it can just be switched on and take pictures without any knowledge of its vast options on quality, picture size, effects and zoom. What I liked about it is the zoom lens is internal so nothing to break if knocked over. Is also waterproof for outside work.|#|

10.0|#|can take photos in the rain; can be dropped and be protected; pictures can be manually programmed or automatic and there are lots of options. ease of use. the good points far out weigh the three listed negative issues.|#|Although it has an anti-shake device, it is initially hard to find. One simply has to click on everything to find out what the items do. it only comes with a wrist strap, whereas a neck lanyard whilst hardly costing much more would have been useful, ditto a basic case.
8.0|#|Easy to use took it canyoning sea kayaking swimming scuba diving (shallow) took great photos for the price of the camera.|#|On off button can be a little awkward as small, not easy to find underwater
8.0|#|Compact, light, good variety of colours|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use. It is waterproof!|#|Macro focus was not that good. You do not have all the bells and whistles of a non waterproof camera for the same price, but you make that choice to drop some of the added value things.

9.0|#|Easy to use to get great photos. The macro even though it is not as much as some other cameras Is more than good enough.|#|
9.0|#|Outstanding image quality straight out of camera - best jpegs I have ever seen, without having to process them at all.  White balance perfect.. Compatibility with Leica and Zeiss lenses ( with adapter ) - works brilliantly giving full manual focus. Overall look of photos superb. High ISO performance second to none.  Pro camera - Pro results|#|Digital level innacurate. (same as my x100).  Slightly too expensive. Big downer is NO DIOPTRE ADJUSTMENT.  If you are even slightly off on vision, viewfinder blurred. I cannot find the recommended adjustment lenses anywhere - Fuji do not stock them. This is very bad.
9.0|#|Impeccable quality, good lenses, ability to take SLR lenses via an adapter, good looks. I bought it with a free 2 lenses deal and got the standard pancake lens plus the 28 mm equivalent.|#|Nothing except perhaps too expensive without the free lens offer.
9.0|#|Manuel focus very easy and accurate with zoom function.|#|None, might be the non full frame format.
10.0|#|Absolutely brilliant camera. The image quality and high ISO performance of the X Trans cameras are beyond any other APS-C camerad out there at the moment and the build quality is just levels above the competition with all-metal construction and well-operating engraved dials. The X-Pro1's hybrid viewfinder is a joy to use and this camera really succeds in making photography as fun as possible. I've moved to the Fujifilm X system from Nikon DSLRs and I'm entirely happy I did: the range of lenses available is already amazing and Fuji are regularly putting out new additions and the bodies get regular and meaningful updates. I couldn't recommend it more.|#|The additional features that you would find on a current DSLR aren't necessarily there or as good (e.g. interval shooting is unavailable and the video mode is lackluster) but if pure photography is what you want these things don't really matter.
9.0|#|Fantastic build quality....looks and feels very compact and i love the asthetic and feel for the camera.|#|The auto focus......its not quite there in the responsive way i would expect....am i correct in thinking that a software update is avialble to improve this on my model or would my model already have this software update ?
9.0|#||#|Of these only the AF is a real drawback
10.0|#||#|auto-focus is not very impressive
5.0|#|Fantastic image quality, Fuji files are really lovely straight out of the camera. Images taken with the 35mm F1.4 are very sharp. Nice small camera.|#|Auto focus not the best, I have a Fuji X100 so this came as no great surprise.
10.0|#|Image quality is stunning  and handling is great with or without the extra grip|#|No diopter correction lens build in you have to buy  separately to suit your own eye sight , cant reprogramme  buttons for your own need
9.0|#|Fantastic image quality, some of the best JPEGs you'll see. A proper photographers camera, Leica quality but without the price tag. Lenses are great too.|#|Q).

10.0|#|A great camera, well built, solid and produces great quality images. Spend time learning how to use it and you won't be disappointed.|#|

8.0|#|compact camera, professional results|#|
9.0|#||#|bad sofware for the raw
9.0|#|Fantastic image quality. M mount adapter has allowed use of Leica lenses. Great build quality.|#|Focus sometimes difficult, but improved with new firmware.
10.0|#|Using the xpro-1 feels like YOU are in control and not the camera software, such a dream to use.|#|Can't really think of any, as long as you know it's not an all singing dancing camera then you can't go wrong. You are the Photographer in charge not the camera and at the end of the day it's the excellent image quality which is what we all aspire to, with the Xpro-1 is exactly what you get.
9.0|#|Fantastic control of the image by easy use of exposure control. Build quality is just like cameras used to be in the days of Rolliflex - ie up to pro standards. Great image results.|#|Too easy to accidentally operate menu options when shooting. Though, I feel this is a common fault with many digital cameras.
8.0|#|It isn't at all, it's a really really good camera, it's just not perfect - for me...|#|The thumb dial at the back of the camera is too easily turned also, not a problem with most lenses but on the 27mm (no aperture ring) the aperture gets changed easily because of it.
9.0|#|Excellent picture quality|#|
10.0|#|Fast focusing you do not miss those important expressions. Easy to use.  Switching between shutter,  aperature priority, manual. Synch flash to 4000th/sec, balance light.  Shutter release accepts release cable, etc.|#|I have not yet observed any bad points.
9.0|#|Lightweight|#|Not for the novice
9.0|#|An incredible camera - image quality is sublime, build quality excellent|#|Menus are a bit complicated
9.0|#|Beautiful design and a great v.near DSLR pro quality output from a tiny compact package. The fixed lens forces you to think and compose your shot and will improve your photography. This is a very high quality take-anywhere.|#|Although the lens is excellent, this isn't a low-light camera in the evening for anything other than still(ish) subjects. Even ISO 6400 with the f/2 lens doesn't appear to cut it. But hey, this is a great camera.
8.0|#|Excellent Image quality,manual focus with AE button override and focus point magnification,exposure compensation dial.|#|Should be £600
9.0|#|Incredible image quality, opportunities to adjust exposure. Having a fixed focal length makes you think about your photos and how to really get the best from a photographic image.|#|None of note yet.
9.0|#|Superb low light capabilities.|#|Tendancy to underexpose in many lighting situations- need always to be ready to boost exposure +1 or even +2
8.0|#|- Despite what many people say, the innards are vastly improved over the X100.|#|- The Fuji accessories are way overpriced.
8.0|#|W.  High quality build, feels like a traditional rangefinder camera with engraved metal controls, small and light, perfect for  travelling.  Dual hybrid viewfinder works really well.|#|Quirky software that takes getting used to, but it works.  Buttons do different things under different settings so can be confusing. The adaptor ring needed for filters is a pain and when fitted the camera will not fit in the otherwise excellent leather case.  Sometimes a bit too slow to fire up and catch fleeting moments.
9.0|#|Superb build quality. Amazing image quality. Very good and useful features.|#|Price is a little bit on the high side but you are getting an awful lot of camera for your money
10.0|#|Little features that make life easier like built in nd filter, focus peaking etc.|#|Short battery life
10.0|#|Everything that needed adjusting on the x100 has been updated and made better. Enough to warrant the upgrade, especially the manual focus.|#|Have yet to find any
9.0|#|Stunning image and overall build quality.|#|Would have liked to have seen a slightly faster lens and the plastic scroll wheel is still terrible (though not a deal breaker)
9.0|#|flash system. It's an excellent backup for my large bridge camera (Fuji X-S1) and has the same image sensor in a much smaller package.|#|The only major omission is an optical viewfinder - even a small one would make a huge difference to ease of use.  Also the very good maximum aperture of f1.8 at wide angle falls off rapidly as you zoom out, but this doesn't cause any real problem in practical situations.
8.0|#|Build quality|#|Fiddly switching on and off

Simple to operate but super picture quality. love the fact that you can get quality pictures from a camera that fit sin your pocket.|#|I dont know if I was unlucky but two camera that didnt work properly. fine for the first week but then major issues. Interstingly the cameras on show had made in Japan written on them but the cameras I received were made in China!
10.0|#|Excellent composure and light control. Avery useable and effective camera in all situations of need.|#|I would have prefererred to have had its own bag included - as I have been unable to find a suitable one at local outlet.
10.0|#||#|No accessory shoe
8.0|#|Advanced settings... Vintage look.|#|
8.0|#|Stylish, with comprehensive auto and full manual controls. Excellent in low light, but seems a bit heavy on batteries. The lens on-off mechanism may frustrate at times, but my wife loves the camera overall.|#|

8.0|#|Good resolution|#|Longer lens would be preferred
1.0|#|Great image quality for the price if you can keep it working for long enough|#|Broke due to a software error related to the pop up lens. Common problem, Fuji refusing to acknowledge it. Took it back within 2 days for a full refund.
9.0|#|Quality of photos|#|Didn't come with a case
8.0|#|Many good points but needs patience to understand what to use and when to use them. I think there are too many for some. but if you want them they are there, getting the camera ready to use has to be operated with a lot of patient skill needs to develop so that it can done without thinking or watching.|#|Not really except it can be some time before I can and will use everything it contains.
9.0|#|Lots of features, suitable as point and shoot or serious photographer. Fuji customer support is excellent. Well build, compact slips into pocket.|#|Zoom is only 4 +4. Owner's manual is difficult for a novice.
9.0|#|Power on - unique|#|Power on - too easy to go past the initial 25mm setting
9.0|#|Great image quality|#|Unlocking the lens is a little quirky, but you soon get used to it.
8.0|#|A nice handy little camera with plenty of features. A good image processor gives excellent quality images.|#|The on off process of twisting the lens and pulling it out with the ends of your fingers is a bit fiddly.
8.0|#|Like it so far, but haven't really used it enough yet to review it properly.|#|
10.0|#|Wide range of proper functions.|#|Could do with an on/off button.

8.0|#|Great photos in day light|#|I've still not read the manual to work out how to make the best use of its features.
1.0|#||#|Common problem with XF-1 is 'Lens Control Error' Fuji should have recalled this product! Sent for repair after a month of light use!
7.0|#|Very good picture quality, with great colours. The lens/sensor is very good quality, yet to find a better camera at the price range of one forty. The retro styling is also very nice.|#|A needless awkwardness to turn on the camera, twist and pull lens. Easy to drop camera as no rubber or raised area/grip to hold. Battery life is ordinary at best. Flash is also in an awkward place.
10.0|#|Looks stunning with great photo capability.|#|None
9.0|#|The camera is small and has a very nice lense and sensor. It takes photos which would be expected from cameras twice it's  price and nowhere near as compact!|#|Only has 4x's optical zoom, which can be annoying at times.
9.0|#|I would recommend the Fuji leather case - it's pretty expensive but is great quality and compliments the camera.|#|I have yet to find anything I don't like or am disappointed with.
10.0|#|Big aperture available, so focussed subject with blurred background is easy.|#|
8.0|#|Easy to use.|#|
10.0|#|It's small compact and very easy to use. For anybody worrying about the off on function it's so simple.|#|None really
9.0|#|The automatic scene detection is very impressive too. Absolute bargain.  Many positive comments have been made about it's looks.|#|No wireless.
7.0|#|The image quality is almost as good as my DSLR. It looks great!|#|The only bad points are it is fiddly to turn on (esecially after a few drinks) and a better zoom would be beneficial but I knew that the zoom was not huge when I purchased the camera so cannot really complain.
8.0|#|The camera is easy to use and has a lot of nice features.  The different settings that you can use for the lens are really useful.|#|You have to keep popping up the flash.
8.0|#|great lens especially like the lo stop for night photos|#|bit tricky using the menus after Nikon for years!
9.0|#|It performs well and has an impressive build quality|#|Nothing worth mentioning
8.0|#|Good range of features and built-in filters.|#|I found having to twist the lens to turn the camera on and off a little strange at first, but am now used to it.
10.0|#|Great little camera, looks fantastically retro and takes a very good photo.|#|
5.0|#||#|battery finishes very fast
8.0|#|At current price, a bargain.  Fully-specced camera, sensor larger than most compacts so image quality very decent.  Highly portable.  Huge range of functions.  Turn-on via lens throat is intuitive.  Capable of superb pictures.|#|Not for point-and-shoot people. Some may find switch-on not to their liking. Not the smallest of compacts but can still go in a pocket.

10.0|#|Just love it!|#|Switch on and focus takes some getting used to but I like it
8.0|#|Fantastic image quality and the ability to shoot in RAW with a camera at this price is great. The EXR auto setting is also very good.|#|Some of the menus aren't particularly easy to navigate, but that's a minor point.
10.0|#|Amazing price. Best point and shoot camera and a bargain at this price. Fuji colors are amazing and jpegs produced are similar to the results of my X100. Full manual controls. Photo enthusiasts will love this. Especially if you are a Fuji fan.|#|Manual on/off isn't for everyone. You will love it or hate it.

1.0|#|Really nice camera, good sensor and manual lense|#|such a shame , within 2 weeks the lens failed! from reading around its a common fault, lucky for me it was within the month so took it back for a full refund, guess things are cheap and discounted for a reason !
9.0|#|Bought this camera because it has good image quality, even at low light and so far this has worked very well.  I have still a lot to learn about photography and feel this camera offers the opportunity to experiment with manual settings and is value for money. The camera is well build and easy to hold.|#|I have not enough technical knowledge or own other cameras to compare this camera to other brands.  I hope that Fuji will update this camera with GPS and Wifi without compromising the image quality.
10.0|#|just so much fun|#|Bit fidely
9.0|#|Really retro look and the pictures it takes have been really great quality. My new favourite thing about it is the 'perfect skin' mode - it makes you and your friends look flawless. Bit of a cheat, but every little helps when you're getting wrinkles and a shiny forehead...|#|Also the casing could do to be leather, but that's if I'm being picky
9.0|#|The quirky way of switching it on is not a problem and is easy and quick to get used to. I like the ability to put it in standby mode by a quick turn of the lens. A lovely little retro style camera highly recommended, but do read other reviews as well as everyone has their own preferences. I haven't used the video function.|#|Tip - buy a case as the lens cap is not lockable.
10.0|#|very nice!|#|
8.0|#|Pocket size. Build quality and looks. Natural looking photos. Good price.|#|Can occasionally miss the focus.
9.0|#|Good looks, great lens, fast autofocus, manual zoom ring is awesome|#|Bit weird switching on method, but can get used to it, camera feels bit fragile at times
10.0|#|Lovely camera, looks good as well as takes good pictures and very easy to use.|#|To switch on or off you need to turn the zoom lens - not used to it and expected a button for powering on/off
9.0|#|Very versatile, product easy to use bought as present for 21st birthday|#|

10.0|#|Retro design, small, plenty of direct access buttons, picture iq, nice lcd screen.|#|Zoom could be a bit longer, battery life only average, could really use a viewfinder, even a small viewfinder would suffice.
9.0|#|most features|#|strange way of turning on by turning and pulling lens barrel
10.0|#|This little camera is absolutely stunning. From the way it look, to the way it handle and the excellent image quality. The retro styling sets it part from most compacts on the market. It is also full loaded with features, like full manual setting, the ability to shoot in RAW and the manual zoom lens.|#|The only bad point people might say is the way the camera switches on. You have to twist and pull the lens to switch the camera on, but to be honest after a couple of hour use, this becomes second nature.
8.0|#|Excellent jpeg's , design and compact size.|#|Extended function button seems pointless. Battery goes into freefall as soon as it stops showing 100%.
10.0|#|If you want a pocket cam with DSLR features then buy this!|#|None yet
9.0|#|Great product with a really nice retro look that is still top of the line and easy to use. Sturdy and comfortable in your hand while being small and light enough to be extremely portable.|#|Only bad point would be the case that most sites try to sell with this camera - for that price I would expect real leather! Buy a cheaper alternative (of which there are many).

8.0|#|Bought the camera as was a keen retro film user. This one has so many functions but good access to them.Too many for me as I can do much of the editing on Photoshop. Not yet got the hang of the dial and the screen menus. Fiddly opening  they all say that but easy enough. Liked the manual zooming it must save some power. Amazed at the 3 inch close focussing and the depth of focus in closeups. Astonished to see excellent colours in a nearly dark unlit  interior of my office (I could hardly see the end of the room) Love the wide angle but have not yet worked out how  to do a opanorama and the instruction booklet does not seem to help..|#|
2.0|#|its a nice looking small camera|#|I didn't even take a picture with this camera, when I realised how you to start the camera by twisting the lens ring in a weird way, plus the lens itself seems very flimsy and poorly designed.

9.0|#|The X-T10 takes all of the excellent elements of the X-T1 and puts them in a smaller easier to use body. The autofocus is fast and generally accurate (apart from in very low light). For the traveller, the X-T10 is an excellent choice, especially when paired with the 18-55 2.8-4.0 mm zoom (which is an outstanding optic for a kit lens). I recently took this on a trip to Europe and hardly noticed the weight carrying it around in a shoulder bag. Unlike some other manufacturers, Fuji have kept faith with the same battery across the range and they also provide excellent firmware updates.|#|In an ideal world, the weather sealing would have been carried over from the X-T1 and this  would have reinforced its value as an ideal travel camera.  The optional grip is useful as it makes the camera easier to handle when using longer lenses.
10.0|#|The image quality from the X-Trans APSC sensor is second to none and with the X-T10 you get a magnesium body in a small size that makes it easier to carry around... It really is the DSLR replacement for me as It beats out my Nikon D5100 in every catagory.|#|no bad points what so ever... Superb build wrapped around the best APSC sensor in the world right now for £600?... Yeah absolutely no bad points here.

8.0|#|Top quality build and excellent features|#|over priced for what you get
10.0|#|Build quality, camera feel, and picture quality in the same league as DSLRs that cost 3 - 4 times as much. Apart from not being able to change lenses it does everything that a high end DSLR can but in a compact format.|#|Apart from that it's the perfect camera for serious amateurs and professionals not wanting to lug around a shed load of camera equipment all the time. You won't be disappointed!

7.0|#|Looks good. You can turn the flash off. Has multiple modes for more control over the results. Fun.|#|Prints are too small. Poor results with low lighting indoors. Expensive. Viewfinder framing is inaccurate.
9.0|#|Old Skool Dials! Retro Interface. Without these it wouldn't be fun to use. Would  recommend it as a travel camera!|#|Multi Area focusing, it cannot find something to focus on, it goes back n forth. I maybe wrong it might be because of the lens but I doubt a 35mm 1.4 can be out of  focus.
10.0|#|loads of customisation. Fuji are a great company. Onboard raw processing is very handy when learning what the various processing parameters do. Great fun to use.|#|Be prepared for some quality control issues on early models, though Fuji will fix any problems very quickly.
10.0|#|Purchased it for the skin tones for portraiture  -  did not disappoint 10 out of 10 !|#|Not so far.
10.0|#|Weight, quality, lens range|#|None
9.0|#|small size, large viewfinder, wireless remote control, manual controls|#|nothing that I definitely don't like ,  just things I need to get used too, coming from the DSLR world. Oh, yes! I hate the short battery life, but I will learn to live with it as the camera is amazing. So, I will switch from Nikon D810 and X-T1 and have the very best of both worlds! I will update this later if possible
9.0|#|Size is great, like going back to my first film SLR so is much more discreet in use on the street. Flip screen is great fro getting low and framing a shot. Image quality, build and lenses are awesome. Yes, it's expensive but it really is a match for a semi-pro DSLR|#|Buttons not the easiest to get used to coming from a DSLR background, a bit small and fiddly on the back. Lots going on in the menus - maybe too much.
8.0|#|Image is good!|#|the design is not good !the camera lens do not have any cover,that would lead to lens easliy be damaged!And,it is not easy to charge!every time,I need to open the battery place and then charge!
10.0|#|kids used all time and with Wi-Fi the pictures were on Facebook every night sharing with friends across the world. it is very robust and has fell out of rucksack and bounced on pool side. Not even a scratch on it..  great quality and would recommend to anyone..|#|none.
9.0|#|Robust, easy to follow programming, several shooting modes. good video capability with 'quick start' button.|#|Location of lens means that you get several shots of your finger if not very careful. Fiddly battery charge/download port.

9.0|#|Robust, easy to use|#|
8.0|#|Lovely camera good quality pictures, hd video superb quality|#|Doesn't need such a big button on the side. Don't think you could ever use the video mode with self focus far to much noise!
10.0|#|Really good package for the enthusiast on a low budget. Great range of features to allow growth as a photographer. Auto/point and shoot gives really good results in all the conditions I've encountered so far. Love it.|#|I can't really think of any.
8.0|#|Beautiful rendition of colour. Sharp definition on focusing. My best camera out of nine cameras!.|#|None yet!
9.0|#|She's very happy with it so far and is finding it a breeze to use. I've had a play with it too, really like it a lot. The manual zoon lens gives it the feel of an SLR. Picture quality is great. We took a bunch of snaps over Eid and looking at them on my PC I'm very happy with the quality.|#|No touchscreen.
10.0|#|Easy to use, I worked out most of it without the manual. Feels sturdy and well built. Good battery life. Some good fun new features.|#|Missing one or two of the features I had on the hs10, but it has a few new ones to compensate.
9.0|#|Automatic functions perfect to provide beginner with excellent results with manual functions to satisfy the needs of the experienced photographer.|#|None.
10.0|#|Best viewfinder of a super zoom camera, manual focus ring, excellent macro photos, twist barrel zoom which gives more accuracythan an electronic zoom, fastest autofocus of any bridge camera. This is the best super zoom available for photographing birds/wildlife.|#|Really can't think of any, it out performs it's peers in almost every way. If you need slightly better picture quality throughout the zoom range, go for the Panasonic fz200, and there are some 60x zoom cameras available, but this is the best all rounder.

9.0|#|Easy to use, and quick to pick up|#|Not as convenient as an SLR when taking quick successive shots which are from slightly different angles, although the multiple shot function is still very good, but tricky to master.
3.0|#|Ease of use|#|Not sure if it is genuine Fuji
5.0|#|The viewfinder in the rear which turns at all angles|#|The viewfinder in the rear which has stopped working after 26 months with a 12 month guarantee
10.0|#|Exceptional build and image quality. HD video is excellent.|#|The supplied manual is too brief for a camera of this quality and price. A full owner's manual should be included to enable the user to gain a detailed understanding of what is an excellent camera.

10.0|#|I brought this camera for my dads 70th, i wanted a camera that was easy for him to use but wasn't plasticy and cheap looking.  This camera not only looks good but works really well and is good value for money.  Being the non-technical person that he is, my dad was really pleased with this camera and is having no problem using it. It is very straightforward to use, i'm so pleased that after doing alot of research and looking at other cameras in this price range that I kept coming back to this one and finally decided on this stylish easy to use camera.|#|That the camera uses double AA batteries rather than a battery that you can charge and it doesn't come with a SD card or camera case these have to be purchased seperately.

10.0|#|When I opened box I discovered Fuji had substituted AV10 for the 150 which has 14 megapixels.  Even better.  Camera is very light and easy to carry.  Very easy to operate just point and camera does the rest.  Excellent value for money.|#|Only bad point is the instructions are contained on a DVD disc which means having to look at the instructions on a computer.  Not good if buyer doesn't have a computer.  Fuji should have provided a short succinct instruction booklet.

Definitely buy this camera.|#|A rechargeable battery would have been good.  It takes 2 AA batteries which could be eaten up depending on how often you use it.

1.0|#|takes AA batteries that can be bought anywhere and I always keep plenty of spare rechargeables. easy to use|#|total lack of any control, made so idiot proof that it stops you making your picture better. the panoramic function is a load of rubbish and actually makes the photos smaller when stitched so just a waste of time, you might as well take one shot and letter box or better take the individual shots and then stitch them on a pc. Far too many scene selection options. Poor response when connected to the PC with the cable. needs to have batteries in and be turned on to be connected to PC - duh ? what the hell for a waste of battery ! software supplied is the usual marketing rubbish that hides your photos away never to be found again.

9.0|#|Good quality sturdy camera, great for first time camera users! Great picture quality, bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. Does not feel light and flimsy and really easy to use.|#|My only complaint would be that the shutter does not close, so if you have the camera out of the case the lense is always open.
10.0|#|Easy to use and comes with batteries so can get started.|#|although it is easy to use and get started it has no memory and as I did not realise my brother was unable to use his christmas present ( I thought they all came with a Little memory) was not sue where to mark it down for this it is the only issue we have found so far.

10.0|#|Bought this camera for my elderly Mother-in-Law to replace a camera which came out of the ark! She needed to capture some special pictures at a family event that would never happen again. Bearing in mind she doesn't do technology at all and gets easily flustered this little camera was the perfect choice as it does everything for the user without them having to mess about with settings. Following a ten minute lesson (which I repeated several times, but she did eventually remember what I had said) and lots of encouragement she got over her fear of using the camera and took some lovely pictures.|#|Didn't find any!

8.0|#|superb, easy to use, brilliant results|#|none
10.0|#|Ease of Use|#|Slow to get a focus, can miss action shots in particular
10.0|#|Its a great alternative to an slr especially as its light weight and you dont need to change lenses.|#|The main disadvantage is that you do not get the depth of field as with an slr and the smallest aperture size you can go to is f9 which compared to an slr (eg f22) is not great.

10.0|#|The 10X optical zoom is superb.  It looks good and performs excellently. Can take up to 400 shots between battery charges.|#|
9.0|#|This camera can be used by both experienced photographers and amateurs alike. The picture quality is outstanding and the 10X optical zoom gives it the edge above all other cameras in its class|#|Nothing major perhaps a little light but and the user manual could be a little more friendly toward the novice cameraman like myself.
9.0|#|Shutter lag is very good when pre-focussed. Batteries last very well, especially if viewfinder used rather than LCD. Fits your hand. Fast transfer of pictures to PC even via USB1 - no doubt due to memory card being XD. Completely reliable mechanically. 10x optical zoom is very useful and still rare in this camera's class.|#|S5500 has very few bad points! The following are some very minor criticisms: It would be useful if the viewfinder tilted upwards. Adapter ring needs to be removed for macro shots. Too few frames per second for AVI filming.
9.0|#|An excellent camera at this price. Has a good range of control functions, both automatic and manual. The 10x zoom has proved extremely useful.|#|Lack of a separate flash socket and the manual focus is a bit weak.
9.0|#|shoot for relative beginners, but it produces high quality pics that make you feel like a seasoned pro! Flick over to manual settings at will, and you can fiddle with settings as much as you like. Great!|#|None, really. No complaints at all.
10.0|#|Light weight and easy to use|#|Not 100% clear viewfinder image, but does not effect image quality

9.0|#|New to digital,does all that I expected|#|Main dial sometimes gets moved by accident,so check before you press
10.0|#|The 10x optical zoom ensures fine picture quality and 'candid' protraits|#|The function control knob can be easily rotated by accident so requires checking prior to shooting
10.0|#|The ability to use AA batteries and a great zoom lens.|#|
7.0|#|ease of use,you can leave it on auto or play around with the settings. good optical magnification.menus seem reasonably easy to follow.picture quality is good for price of camera|#|scene mode switch hard to see in the dark, time lag between pressing the button and actual capture of the picture although better than a lot of other similiar priced cameras is still slow. focusing in the dark on auto is not the good causing hazy pictures.
10.0|#|Very good camera with great features and photos|#|Very hungry on batteries will need rechargable batteries
10.0|#|light for travelling.  Lots of features.|#|Uses ordinary batteries within a few days of use.

9.0|#|The fujifilm S5500 is easy to use and the images i have produced are to a high qulaity|#|
9.0|#|Basically you are given an slr featured camera that does not have inter-changable lenses.. however you can add wide-angle, macro and telephoto lenses.|#|Supplied memory card is laughably small, however upgrades are cheap
9.0|#|An easy to handle camera. The image quality is extremely good for a 4MP camera, and, of course, the 10x optical zoom is a great extra.|#|The LCD display could be better.
9.0|#|fantastic value|#|hard to fault
9.0|#|An easy to use camera,for beginner to pro.|#|Small LCD
9.0|#|A well built camera with fantastic picture quality. The main plus point is the powerful zoom which is normally not available on non SLR cameras.|#|It has taken us ages to figure out how all of the (many) features work on the camera. We are ,however, digital camera virgins so to speak!
9.0|#|Easy to use straight from the box even if you know little about camera's. Surprising results from a reasonably priced camera.|#|Would like to have more flash options i.e. fill in flash for automatic photo modes.
8.0|#|The rubber armoured body feels quality and the 10X zoom lens is impressive.|#|Only one slight downside is no image stabilizer, though not a problem long focal lengths if you have a tripod.
9.0|#|nice and light, good features for the enthusiast|#|with a filter fitted eg. UV, you can't use the lens cap.
9.0|#|can give excellent picture quality results with minimal effort.|#|No case available for this particular camera which would have been a nice extra.

9.0|#|light weight easy to use ideal for our 1st digital camera|#|none
9.0|#|Excellent optical zoom facility (which was my main reason for buying this camera); good flash (much better than compact camera); good video; long battery life; uses XD memory cards; lots of features.|#|4mpx is adequate, though one might have expected higher resolution given the other features of this camera; LCD display slightly disappointing, though I now prefer monitoring through the viewfinder, which is good; I've found the menus not very memorable, so I have to look at the manual if I'm doing anything slightly unusual; rather heavy and chunky - can't be carried on a belt (but then you get a better lens that way); zoom a bit wobbly (thought it was a fault, but it's the same on other S5500s and seems to be a feature of the build).
8.0|#|This camera was the perfect step up from my old point and shoot digital, incorporating a wide range of manual features whilst also being accessible to the amateur user. Image quality is excellent for the price.|#|Can't match the performance of DSLR
9.0|#|Very compact|#|Doesn't like being switched on with lens cap still on - a bit picky but it is annoying sometimes
9.0|#|Great all round camera with good results on most settings with very little hassle. The 10x optical zoom is fantastic|#|Viewfinder can be difficult to use and not very clear. Shutter delay can mean you lose those surprise shots with animals and kids.
10.0|#|video are both top notch.|#|Didn;t like the look of the camer when the lens was out.  Put the adaptor ring on though and it looks just like an SLR!
10.0|#|very light|#|camera could have done to have been supplied with a better memory card
9.0|#|Just about everything. I like the Finepix brand anyway but this allows some manual refinements to settings instead of just the auto setting. It takes a good picture as well.|#|None I can think of.
8.0|#|Compact and light, but solidly built, the S5500 has pretty much all of the features needed to take a point-and-shoot photographer to the next level of pictures.|#|The only weak point is the continous shooting modes, which along with the autofocus ideally should be quite a bit faster. If you are particularly interested in motion photography, look elsewhere...
10.0|#|Robust for handeling|#|
8.0|#|Picture quality is excellent and I enjoy using the closeup feature for plants and flowers and the zoom for birds|#|The cover over the socket for down loading seems flimsy though I have not yet had any problems with it
10.0|#|standard AA batteries.Excellent battery charger and batteries were part of deal.|#|No real bad points, fuji computer software not as good as (Canon easyphoto). Camera a bit bulky.
10.0|#|I have found this camera easy to use. Images are good particularly when taking birds and animals at a distance.|#|Can have  camera shake on occassions. Tripod is needed for portrait shots.
9.0|#|The video is better than expected.|#|The camera turns of to conserve power, but the re-boot takes several seconds in which time you miss opportunities (the power off feature can be overridden).
9.0|#|I continually take brilliat pics and after 6 months I still haven't read the manual. I guess there;s still some potential here.|#|As with all digis it takes a bit of time to auto focus and to get use to the delay between click and take.
10.0|#|This camera is easy to use and although a bit bigger than some digital cameras it sits nicely in the hand.it is feature packed and set to auto any body could use it. with the the adapter ring that comes with the camera you can also add wide angle and telephoto conversion lenses but it also gives you the ability to use filters (cokin type)which opens up another dimension to your photography.|#|this is not a bad point but the camera setting dial sometimes moves when getting the camera out of its case so you need to check your settings befor using it but this is minor
9.0|#|good pictures, not difficult to use|#|it times out after a while if you do not take a picture and you have to switch the camera off then onn

Overall delighted with product and would definitely recommend.|#|None

8.0|#|Overall I'm very pleased with the Z800. Nice design. Good quality pictures when using EXR modes. Easy to use with a large display and touch screen interface. Some good features and manual settings (e.g. exposure/ISO). Folded lens inside camera body provides optical zoom. Good value for money.|#|Auto mode is a bit limited, you have to use EXR modes and manual settings for the best picture quality. I'd like more control of some of the settings.

Good deal from Dixons with free case and 4GB memory card.|#|It would have been nice to have full instructions rather than on a CD but apart from that the only one I've found is navigating the menu's but that may be because I haven't had the camera very long.

9.0|#|Quality photos and zoom means we can take close photos.|#|None at present.
10.0|#|Very easy to use, once again Fuji have made their cameras with joe public in mind. It's a very good point and shoot with some great features for those who want to experiment a bit more.|#|The LCD screen is a little noisy - the pictures on the card are really crisp as you'd expect. It's just sad the LCD doesn't quite do the pictures justice.
9.0|#|First digital camera I've bought in a long time but soon got the hang of it.  This camera makes it very easy to take good pics without having to resort to endless pages of a manual.  Certainly a winner for someone with moderate skills - like me!|#|Haven't found any yet.
10.0|#|I already have a Fugi Finepix Z1 and found this camera's functions quite similar in use.  I've hardly referred to the instructions because it's user friendly and there are a few nice upgrades to the software too. With 10 x zoom I was able to achieve good photos of my Grandson at a recent school fun day, from quite a distance and was pleased with results.  I've taken quite a few macro shots and have been very happy with the results.  Indoor shots have proved to be very good too.  I can't wait to use my tripod with this camera and just wish I'd bought it earlier on in the year, but it would probably have been much dearer!  Achieved passport photos with ease.|#|Can't think of any right now.
9.0|#|I was worried that the camera would be very heavy to carry round but it was surprisingly light. The on screen display is very clear. Overall a great camera so far.|#|The only bad point so far is that it uses AA batteries rather than a rechargeable one.
9.0|#|Quite easy to use when you read the book that comes with it. Has a number of features including a function which enables you to take continuous photos. It will also take 2 shots, one after the other-one with the flash and one straight after without flash which is very useful. At least 4 people have already purchased one of these models after seeing mine so I think it is very good value for money.|#|A bit awkward to hold if you have snall hands and it does not fit in your pocket so you have to carry a bag for it.

10.0|#|Good value for people who, like me, have perhaps had a similar film camera. I soon cottoned on to the similarities and used what I knew before to help me. All the menus that allow you to choose what ever setup you like. A view finder is essential, especially in bright conditions.|#|I have got a bad habit when holding the camera in my left hand of putting my finger over the flash housing so preventing it from popping up. I am schooling myself not to do this. Would have been nice if a protective case was included in the package. When doing strenuous walks, condensation forms on the viewing screen in cold weather, the camera was inside my jacket in this instance.

This has become the benchmark for what I'm looking for in a camera.  My brother-in-law bought one a week later.  Only 8MP, but the 10MP doesn't have zoom in video mode, so am glad I opted for this one.|#|

Anti-Shake and Red Eye are fantastic for catching great photos that dont need editing... The neck strap is very comfortable and has a wide padded bit for the back of your neck - close ups are a dream to take.  An absolute pleasure to use and play with.|#|Battery compartment cover is flimsy and not of same build as rest of camera and the lens cap is a waste of time - it needs to be alot better.

8.0|#|My first venture in SLR type cameras. Excellent image quality even at full telephoto. Image stability works very well visible cutting out hand shake at the extreme extension of the telephoto lens. Good control of the exposure if required but full automatic still there when you feel lazy! Feels well made and all controls come easily to hand - good ergonomic design. For a first camera of the SLR type but without the expense of seperates (body and lenses) the S8000 is an excellent choice combining all you need in one compact unit.|#|with the camera a lot which might account for it. Will be putting in rechargeables next time.
9.0|#|Large lcd monitor  and when selecting your shooting options they are displayed in large format on the monitor. The zoom is fantastic for those wildlife shots and the location of the zoom button is far better on this and easier to operate than on the s5600 .The Macro is also very good for those insect and butterfly shots .Nice and light .Gives you the choice of setting up the camera  to suit yourself using aperture or shutter  priority but is also very easy for the complete novices amongst us by using auto it then becomes a point and shoot . The built in Memory is also a handy feature for those times when your card is full all in all a pretty good alrounder|#|Takes a little time from turning on to being ready to take pictures having previously owned the s5600 which was a lot faster . would reccomend using rechargable batteries and always have a spare set fully charged .
8.0|#|Excellent zoom, great quality photos|#|Lens cap falls off all the time, you can't zoom in and out in video mode
9.0|#|My son has produced some brilliant photos of birds, butterflies and small animals using the optical zoom, and has found the camera easy to use.|#|Difficult to find a suitable camera bag at a reasonable price, because of the unwieldy shape of the camera.
10.0|#|Extremely easy to use.  Picture quality is excellent, I particularly like the quality of picture when using natural daylight mode.  Very easy to transfer photos to PC.  I'm a keen photographer and in the past have used SLRs, this camera far out performs them.  There is a shooting mode for almost every occasion.  Overall opinion is this is an exceptional camera for the price I paid, worth every penny.|#|I don't think there is any real bad points.  The only small criticism is that I also purchased the accessories pack and I have found that the case supplied is a little bit of a tight fit, no room for extra batteries.  This however is more of an inconvience rather than a bad point.
10.0|#|Picture Qaulity is not compromised by the technology as with the more recent models. Good navigation features make this camera an excellent piece of kit for the amateur. Quality of pictures is great and the zoom holds the detail well.|#|Needs 4 AA batteries which last for over 100 pics with flash but recommend re-chargable AA batteries to save money.
9.0|#|Ease of use in various conditions and the superb quality of the pictures, even when using the macro to photograph flowers.  Very good flash operation.|#|Only one minor irritation is the battery compartment lock
9.0|#|I've found this to be a really easy to use camera which has some great features and has produced some excellent photographs. The continouse shooting option is great for cricket and golf action!|#|
9.0|#|The feel of the camera in the hand.  Its ease of use and the quality of the pictures.  The camera was chosen mainly because of its optical zoom, which is excellent and with camera shake reduction feature ensures good close up pictures|#|Hardly worth mentioning, but opening the battery compartment is fiddily
8.0|#|Ability to have manual control of just about all the functions|#|The loss of picture quality at extreme magnification.
10.0|#|Ranges from wide angle to 18x Zoom - just used on holiday with many different requirements from scenic to low light. Zoom was excellent and an improvement on my previous 10x zoom. Camera shake reduction helps with long zoom. Natural light selection produced excellent results in dark rooms, and the ability to take 2 photos (one with flash one without) was very useful. Scene menu choices were also very easy to use, especially landscape which I used a lot. It made taking photos in all conditions so easy without having to think too much.|#|Have not found any yet.
9.0|#|The stabalisation system works very well.|#|Sliding door on card slot a bit delicate.
9.0|#|The auto setting has many good features which allow you to just zoom in and let the auto focus take away much of the work. As a novice user, I have found myself using the guides that came with the software and hints and tips which is just a link on the internet you have to sign up for. Still very good advice on that. I do like the battery drain feature which helps to maintain battery life for rechargeable batteries to complete their cycle rather than recharge when they simply get low. The weight of the camera is easy to live with and fits in my pocket, but I would feel comfortable putting it in some designed storage to protect it|#|No colour temperature manual settings. Not sure if the camera can take general abuse that life has to throw at it. The strap loops I'm not to sure how they will hold out, but they do well for standard use. Could do with more accessories such as a bag to hold it in to carry around. The digital zoom feature isn't great, as they aren't on any camera. The 18x optical zoom is really all that is needed, I just disable digital zoom.

9.0|#|Everything about it, from comfort to hold, to ease of use, has all the normal features, takes excelent photo's even in low light without need for the flash, you can take super macro's for very fine details, and it has 18 time optical zoom not digital so that close up has real quality, I used 4GB memory card that gives me over 1000 pictures at highest quality at 8million Pixels, Just the best camera I have ever owned all you would need unless your a proffesional but at a price 1/2 of the retail|#|saying that it had excellent list, found i could use extended SD so 4GB for less than cost of 1GB of XD

9.0|#|I already own anS3000 which I have been very pleased with but with its greater optical zoom range and additional features the fps8000 is even better.  I am only really a holiday photographer so probably will not use all the features offered but for the most part will just let the Auto function do its job.  I like the idea though of having the choice whether to use flash or not.|#|The camera does everything I need it to.  Perhaps a more avid photographer would be critical of certain features or the lack thereof.
9.0|#|Simple to use as point and shoot but additional features take it into the SLR range. Superb zoom accompanied by a great wide angle facility.|#|Probably just a bit dear relative to the next lower fuji model.

As an avid ebayer of course the best feature is auction mode.  Overall a good camera with excellent picture apart from in the mode I need it most for.|#|I bought this camera for taking indoor sports pictures, namely ice hockey.  I have taken photographs with the zoom extended to its maximum optical zoom and most of the pictures have come out looking like they are in the first phase of using the digital zoom.  I have tried various settings including the sports mode and manual but this doesn't seem to make any difference in the quality.

10.0|#|I have only had the camera a short while but i found it so easy to use, it gives perfect results and there is no comparison to other digital cameras that i have had previously.

Another point to mention is that i contribute to the Which magazine, and it gives it a really good report in this month's issue.|#|I have not found any yet.

7.0|#|whilst the camera is very basic, it has plenty of great features for one in this price range. For starters the X18 optical zoom is very good upto about 3/4 of its length then gets a bit dodgy. But if you are not overly concerned with absolute clarity at maximum zoom then you are onto a winner. The overall size of the camera make it very easy and convenient to carry around, this helps to make it a definate winner in my book.|#|It would work much better if there was an option to zoom in or out in Movie mode, but nonetheless still works very well and picks up the sound well. It takes a little longer to fire up than i would like, and the batteries do not last as long as the makers claim they should (but not too bad)

9.0|#|Lots of great features allow for very flexible photography, for those who don't want the complexity of an SLR and all the other lenses and stuff.|#|Takes a bit of time to get use of all features and navigate through the menu.
9.0|#|Easy to use, nice comfortable feel to the camera, plenty of features to get to grips with, excellent zoom, I think it's good for the amateur as it you can take really good photo's easily and you can practice with all the other advanced settings to achieve optimum picture quality. Able to take excellent Macro photos with so much detail.. Excellent value for money..|#|None that I can think of, only my inexperience with cameras in general
9.0|#|fantastic clear pictures great zoom takes good pictures in all types of light gas loads of features probably too advanced for a novice like me value for money|#|got lost in some of the photo taking modes and the manual has loads of information but you find yourself flicking from page to page loads to learn
9.0|#|It is so easy to use  good grip optional viewfinder perfect for sunny days and using a tripod. The 18x optical zoom is perfect for wildlife shots. it is an excellent option to an SLR if, like me ,they scare you a little!!|#|Would prefer an LI battery
10.0|#|I have found this camera to be very easy to use and to follow the instructions for use, the picture quality is good and I especially like the macro and super macro. The 18x optical zoom is a bonus.|#|Yet to be considered
9.0|#|brilliant optical zoom|#|
9.0|#|picture quality really good|#|none so far
10.0|#|1. General appearance  2. Comfortable to hold and use. 3. Looks like a camera! I used to work with a 35mm camera similar in looks. 4. Has a good solid feel about it.|#|2. I am finding it difficult to get on with the computer element - to download new pictures, and am using the Zoom Browser I had loaded when I had my previous Canon. This accepts the pictures from the S8000fd quite readily, but I would prefer to have a separate unit to operate the FinePix model. It is easy to print with my new Epson printer which the Zoom Browser sends instructions to as if it had always done so!
10.0|#|this camera is so simple to use and all the new features are great loving the face recognition feature|#|that it uses battaries very quickly would be better if it came with a lithuaim battery that would be better
10.0|#|Fast shoot speed, fab zoom simple to use, Must have features are facial recognition and anti-shutter|#|Flash options are a bit difficult, just us anto and red eye though...
10.0|#|Cannot fault the camera. Every aspect is fantastic|#|Pity about the case. I would have thought that the case would have been better, i.e. having the type of case that just pops open and stays on the camera strap. The leather case supplied is as about as pratical as a chocolate fireguard!
10.0|#|Ps also must mention the fact that it takes different types of storage media is also a bonus, it meant that I didn't have to spend more money buying another type of memory card.|#|None so far
8.0|#|Good value for money|#|manual pop-up flash
9.0|#|Mechanical controls and system menus are easy to use. Compact but comfortable design. Great LCD screen. Powered by AA batteries which you can find everywhere. SD and SDHC media are cheap and plentiful.|#|Lack of RAW format. The lens cover feels flimsy. Data transfer to PC via USB is a bit slow - it is quicker to remove the data card and put it in a USB2.0 card reader.
9.0|#|Lighter than a DSLR and the results are excellent. results from the full out lens so far in daylight compare favourably with my DSLR.|#|Some areas are 'plasticy' ie flexy and could fit better. I would like to see a body mounting screw thread to enable the fitment of lens adaptors like  a hood and filters.
9.0|#|Good for the average user. A very good zoom lens|#|

9.0|#|18x optical zoom, 15 frames per second and dual picture stabilisation.|#|
9.0|#|easy use, not to small a camera (i hate small cameras)|#|none
8.0|#||#|When you have face detection on and trying to take non people pictures in auto mode focus is centre of the frame, it doesn't compensate to get best focus across the frame.
9.0|#|Very good quality pictures but you need to remember to turn on the image stabaliser function.|#|
9.0|#|easy to use. v good value for money. ideal for the next step up in photography|#|Doesn't come with recgarble battery or chrager. Its still a bit big.
9.0|#|Excellent Zoom, Great Picture quality, Amazing Price.|#|None as per the Price...
8.0|#|I am very pleased with this camera so far, it seems to be very very good value for money. I have only had it about three weeks so early days. It seems very easy to use when on auto and I have taken good clear pictures under differing conditions. I am looking forward to experimenting with it when the better weather arrives and I can get outside more.|#|I have not found any bad points yet.
10.0|#|10/10|#|thats it
9.0|#|Great picture quality and easy use of features without having to read the whole manual.. The 18X zoom is awesome and the sole reason why I bought the camera... Close up pictures are brilliant!|#|Other than that the good points outweigh the bad and the camera overall is excellent!!!!
10.0|#|the many features.|#|
8.0|#|camera. Tons of features, I have a lot to learn about shooting in the varied manual modes.|#|Could do with being Lithium Ion friendly, as the NiMh AA's don't last very long when shooting lots of pictures.

10.0|#|This is my third Fuji camera and I love them.|#|riticism does not amount to anything of real importance.
9.0|#|very easy to use, good zoom|#|should come with a memory card
9.0|#|This is a viable alternative to a digital SLR if you want to save on money and bulk.|#|The image quality is not perfect, i.e. there is barrel distortion on wide angle and chromatic aberration on some edges but at the price you can't complain.
9.0|#|I am used to an SLR style camera so I like the look and feel of the S800fd. There are a number of very useful features, including the twin image stabilizing systems and multiple-shot facility. I find the image quality perfectly acceptable for the kind of photographs I take - obviously a professional photographer would need something more, but for the amateur it is more than adequate.|#|The plastic body is a bit creaky and seems less robust than the SLRs I have used in the past - otherwise no negative issues.
10.0|#|Zoom|#|Size
9.0|#|Easy to use - very high quality for such a small price.  Auto mode is fantastic.  Colours came out perfect on a very dull day.|#|None
9.0|#|Ease of use of menu|#|Grainy images on high ISO
8.0|#|Zoom feature is good, being able to choose between the LCD monitor and the viewfinder in bright sunlight means more accurate pictures|#|Dodgy lens cover, too flimsy, too loose
8.0|#|Picture quality is great and zoom does not affect quality so making close-ups from a picture works well for my applications.|#|I find that the face recognition feature and shake feature are in an awkward place when I am using the camera as I keep touching them when I am holding the camera taking shots (bearing in mind that I usually hold the camera one handed as I have other things in my hands as well, as I use it mostly when working)
10.0|#|Excellent value, great pictures|#|Battery life
8.0|#|High power zoom gives great flexibility.  Normal snaps have excellent vibrant colours.  Macro/super macro very impressive.  Not as flexible as full digital SLR, but fantastic value for money.|#|When using zoom at full extent, the depth of field in focus is very shallow - meaning pictures have to be composed carefully else results are disappointing.  Grainy images in low light conditions.

Ive heard that the s8000 doesnt actually have the same lens as its predessors which was an award winning one. Maybe thats the reason or maybe i havent got to grips with it properly yet....only had it a couple of weeks.

I like the way the extending lens will push off the lens cap when the camera is turned on.|#|Doesn't come with a case. I wonder how long it will keep working for, because the price seems so low for such a high quality product.
10.0|#|Being a big fan of Fuji cameras i can't see a single fault in this camera. It has everything i want/need. The extra optical zoom took a little bit of getting used to, for ease of use i can't rate it highly enough and the images taken are of a very high quality.|#|

10.0|#|I love this camera, the pictures are very clear and make you look like a good photographer!  Get a tripod because you can get a bit of camera shake on full zoom but with tripod just excellent also allows you to be in your own pictures with the timer facility . Its really quite easy to use even thought there are lots of preprogramed settings. read the manual and you will be pleased . Its a nice size and great that you dont have to carry lots of lenses. We have two slr cameras but wanted something a bit more simpler and user friendly and this is in my opinion.|#|everything has bad points but so far nothing to complain about
9.0|#|Easy to use with excellent quality photographs.  Zoom is great.  There are so many features we have not had a chance to use them all yet.  It will take time to read the book and remember what buttons to press for the different functions|#|It is not a camera for point and shoot.  The camera has similar properties of an SLR which means it takes a little time to set up the shot, however we are sure that once we have mastered the use of the relevant functions this will improve the quality of the 'instant' photographs we take.  It does take a little time to focus when using the zoom, but we are still learning about the camera so would say we haven't mastered that bit yet.

In everyway all of its features are good and easy to use. Only for having a top end SLR, I would be buying one for myself.|#|Hard on batteries, requires rechargables.
9.0|#|HD output to view on TV screen directly from the camera|#|
9.0|#|Very easy to use and gives a good zoom range and quality.|#|Bought to take pictures of daughter showjumping and can be difficult to judge picture taking timing.  I ofter miss the action as there is a delay from pressing button and picture being taken.
10.0|#|Very versatile, easy to handle. I like the panorama facility and also that I can take black and white photographs as well as colour.|#|none
9.0|#|Great camera easy to use,brilliant zoom, picture quality is first class,connections are great.|#|Unable to use filters no thread, lens cap keeps falling off.
10.0|#|We bought the camera in the sale and feel we got great value for money. If we were not on a budget we would have been tempted to increase our purchase price and buy this camera after reading so many good reports.|#|Absolutely none.
10.0|#|This is a fantastic camera and very easy to use with very clear colour quality on the photographs and excellent Panorama shot features.  I highly recommend this camera and is an excellent upgrade from the previous Fujifilm camera I owned which was only 8MP|#|Lens cap could be improved, but a small bad point for an otherwise superb camera
9.0|#|Great value camera, was bought as a gift for teenager who wants to do photography. She was very happy with it great starter camera.|#|
9.0|#|light weight, view finder definately an advantage, picture quality superb.|#|manual could be more informative, will test all options by trial and error.
8.0|#|Like all the S series it does a lot for the price. Has given some great results already.|#|Lens cap still fits badly. Menu takes to much time to navigate.Blurred shots on full zoom
9.0|#|camera or with knowledge of how to use all of the multitude of features can be used very creatively. It feels good to handle and the controls are well placed.|#|To fully explore and understand all of the camera's features you have to wade through 140 or so A4 pages of the on line manual.
10.0|#|I wanted a better camera as i love taking pictures of anything,even though my friends and family get annoyed with me sometimes.I was very impressed by the quality of my pictures,the zoom is brillant and some of the features are easy to use but like anything else takes practise to get used to.|#|
9.0|#|Great features,  and picture quality|#|Lightweight
8.0|#|lightweight, takes easily available AA batteries so great for travel.|#|Lens cap fall off v easily, like many bridge cameras finding a good size case is not that easy, no full manual included you have to down lead it or make do with basic. Just small grumbles on an otherwise great buy. Easily better than comparable nikons for price.
7.0|#|the camera has a clear screen, you can use the screen or the view finder to take pictures. New camera, so still learning about the various functions of it.|#|would prefer a hard copy full manual ratherthan a cd.
9.0|#|camera is very light and compact so does not take up a lot os space in hand luggage when flying and is easy to use.|#|haven't come across any yet.
10.0|#|supermacro are excellent.|#|Haven't found any yet, although a detailed manual rather than the online version would have been appreciated.  I ended up printing off all 144 pages!!
9.0|#|Better review than the S3400.|#|Dark images can be slightly noisy. Face detection is over sensitive. Thinks anything round is a face so changes to portrait mode.
10.0|#|Quality of the photos are excellent,the smallest detail is picked out in the image. The ease of use is great, and the camera looks good. I'm really impressed with this camera as it was everything I'd hoped for,I was apprehensive buying a new camera,especially buying one with such mixed reviews,however I'm glad I bought this one!|#|The strap is not fantastic,fiddly to put on and doesn't seem to sit verywell. The fact that no case is included is also a bad point as it becomes an extra expense when buying this camera. The only other bad point is the lack of information in the instruction manual,which meant I ended up downloading it from the Internet. However,if these are the only bad things I can find to say about the camera,it's not that bad.
10.0|#|Size of screen and the ability to change between viewing the screen or changing to conventional view finder when taking/composing your picture.|#|It's been said before but the lens cap is not the most secure - only a very minor point though.
10.0|#|Been able to change b/w and colouer like thatauto focus good have yet to try manual settings|#|lens cap comes off easey. manual dosnt cover much you have print off over 160 pages or pay for a full manual
10.0|#|An amazing camera for the money - incredible zoom, really simple to use and reasonably compact. very light if slightly more bulky than a true compact.|#|Tricky to get a case to fit it other than the correct Fujifilm one,
9.0|#|shoot; or manually over-ride most settings. Quality of images produced is amazing! Good clear screen.|#|None of these diminish the pleaseure I have in using the camera!!
9.0|#|It looks good, - not too heavy, most controls are easy to understand, but for me - a bit complicated, but I will get used to them.  The pictures are clear and beautiful.  The panorama control is fantastic - I love it.  This is going to grow into a really good camera.  I would recommend anyone to get one.|#|Having to download the instructions - 160 pages.  How do I hold them together?  The instructon booklet enclosed is just not good enough.  It is possible that I just won't ever get to use some of the controls.  Had to buy a separate case - this was a bit edgy as I wasn't sure how to, but I managed it - eventually.
5.0|#|Compact but too big for a pocket. Nice easy to understand controls. Zoom lens is very good for the size of the camera. Uses AA Batteries and with 2500aH lasted for around 200 shots plus a couple of short videos.|#|for focus all the time making the total recorded video almost unwatchable. I returned this camera and will be purchasing a new Canon again, at much increased cost, but will be worth it.
10.0|#|just used this camera in maldives to take photos of new game fishing project aboard yasawa princess with matt hayes and we found it did everything we asked of it and more..|#|none
8.0|#|excellent value and so happy with my new buy, i only wish that there were more accessories to add on like a pouch, mini tripod, lens cleaner,rechargeable batteries and charger, card reader, you can but these things seperately , but other sites do have the oackage , only that they dont deliver down to malta. I am extremely happy with this buy overall.|#|should come with a pouch, would rather if it wasnt a 4xAA battery use but it's doable
9.0|#|Easy to use but can customize settings to get effects etc. I can't believe that any more Megapixels could make any difference to the finished picture|#|The zoom button sticks sometimes and you have to force it which feels strange, but I am hoping it will ease with use.

9.0|#||#|lens cover is very loose, no point to it at all, falls off most of the time, no camera bag, some same you have to down load the instructions, it has basic information on how to set up but you can pretty much work out how to use it anyway.  If you want to go into detail on how to use have to download instructions on the cd provided.

9.0|#|Very easy to use.  Good all round camera for most people.|#|You do need rechargeable batteries not such a bad point
8.0|#|Price, ease of use and picture quality. I'm not a pro, just like to take decent shots of people and landscapes. Can't fault it on that front.|#|Does feel a bit cheap, but it was. Other than that minor point its really very good.
9.0|#|Excellent zoom, flexible picture control with manual options. Excellent price.|#|Lack of a written detailed manual, the brief one's fine but too basic, so need to consult CD version to discover how to get best out of controls and features as not as intuitive as I'd hoped, but good pictures in point and shoot mode anyway thankfully!

9.0|#|Recently bought this camera as a small alternative to my digital slr.  It's fits handily in a pocket or handbag, very easy to use, managed to work out how to use most functions without referring to the manual (which is on a disk only), it has enough functions for most people who are looking for a camera that mostly does it for you, but you do have some options if you prefer to play around with it a bit.  Photos are excellent. Screen size means photos are very clear and easyto view. Found Dixons to be the cheapest price and arrived really quickly too.|#|Only that the manual is disk only and doesnt come with a case- Managed to pick one up at ur local £1 shop that fits excellently

3.0|#|small and compact|#|Too slow. The time delay between pressing the button to actually taking the photo means that you can't get the image you would want. Spend the extra and get a Canon ixus
9.0|#|Very simple to use with superb picture quality. Compact size and good battery life make this a first class option. The big 3 inch diagonal screen is a good addition and was one of the reason I chose this camera. I have been very satisfied with the results in all of the 'shooting modes',  including 'macro' which is often poor on small compacts. The 'lcd brighten' option goes some way to addressing the dreaded 'bright sunlight reflection' experienced by most digital compacts without a viewfinder.|#|none thus far
9.0|#|Good value for money, Ease of use|#|date can`t be printered on photos
4.0|#|Decent Quality photos|#|There is such a long lag between the flash and the picture actually being taken that the camera is un-useable. The camera boy is also very cheap looking plastic

9.0|#|easy to use, small and light.|#|no case supplied. or charger for use in car.
9.0|#|Build quality is high, especially for the price.  Image quality is very good. Digital zoom useful because of pixel count, and you can crop in from full res in camera and still get a decent result. Can focus well in quite low light without a focus assist lamp. Flash shots give good and even results down to close up. LCD screen is good and large for the price. Distortion in pictures surprisingly low at all focal lengths. Control buttons responsive. Can control ISO and white balance if wanted.  Exposure good and consistent.  All in all a bargain.|#|Noticeable shutter lag even after locking focus - up to second or so. Screen can be poor in bright sun - one click brightener helps, or use menu for this.  LCD screen also does not show full contrast as when shown on computer. but still good when you allow for it.

10.0|#|The price was good and the camera represents a good alternative to an SLR, given the price.  However this is the case for an novice to intermediate photographer.|#|The bad points are that you require alot of batery power so over four day I required 12 AA bateries (under near constant usage).  But rechargables offer great value for money so dont be put off for this reason alone in what is otherwise a fantastic camera.

9.0|#|A really flexible camera; excellent results; point and shoot is great quality, but for those who like to fine tune, or just play around, then it has all the features of a manual SLR.|#|A 16mb card as standard is nothing short of useless; cheaper cameras have larger cards as standard.
9.0|#|Manual zoom rather than motor driven - fast and effective.|#|Ned to attach separate flash by cable rather than hot-shoe - not a major problem.

9.0|#|Good zoom range and high quality 9MP pictures.

10.0|#||#|not found any yet
10.0|#|Awesome camera!  Tonal range (when set to low contrast) is better than film.  Excellent LCD viewfinder and live preview.|#|RAW mode is very slow, but with JPEG this good, who needs it?
9.0|#|Size and handling are easy. Results are most satisfying.|#|None
9.0|#|Very versatile without going to interchangeable lens D SLRs|#|Slow operation in RAW
7.0|#|Many features and the ability to use this cameras manually is an advantage.|#|I am uncertain about the auto focus as I have had one or two out of focus photgraphs.
7.0|#|Range of features, photography modes and lens focus range|#|no facility to reject/save photo once taken like earlier Fuji models. Shutter delay. Smallish screen. Lens quality may be suspect as the few pictures to date do not appear as crisp as one would expect for a 9 Mp camera and not when compared to the 6 Mp S602Z which I also have.
10.0|#|Small enough to fit in your coat pocket but has all the benefits of a S.L.R.but with video as well great camera for quick shots and can be used as a manual camera as well 5 stars all the way|#|can't think of one !
8.0|#|An ideal camera for those wanting a step up from a compact camera but don't want to spend a fortune on  a D-SLR.|#|
1.0|#|Although the camera has many of the features a experienced photographer would like, a person new to photography would also find it easy to use.|#|I would not recommend this model of Fujifilm camera to anyone I liked, but would also like to mention that there are other Fujifilm cameras that perform much better, so it's not the brand its this particular model. Unfortunately there are other brands in this price range that are far superior.
9.0|#|This is a great small digital camera with many qualities of an SLR camera that you can easily carry around, but still with ease of use of a simple compact digital. The large LCD is a bonus and I am surprised at how long the batteries last. Altogether very pleased so far!|#|I haven't found any bad points yet. Just rread the manual well before using as the many settings within a compact camera make some of the manual setting menus a little tricky to use unless you are familiar with it.
8.0|#|Camera looks good feels and handles niecly easy to set up produces good  photographs fair return of pictures per set of batteries|#|len cap ha a habit of dropping off eaily 2GB card supplied wont store pictures taken in high setting or speacial modes due to storage speed of card unit requires at least 4GB card x 40 storage speed
8.0|#|Great camera, packed with features for not alot of money, took 600 shots on the batts that came with the camera and also used them batteries to learn the cameras settings and features! Very impressed!|#|Bit bulky for a lot of users.
7.0|#|, very easy to use. Good images when used manually. Good price|#|Image quality is poor when using pre-programmed settings where the ISO value is set to auto and not the preferred ISO setting selected by the user. Using ISO settings higher than 400 in manual mode gives some deterioration in image quality when larger images are printed.
9.0|#|silence - rechargable  batts - understandable manual - best in the 45yrs of photography for the price...|#|
9.0|#|any one can takew great pictures.|#|Difficulty in getting the camera case, everywhere is out of stock. No memory card is included in the package.
9.0|#|I like the camera but have to read instructions on CD|#|should be supplied with a case. lense cap a little flimsy but OK, not very fast seems a little slow when taking pictures.
10.0|#||#|Still to find out how to kill the beep - every tiny adjustment causes it to beep - can be annoying to others at public events.  I'll crack this soon.
9.0|#||#|The only thought that I had was that it seemed very lightly built,
8.0|#|Excellent large 12 x optical zoom lens on such a small camera, as good as any SLR cameras but half the size.|#|The main part of the extensive operating manual is on a disc that comes with the camera so you have the choice of sitting at your computer reading it on a pdf file with the camera at your side or printing well over 100 pages of it off.  The full manual has to come with the camera at the time of purchase as a printed booklet.
10.0|#|superb value,surprisingly small,if your happy with the price and its the type of camera your considering..dont hesitate,just buy it before someone else does!|#|No 'image stabilisation'
10.0|#||#|Does not shoot RAW - but I knew this when I bought it - would be a nice refinement though Fuji?
10.0|#|the camera takes good photos   it is small enough tofit in pocket or ladies handbag|#|
10.0|#|A good quality camera,light weight,easy to take onto aircraft in hand luggage|#|
10.0|#|Battery life is excellent using Energiser 2350 ma batteries.  Very easy to use and the super macro is fantastic for close ups. Several manual settings but really only need auto because the image quality is brillioant. Nice and small but not quite a compact.|#|Cant think of any right now.
9.0|#|So far well worth the money!|#|Lack of full manual.Although on disc this doesnt really help if you are out and about and want to try out some of the settings.
9.0|#|the panoramic view is fantastic although you have to keep an extremely steady hand. there are many features which are clearly labelled and give good effects.|#|the panoramic view reqires an extremly steady hand so a tripod may be useful
9.0|#|Much better now that they take SD cards.|#|No real problems so far apart from having to download instruction manual and having to go on the computer everytime I want to check on anything. As my elderly neighbour said recently, 'you're a second class citizen if you haven't got a computer'. Perhaps there should be an easy option to obtain a hard copy for those who can't access a computer or just prefer a hard copy.
9.0|#|Quality camera with a robust feel. Good value, well engineered and designed.|#|think I would prefer a rechargeable lithium battery to the standard AA batteries, but they come in rechargeable form too.
8.0|#|Good quality pictures, easy to use (except the flash which you have to open to use), good zoom and panoramic feature.  I particularly like the AA battery usage instead of carrying a charger, EU plug etc on holiday!|#|the flash up to use it (but it is protected from damage) and the camera wheel setting can easily move when the camera is in a bag
10.0|#|Well build camera, good shape, cant beat the picture colour and quality!|#|Cannot Change image from jpeg!
8.0|#|camera. Not too big either. Feels nice and solid. Some nice additional features over and above a basic full-auto compact, eg. aperture and shutter priority modes. Electronic view finder very useful when high light levels behind camera make screen difficult to see. Seems OK so far, but I am still getting used to it.|#|Not entirely convinced by colour balance of images, but it is early days and I may just be noticing the change from previous camera. If I dont get used to it there is always Photoshop. The mode wheel on top of camera gets turned to random settings when camera is slung over shoulder so need to develop habit of checking the setting before taking picture.
9.0|#|comfortable and lightweight. easy to use menus give good photo's|#|
10.0|#|Fantastic camera! love all the features, since purchase I have taken it everywhere and now have some fantastic shots|#|
9.0|#|ideal for random use by inexperienced photograghers due to the wide zoom range and ten mega-pixel resolution - even at maximum zoom inc digital there is better than 2 mega-pixel resolution|#|
9.0|#|neat little camera with lots of features you'd expect tp pay shed loads more money for. I love the super macro. You can focus in on tiny details really close up with no fuzziness|#|can't think of ny bd points at the moment s I'm still getting used to it
10.0|#|Versatile, beautiful images, easy to master the controls  and great value for money.  Especially like the macro nd panoramic facilities.|#|None, so far.
10.0|#|Additionally I have a Pentax Optio 8 megapixels but the 10 megapixels of the S1000fd is a vast improvement.|#|None
9.0|#|I have not had it long enough to fully check all the features but the good points are being discovered every  time I use it I like the choice of using viewfinder or LCD screen very good in strong sun. Options with memory card are useful too|#|I have not found any yet but the manual is missing a few points but they are covered on the CD instuction manual ,but difficult to carry computer around
10.0|#|Good quality camera, takes good photos and easy to use even for a novice.  Picture quality is excellant with loads of extra features|#|none

10.0|#|It has all the features of a more expensive camera and is so simple to use.|#|I can't find any bad points up to now.
9.0|#|Does eactly what it says on the tin. Great camera for the serious amateur who doesn't want to upgrade to a full DSLR at present.|#|Nothing at present
10.0|#|Easy simple camera to use. Has a good manual with it. Great for close up shots (I have a 1 year old and i've taken some great pictures!). Red eye removal feature is very good. Excellent camera for a good price, would highly recommend.|#|Doesn't come with a camera case. You have to pop-up the flash (it's not automatic), but not necessarily a bad thing, the pictures are generally much better without the flash anyway in my opinion.
8.0|#|Easy to use, big clear screen.good optical zoom|#|no lithium battery
9.0|#|ease of use quality and look of camera|#|a thread to take a filter to protect the lens would be good
10.0|#|This is a good quality camera that has comparable features to many more expensive and bulkier models. I think that even a child could master this camera after spending just 5 minutes reading the manual. This camera has a point a shoot facility where everthing is worked out for you or it can be operated manually for those technically minded people. To sum up, it does exactly what it says on the tin.|#|I cannot find any bad points with this camera, it is exactly what I bought it for.
10.0|#|THIS IS MY SECOND FUJI DIGITAL CAMERA AND I AM JUST AS PLEASED WITH THIS ONE. THIS WAS AN XMAS PRESENT AND HAVEN'T USED IT A GREAT DEAL YET, BUT SO FAR IT EXCEEDS MY EXPECTATIONS.|#|THE ONLY BAD POINT I HAVE FOUND IS THAT THE ZOOM LEVER IS A BIT FLIMSY
10.0|#|Switch between screen or viewfinder, battery life, very easy too use, possible to just point and shoot, still finding out some of the things I can do.|#|No handbook only on CD, Fuji software caused problems with my computer so deleted and just use XP Pro and Serif Photoplus x2
9.0|#|easy to see on screen instructions etc. Excellent zoom range.|#|Difficult to find a suitable camera case to keep it safe that was not too bulky.

Good features for the price.|#|Unable to manually focus when shooting through wire fence or glass, which I could do with my old camera,so unable to pick out a certain subject if there are other obects at different focal lengths.

7.0|#|Good clear photographs although I am still exploring its potential. Light to use and to carry and seems quite robust.|#|A great deal of information to absorb.  The instruction manual requires access to the internet as the printed book is by no means as comprehensive without the internet copy.
9.0|#|fairly easy to use even for a complete beginer, nice to hold, good quality pictures, plenty of features, good zoom|#|only bad point for me is that it uses aa batteries instead of a rechargable one.

9.0|#|very easy to use,very good for my course|#|none
10.0|#|The quality of construction, the electronic viewfinder, the zoom range, both optical and digital are excellent, and in the time I have had to use the product I have found it a delight.  The carrying case ,etc which come in the bundle is excellent, and a wonderful accessory to have - it is robust and spacious, yet light in weight.|#|Perhaps my only minor criticism is the on/off switch with its 'springback' mechanism is sometimes a little difficult to operate; I feel that a two position switch would perhaps be easier.

9.0|#|I am just impressed by the camera, I've never had a Fuji camera before, but it seemed to offer the most for the amount I was prepared to pay.  I am of the older generation and need a camera that I can hold easily and with a viewfinder rather than one of the slim ones with no viewfinder.|#|I think there could be a little more explanation in the instructions booklet, and also a camera case available just for this type of camera.

10.0|#|A compact camera with amazing features, very easy to use.  Picture quality is fantastic and the macro quality is some of the best I've seen.|#|
10.0|#|Easy to use yet with a comprehensive specification. One of the best Finepix yet.|#|Need to watch lens flare
9.0|#|Good value, better made than my prior camera the Kodak Z650, takes normal batteries and the 4AA seem to last fine. Takes SDHC cards as well as normal SD, meaning you can buy / use 4gb, 8gb and 16gb cards. Small size despite comparatively powerful 12X optical zoom.|#|None
9.0|#|The images on the camera are very clear and the zoom is amazing! It's very light in weight and has lots of settings to play around with.  I'd definately recommend it!|#|You have to have a bit of a steady hand when taking pictures of moving things, like if you are at gigs and if there is music with a loud bass, it can effect the quality of the sound overall but is generally very good.
9.0|#|Great for the advanced user who wants lots of control.|#|Lens cap falls off.  No front lens thread for a filter.  Not yet sure about face detection sharpness.

10.0|#|absolutely Fab camera especially if, like me you have small hands. fantastic images and Macro is a real boon.|#|
9.0|#|Good telephoto lens for size and cost of camera. Good choice of programs.|#|Flash not powerful but OK.
9.0|#|Another excellent Fuji camera|#|Can't zoom when using video - screen would be better if recessed to avoid fingerprints and glare.
9.0|#|takes fantastic landscape shots.the picture quality is very good....a easy camera to use.|#|i would never take it on a night out because its a little bulky
9.0|#|Use of AA batteries|#|
9.0|#|easy to use compact light fits in handbag brilliant photos best camera i have used|#|
10.0|#|superb wide range on lens . Big screen for such a small camera .Panoramic feature is marvelous. Simple to use for an average guy. Standard type batteries,rechargables even. and not expensive specials.|#|None for a keen amateur, but a changeable lens feature would benefit a more  advanced photographer.
8.0|#||#|The shutter speed is insufficient to capture quality 'moving' pictures
5.0|#|Price.|#|The battery compartment has to be opened to remove the memory card and this is awkward and inconvenient compared to the S5700.  The zoom judders and the focussing is MUCH slower and less accurate than the S5700. The quality of image is not as good as the S5700. The batteries run out quite quickly. It is not a good idea to buy a camera without being able to try its features. The time it takes to try out the number of features this camera has, means that, by the time you've decided you wish you hadn't changed models, it's too late to send it back.
10.0|#|just the right size|#|
9.0|#|Great Camera with good picture quality and the optical zoom is excellent for distance pictures.|#|The knob to change settings is easily changed when in a camera bag you'll need to check this before you take your photo.
9.0|#||#|There could be a way of setting the exposure time to whatever you want, not just the pre programmed ones. Again not really expected at this price.

8.0|#|Nice light and compact for carrying|#|not found any yet but i am a beginner
7.0|#|nice camera generally|#|finish looks cheap and the battery compartment is not explained how to open sufficiently as its easy to think it faulty as no where says you slide it to the side - you expect it to pop up
8.0|#|Continuous mode for moving images.|#|Delay while autofocus identifies best place on all settings, losing some action shots.
9.0|#|Does what I expected it to do.|#|Battery life a bit short.
10.0|#|Bought this for my husband who liked the look of an SLR, but could never afford one, or indeed need one.  This camera is excellent and ticks all the boxes.  Completely idiot proof with great features.  He is delighted with it.|#|None
2.0|#|Uses AA batteries|#|Image quality at higher ISO and/or longer focal lengths is absolutely abysmal. Lots of noise and general unsharpness. Wouldn't recommend this one to anyone who actually cares about getting a quality shot.
10.0|#|a high quality product with features only found in higher priced cameras|#|the effects of manual settings are not clearly explained in the manual

9.0|#|This is my first digital camera and I must say I am very pleased with it. Image quality is excellent on 6 x 4 pictures which is my preferred photo size. Setting up, taking and reviewing the photos is quite straightforward and the camera is a pleasure to use. A 2g memory card on the best picture seting gave several hundred photos during the cameras first use on visits to Russia and China.|#|There are none as regards the use and results from the camera but battery life does appear somewhat short and the time beteween warning of this and the camera dying also seems short.
10.0|#|i was pleased to be able to buy a good quality camera with 10 optical zoom at a very reasonable price. i've found it fairly easy to use  and am very happy with picture quality at any distance|#|not found any yet

9.0|#|easy to use and a great quality image every time.  What a bargain too.  I have been wanting to move from film to digital for a while and this was a great way to dip my toe into the water without spending hundreds of pounds.  A great starter kit.|#|it takes a long time to read the book and try to understand all of the features and options.  A quick summary guide would be useful especiall for all the menus.
10.0|#|battery last a long time.real easy to use. just like compact camera but with extra features|#|nil
9.0|#|Excelllent features and very easy to use. The information provided on lcd screen when rotating through features is excellent and you do not need to use the manual unless you want to use the more advanced faetures.|#|None as yet.
9.0|#|Excellent lens and fast operation.|#|No lens hood which leads to lens flare.
10.0|#|Great zoom and very easy to use.  Battery life is pretty good with my rechargables, much better than cameras I have had in the past that eat the battery power up.|#|It is a large camera but it had all the features I wanted at a great price so who cares!  I like the style.  One day I will upgrade to digi SLR.  This is a good starting point though.
9.0|#|xd takes normal aa batteries if stuck with uncharged ones. absolutely fab camera. video mode is superb|#|the flash takes a bit of getting used to as you tend to hold that side at first. if it had face detection would have given 10/10
8.0|#|Being able to swap from viewfinder to LCD screen for different situations. Batteries appear to last a long time|#|Finding it a little difficult to hold comfortably, but I've been used to compact cameras until this camera
10.0|#|Ease of use, great zoom lens that doesn't extened from the camera, when zooming in on a distant subject. Value for money I would give this 12/10 if I could.|#|Software is not the best.
10.0|#|I love the handling and shape of the camera.  The weight is excellent.  I like the picture quality and user friendly menues|#|None
9.0|#|Enough features and options for the photography enthusiast while still being easy to pick up and instantly use.|#|should have a protective cover of some form - lens cap falls off easily.
9.0|#|very easy to use, large lcd excellent picture quality long life battery use|#|cant think of any at the present time
9.0|#|You can use the product one handed and the zoom is great (10x is better than the 3x you often get on digital cameras). I also like the fact it takes both SD and XD cards.|#|The strap is not good and you couldn't rely on it to carry the camera about (I bought a case)
9.0|#|Extremely easy to use, and to get good results.  And with the various options available, a user can make taking a photo as easy or simple or as challenging as they want.|#|A lot of the features that have an SLR-type function are buried in other menus (ie adjusting aperture).  As a result, it can be complicated to find them and to use them, and the manual can be a bit clunky.  But as this isn't the main function of this camera, it's not a huge obstacle to using it.
9.0|#|Ease of use, a superb combination of still and video, handles both jobs with ease. Anyone want a second hand mini disc video camera? now obsolete since purchase of S5700 !!|#|Lense cover falls off every time camera is taken from carry bag!!
9.0|#|There is a 10 x optical zoom, so you can get really good quality pictures of views and scenes that are a distance away.|#|It does take a bit of time to find the different settings and remember where they are!

8.0|#|Value for money. Extremely good hand grip, balance and weight is good. Not too complex to use. To date the battery life is good.  Extremely stylish design.|#|lens cap is easily dislodged so ensure you have the cap attached to the camera with the lead supplied!
9.0|#|The trimming facility which lets you zoom in on a picture and capture that enlarged image.|#|None so far
9.0|#|Good range of functions. Really easy to learn. Size and weight convenient. Love it!|#|
6.0|#|Its really cheap! Easy to use. Nice zoom.|#|Image quality is well below par, bad grain, poor skin tones and heavy purple fringing. Don't try and use it inside because the results are awfull.
10.0|#|t fault the camera A++++++++++++++++++++|#|None
7.0|#|good 10x zoom, good flash and video quality|#|extra modes more difficult to set up and use effectively than on other cameras and low light photography without using flash is always blurred, flash is always set at 100% and cannot be adjusted to suit the environment, can cause some colour loss and over-exposure in medium light conditions where just to dark without the flash.
10.0|#|It looks attractive, easy to hold and operate.It's nice to feel you have a camera in your hands unlike many digital cameras which are the size of a cigarette packet.Small is not always beautiful.|#|I have'nt found any as yet...and I don't think I will
9.0|#|This camera is very easy to handle. Controls are fairly straight forward. As a spectacle wearer I find the electronic viewfinder to be excellent. The camera copes well with varied lighting conditions. The zoom is superbly smooth.|#|Too bulky to be used as a pocket camera unless one has very large pockets.
9.0|#|Great value for money. Really good picture quality and macro mode. Can use as a point and shoot but it has a good range of more advanced features.|#|
10.0|#|It's light, easy to handle (being comfotable in the hand) all round good camera.|#|
10.0|#|good value for money.|#|accessories can be expensive
10.0|#|Easy to take good quality photos, lots of features. good macro. you can purchase filters e.t.c to screw on the lens, unlike most point and shoot cameras. good zoom for non SLR.|#|
10.0|#|This camera is great, easy to use, picture quality is very good and the video feature is great too.|#|The only bad point is the fact it has digital zoom, i still don't understand why digital camera's still have this feature.  It makes photo's look grainy.
9.0|#|Easy to set up and use in basic mode - plenty of features to play with if you're feeling adventurous.  Natural light and flash/natural light mode really useful.  Very easy and comfortable to hold.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|A really good value, light weight, easy to use. and also it looks very nice|#|Uses too much batery
7.0|#|Generally easy to use and versatile|#|If you what to photograph fast action then even in sport mode this camera is a bit slow.
9.0|#|The zoom! A 10x optical zoon on a camera for this price was the main selling point for me, and I'm really impressed with it. I also like the dual-shot mode that lets you take 2 pictures in quick succession, 1 with flash and one without.|#|Only real bad point is that on a sunny day, blue skies often come out white, however, I have found this with every digital camera I have owned.
10.0|#|I have actually purchased 2 of these now, one for me and one for my parents. It really is a case of point and shoot for excellent quality photographs, and one button push for close ups!|#|I still haven't found any, honestly could not be happier with my purchase.
10.0|#|This is an excellent little camera....I find it takes very good quality images for someone into photography but who cant afford an SLR!! Excellent value for money also!|#|The only thing i think is a let down is it doesnt have its own lithium chargable battery....this would be good!!
8.0|#|Excellent zoom|#|Non-rechargable batteries

10.0|#|simple to use lots of features, great photo quality|#|flimsy battery flap
10.0|#|just a brilliant all round camera|#|would have been better if one big rechargable battery instead of 4 smaller one
10.0|#|For the money it does about everything you could ask for hence the 10/10 scores. The optical zoom adds so much and makes it easy to get in tight, I tried a close up of my partner playing the French Horn in a dimly lit Church without flash from about 30 metres away and the results were excellent.|#|I don't like the pop up flash, it works fine but I tend to have my fingers in the way when it tries to deploy and I can't see any reason why it has to pop up rather than be there all the time
8.0|#|Excellent zoom and good build quality, seems larger than you think but fits in my hand perfectly and its not heavy either despite the four AA batteries|#|Screen smudges easily but small issue and make sure you carry a spare pack of batteries

9.0|#|handles like an SLR which is what I was after, having always used 35mm SLR's. With the upgraded card it can take hundreds of pictures which is great for holidays (no rolls of film everywhere!!) Particularly liked the fixed lens (no dirt inside or sand while changing lenses on holiday!)Coupled with a good printer the photos are first rate. More than happy with the camera and the price paid.|#|The menu buttons setting up can be a bit trying(probably 'cos I am an older user and a technophobe!!)
9.0|#|EAsy to use, gives great results. Love the manual focus and zoom it really extends battery life and its much quicker than auto zoom! Fantastic camera. Good that you have the option to save in RAW.|#|Really hard to find good quality lense converters.

9.0|#|Face detection is very reliable and works well, very fast.  Manual zoom ring is a dream.  Shutter speeds cover almost every situation.  Comparative successive shots is great.  Feel of the camera in the hand is good with an excellent grip and stability possible.  Anti-shake is much better than reviewers suggested.|#|Card slot door sometimes opens and leaves you wondering why the camera wont fire up.  Choosing a scene is not altogether intuitive.
9.0|#|All the features of a traditional SLR with  the advantages of digital photography.|#|Should be sold with a case (even at extra cost).

9.0|#||#|Very few really - would benefit from a hot shoe to allow external flash to be used.
9.0|#|The fact that the lens goes down to 28mm makes such a difference. The video quality is excellent and that was one of the main reasons for buying it as I wanted that to be a good feature and not a gimic. The face detection seems to work well and you can shoot straight from the box on auto. Battery life is excellent.|#|Flash is too bright at close range and the xd cards are more expensive.

8.0|#|Good compromise between SLR and compact, has low weight compared to SLR, but good focal range with the macros through to the zoom. Low noise pictures. High speed focus mode is great for action shots|#|Can get overwhelmed by choice of facilities, but no obvious ones I'd want to lose.

However, for the price this must be the best one out there. By miles.|#|If I 'm forced to criticise, the build quality is a little bit plasticky. And make sure you get rechargable batteries (two sets) as it uses a lot of power. Nonetheless, I can't work out how they've done this for the price, it really is that good.

10.0|#|Feels just like an SLR camera and the build quality is fantastic. The lens is great for all situations for the average family.

10.0|#|So easy to use. Has quality of image and features that you would normally only expect in a much more expensive camera. Excellent zoom - being able to go from wide angle to 300 without having to change lenses is a great advantage. Macro, super macro excellent, Digital zoom boost very useful when the subject is just too far away for normal zoom. An excellent camera for a modest price -highly recommended.|#|Have't found any yet.

10.0|#|As a previous user of Fuji cameras I expected a high quality of product and was not disappointed|#|Suitable protective cases proved to be slightly bulky for carrying.
9.0|#|We use it as a family camera (it is often used in the Auto mode by my wife and even 5-year old son). It has many manual options that I use to get more artistic effects. The 10x optical zoom is a very useful feature. At the same time a camera is small (compared to the size of professional cameras with tele photo lenses). I really like that fact that I can also record short audio clips (up to 30 seconds) accompanying my photos (I merge photos and audio in Power Point).|#|Manual zoom is difficult to use.

9.0|#|Ease of use and menu structure|#|Nothing significant.  Photo card had to be re-initialised due to failure.  Difffcult to find how to do this!
10.0|#||#|the disc that came with the camera was disappointing there was a use limit if you wanted to write onto dvd discs it would of been better if disc had not been supplied as it only has one feature to write on cd left after three attempts!also would of been nice to of had some kind of case free even if you added it to the price rather than sell seperately.
10.0|#|Very good value for money, excellent image quality, lots of feautres that are easy to select and use. Batteries seem to last forever. Menus straight forward as a Nokia, as all Fuji Finepix cameras are.|#|Zooming is performed by pressing Wide/Tele buttons (in the back of the body near the display), rather than by rotating the body of the lens, which in S5600 is fixed in a barrel. While this may be inconvenient in the beginning, you soon get used to it. Not exactly a problem.

9.0|#|AUTO setting is fine for most things, but PASM settings provide plenty of control for more complex shots.  I was especially impressed by the indoor shots without flash, which while a little grainy (to be expected) are perfectly in focus and with minimal motion blur.  Colours are also nice and vivid, especially when using the special FinePix Color F-chrome setting!  The zoom is also very responsive and focuses while zooming|#|The cover that protects the USB, A/V out, etc. sockets is just a piece of rubber that slots into the holes.  I can see this falling apart over time, or refusing to stay in.  The LCD viewfinder is of reasonable quality, but once your eye is up to it it's hard to get to the controls on the back of the camera.

9.0|#|Build quality overall seems very good.  The lack of digital shutter delay is excellent and involving - if you miss a shot it's not the camera's fault. Manual features and overrides are good. Fast f2 lens is great.  The built in flash is good, if a bit bright, but it is easily turned down.|#|I recognise that some of the above are down to me, and this is why I still highly rate, and would recommend with reservations, this camera.

10.0|#|Physically it's a small unit which perfect for me as I'm petite, so its nice to have a camera that doesn't feel too heavy and bulky.|#|It doesn't have a rechargeable battery but takes 4x AA batteries (which came supplied).

10.0|#|Easy to use straight from the box.  All features easy to use ( even for a beginner like myself).  User manual easy to understand and explains everything in simple terms.  Brilliant results on first use.|#|Flash did not work.  In process of being replaced.  No hassle
9.0|#|really easy to use and gives exceptional quality results. A great camera for those who have aspirations just short of an SLR.|#|None. I wish I'd bought this before my point and shoot as it is just as easy to use but with far greater results
7.0|#|Useful as pocket camera. fantastic range from macro to great zoom.|#|Takes AA batteries. Would prefer camera's own recharageable battery.
9.0|#|If you cant get the shot you want with this camera, you probably need to get someone else to take the photo!|#|Flash unit a little bit flimsy and neck strap not chunky enough. Electronic veiwfinder image quality not great, as per normal with EVF's. Could do with seperate covers for battery and memory card.
10.0|#|Being an amatuer photographer i found this camera really east to use straight away, The image quality is very good and the panoramic function is great, I have recommended this camera to some of my friends and family.|#|I was a little disappointed that it came without an SD card as i was eager to use it when it arrived but couldnt, Also i cant find a timer so that i can take a picture of myself..Oh well...

9.0|#|Good balance in hands. LOVE this camera, Love Fuji cameras. Good build quality, looks more expensive than is, Look like and even take pics like a pro|#|It was much bigger in size than I expected, nearly twice as big as my S1000fd which I'd upgraded from, so needed to buy a new bigger camera bag. Don't like the fact that you manually lift up the flash or won't work, or that if you forget to take the lens cap off, you get an error message on screen, but apart from those niggles, Brilliant camera

Some subjects can take a little longer to focus than I would like, and the build quality is very plasticky - and I feel as if I'm going to break the battery door cover every time I open it!!

8.0|#|good  zoom    good  pictures  quite   easy  to  use|#|flash  wouldnt  work  seems  to  be  a  common  problem
8.0|#|Low Priced with a good zoom range. AA batteries are easy to get away from home. and there is no problem obtaining rechargeable ones at a reasonable price. The camera is easy to use gives quite good quality pictures I would recommend the camera as it is well priced and gives good quality photos, and has a good range of settings. Overall This camera can do what it is asked with some limitations and you get a lot for the price, but if you want quality a low priced DSLR would give better photos, but you would not get the easy to carry all in one package.|#|Small sensor give lower quality. HD movie is not too good and the optical zoom is picked up by the mic, and it also goes out of focus then corrects when zooming. The still photos have quite good centre definition but the edges  left side is the worst degrades. Aperture Priority is F3.5 and it uses a ND filter for F8 so you are unable to control depth of field.
9.0|#|Light, Zoom, Features, looks like a pro cam, we bought 2 for family members and they both love it. A 16GB SD card (around £8 less P+P) gives over 4k pics @ highest setting :-) but only 9 mins approx of 720p footage, but hey its a camera and not a camcorder.|#|Uses standard x4 AA batteries which can have an advantage but prefer own re-chargeables.

9.0|#|Excellent image quality. Lightweight. Autofocus better than expected. Fun to use.|#|Lenses too expensive.
9.0|#|It is a great camera. Well built, great image quality and looks really nice. Proper size and has interchangable lenses.|#|You do need some knowledge about manual mode on the camera to get most of it. Also, first few days will be quite difficult once you go through  all the features and modes. But once you do it, it will be so easy to use this camera
5.0|#|Excellent build quality.|#|Not sure about the metering,  images  very dark. disappointed. This was to replace DSLR's but sadly had to return as not up to them.

8.0|#|S could write just the RAW file! It is just hard to say enough good about this camera. It is the first time that I have been able to go on a casual hike without worrying if I made a mistake by leaving the DSLR behind.|#|There are two things I strongly dislike and a couple of smaller annoyances. One is software related though........ I really disliked the RAW conversion software they included. Adobe now has an ARC update soon, so that problem is solved if you use Adobe products be. The other big issue is with the manual focusing. You spin that little dial around the menu button to control the focusing. It is just too small and hard to control well. The minor things I would change is to allow programming of the RAW button and the addition of lower shutter speeds. If you are a RAW shooter, you just set this in the menu (like your DSLR), making the button unnecessary. Now if I could program it with another function...
9.0|#|.|#|does not accommodate the hood, (hood has to be removed when the front of the case is re-attached).
8.0|#|Superb natural Fujifilm style colours in images.|#|Anti-shake stabilizer does not appear to be very effective so far.
10.0|#|experiment in manual mode. All in all a great compact camera for either a pro, who wants to be discrete or a novice who's willing to read the manual and learn new tricks.|#|Menus are a bit confusing to begin with but after studying the manual and having a play, it all falls into place.
10.0|#|This answered my need perfectly as a small camera to keep with me all the time. I am a Nikon D700 and D90 user for 'projects' and this is a fantastic addition to the family. I was initially after a Nikon 1 but much preferred this and just love the rangefinder retro styling!|#|none so far
10.0|#|Note, for all that are critical that you have to remove the lens cap to turn on the camera to even view photos. Read the instructions - by simply pressing and holding the playback button for a second the camera will power up.|#|None

9.0|#|Brilliant EXR mode incorporates many features to improve image clarity|#|
10.0|#|Takes a little practice to master all the things this camera can do, but well worth the effort. Superb, simple and easy to use viewfinder for grabbing those quick shots or for when the sun not being kind to LCD screens.  A traditional design and layout  makes it comfortable and practical to use and the quality of the images produced makes this, a take it everywhere, semi-pro bit of kit.|#|Not really.

10.0|#|I love the X10! Superb image quality and a fantastic range of features, amazing low-light imaging. This is the only camera I will ever need, friends are very impressed with photos I have taken with it. Superb build quality too.|#|It can take a little bit time to get familiar with it if wanting custom settings, it is feature-packed. If in doubt just put it on Auto or EXR mode, you can't go wrong. Its not really a negative point, to be expected when there are so many great features.
9.0|#|ready access.I really enjoy using it! It is a good solid feeling little camera which I take everywhere.|#|with a bit of practice they are not too bad to navigate through.
10.0|#|Stunning image quality, awesome low-light ability, manual zoom, retro gorgeousness, small package, ease of use. Truly desirable package with breathtaking ability.|#|OK, it's a luxury price for a compact and marginally larger than the smallest compacts but actually should be comparing to SLRs anyway as that's where picture quality compares.
8.0|#|superb build quality and too many features to mention, great size for an always with travel camera|#|none as I had done my research and am well aware of the limitations of this camera compared to my dslr which it will replace for travel photography

9.0|#|looks lovely. takes fantastic stunning pictures|#|the orbs. Well not really an issue when I've taken 4-500 pictures and if I'm really really looking I can spot it in one picture.

9.0|#|Combination of image quality from smaller sensor, great lens, terrific image processing, convenience of a view finder, fun to use, storming exr modes combine ease with great results, excellent low light results... List goes on.!|#|Menu can seem non-intuitive at first (and yep its not the easiest), buying a spare battery is essential, viewfinder is offset slightly in the vertical so you need to adjust positioning of object of centre focus when using the vf.
10.0|#|Loads of options|#|Takes a while to get used to (but definitely worth having the manuel features)
9.0|#|The x4 zoom makes for useful flexibility.|#|

You buy a camera to take pictures, which this one does perfectly.|#|No shooting information or focus confirmation in optical viewfinder, only on rear screen.

9.0|#|Looks fab and  works really well as a middle of the road camera - I use the photos to get professional looking shots as I use the photos for a living, but am a very amateur amateur if that makes sense!|#|Battery runs out with no warning at all, even though the battery life is generally good, so can't complain about that!
8.0|#||#|A little big for a compact camera : not for a pocket !
9.0|#|Nice size, excellent image quality and lots of features.  Super macro mode is amazing, beats my DSLR hands down!  Quick buttons make it very easy to switch between all modes and settings.|#|No EVF but then with the small size and small price I can't really complain.  It does take a bit of time to get used to composing on a screen instead of a viewfinder but it's not too bad.
7.0|#|Classic design, mechanical zoom.|#|Large, heavy, poor image quality in low light due to small sensor.
8.0|#|Very versatile. Seems to have a setting for every situation. But that means it's not as simple to operate as some cameras. The manual zoom is a joy. A good study of the instruction book is reccomended.|#|The battery life could be better, but additional batteries are readily available.  I  get my finger in shot sometimes but that may be just because I'm clumsy. One needs to be aware of it when using the zoom.
8.0|#|The image quality is very good and it is not too complicate to use. It is comfortable to hold.|#|I find the discrepency between the optical and the digital viewfinders a little off-putting and don't like the lens blocking some of the image through the optical view finder. But early days and I am sure I'll adjust, but would have liked not to have to.
9.0|#|Comprehensive set of controls very similar to an SLR.  Love the panarama setting.  The quality for the price is fantastic.  Shoots in RAW format for greater control over your shots in lightroom etc. It feels very strong and rigid when using it and you feel it can take a bit of stick whilst on your travels.  Images are excellent|#|No information when looking through viewfinder, instruction book not very comprehensive.  Would have loved a bit more zoom. Battery life not very good probably just a few days life when shooting.

The picture quality and clarity is fantastic also. I've run over 300 shots using the zoom, flash etc and still on the original batteries, this one one of my concerns as it takes 4xAA's, so am very impressed.|#|The indepth manual is on disc, which is a little inconvienient when  on holiday without laptop and disc, so do your homework and learn your way round your camera before your all important holiday...............

10.0|#|Amazing zoom, excellent picture quality.  Good variations in system settings for example: shutter speed, ISO settings.  This is my first SLR type camera and a very good camera to start with, it takes excellent top quality pics and panaromic views.  Worth spending time to read instructions as it has lots of additional features.  Very good camera for introduction to photography :-)|#|none found as yet .. only had camera for 2months and very happy with all features so far.

10.0|#|At 10 meg the camera has very clear images. Extreme close-up capabilities, I have taken clear picture with the subject touching the glass of the lens. love it. With the same lens I get quite good telephoto pictures. The shape of the camera is very easy to hold, you can honestly get a firm grip on the camera. The dual view finder is great. The large screen on the back is clear but the same image in a conventional electronic view finder is great. The batteries last a long time, even if I use the flash in 10% of the pictures. The ability to take pictures in low light conditions without the use of flash is startling. It takes good movies, and the many ways you can manipulate the images before and after taking pictures is wonderful, and it's all built in. Electronic digital cameras don't make noise so Fugi makes the camera make noise so you know when your picture has been taken. This sound can be turned off so others don't have to know or be bothered/distracted by the noise. I have had several rather good digital cameras but the number of pictures I could take was limited. There were greater capacity chips but my other cameras would choke on them if I used a biger than 2 gig chip. With the Fugi I can easily use an 8 gig chip and capture my whole summer on one chip.  This camera is a simple as a point and shoot, but it has functions that go way beyound the price tag, You will not know all the functions in a week of steady use, yet a child can use it well right away.|#|Although not a tiny camera, with my big hands, I find myself pushing a few buttons I didn't intend to. There is a delay between pushing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture. I find if I push the shutter button half way to pre-focus the lens, when I do push the shutter in earnest, it is much faster.

9.0|#|Good lay out of controls and easy to use.|#|
8.0|#|I have read many reviews of this camera and was reluctant to spend the £180 being asked by other online retailers. When I saw the simply electronics price I decided to take the plunge. I have had the camera for a month now and it would reccomend it to people who want a step up from a compact camera. It is very well made and the picture quality is very good for a camera of this (cheaper) price. The video quality is very good, I cant believe that it is only VGA !  The optical zoom is very good and the flash is adequate for most situations. The controls are well laid out and menus are fairly straightforward. The panorama stitching works very well and I look forward to using it on my holidays in the future.|#|I have noticed motor noise on when playing back video, this is because the inbuilt microphone is mounted on the body very close to the motors that alter the focus/zoom. I have been unable to get the fuji manual (pdf cd) to run on my p.c. I will try to find it elsewhere on line. Also the photos have to be extracted from the camera via the usb cable and fuji software, they will not load from the memory card when inserted in my p.c's card reader.
8.0|#|easy to use, good picture quality, big screen|#|no black and white feature (well I can't find it)
9.0|#|I like the size of the camera and the fact that you look through the lens like you do with a SLR, thde zoom's superb and the programs are good also.|#|I would have liked to have been able to have a screw thread to fit a glass filter.
10.0|#|The Fuji FinePixs S1500 is a very compacked camera, lots of feature (too many to mention). Eletronic view finder (very good on bright and sunny day's). 3 inch Screen. When you purchase this camera, it comes with 4 AA batteries (not rechargable).|#|The battery compartment door is fidderly to open and close (you have to slide a small button to the side, and then slide the battery door to the side at the same time). This process is a little harder when closing the door (a little pressure is needed downwards onto the batterys).

9.0|#|Easy to use and value for money. Very good picture quality and shake proof is excellent. Brilliant love it.|#|
8.0|#|Excellent picture quality. The viewfinder as well as the LCD is a big help.|#|Like most cameras, it's virtually impossible to see anything - including any camera settings - in the LCD screen in bright light.. Although the viewfinder is a big help, the view is very small
10.0|#|light weight and easy to use with good quality picture results|#|lens cap keeps falling off leaving the lense exposed
10.0|#|Very easy to use and its price is very competitive considering its features and good quality.|#|Its internal memory is rather small and a memory card, which has to be purchased separately, is indispensable. It consumes a lot of power and one has to replace or recharge the batteries after several hours of service.

10.0|#|easy to handle|#|non that iv found so far
8.0|#|Zoom seems quick to use. Generally quite easy to use.|#|Using the EVF the image does not seem sharp although the taken image is sharp. It is not quick to change from one SP programme to another. In SR Auto it occasionally appears to make strange choices of mode. If the camera is turned on with the lenscap fitted you have to turn the camera off and start again. This is unfortunate if you are trying to take a picture in a hurry or just wish to review pictures in the memory.

10.0|#|Value for money. Ease of use.|#|
9.0|#|good image quality, particularly the macro images, good manual Joom and good features|#|no image stabilisation in auto mode, not a welcoming feature for beginners
10.0|#|This is a good all rounder. There are plenty of features for an advanced user along with a full Auto mode for the 'point and shoot' person. Image quality is great and the lens is superb. I have found this to be a fantastic addition to my camera kit that I regularly use as an alternative to my Digital SLR at times I don't want the hassle of carrying around all the kit and lenses. The lens is equivalent to 28-300mm on an SLR. The f-stop range isn't quite as good as separate SLR lenses but there are no complaints with what I want it for. It also takes standard AA batteries (x4) so there are no expensive battery packs to buy. I keep a set fully charged as spares in my bag along with the ones in the camera. I suggest you buy at least 2500mAh rechargeables though. It'll save you a fortune over standard Alkaline batteries. I thoroughly recommmend it to anyone.|#|I haven't found any yet!
10.0|#|Everything is good regarding this camera.I shopped around and no one could touch the price this is offered for.I have belonged a camera club for a great number of years and appreciate a quality camera.|#|Only one and it is a screamer............Why is no XD card included.........this can be a let down if purchased as a present.
10.0|#|i liked the way it felt when holding the camera all the bottons you need are close to hand the lens seems very good and it take pictures very quickly in any condition.Also you don't need to read a massive manual to get the thing working.The fact that it takes two memory cards is a bonus.|#|The only bad point i found which is very very small is you carn't transfer images from one mermory card to the other, but im not going to lose sleep over it
10.0|#|The two outstanding features are the brightness - I rarely have to use the flash which gives much more natural shots - and the mechanical zoom which is so much better than a motorised one.  You can get the exact zoom you want and much more quickly.|#|Would have preferred a slightly smaller build.
10.0|#|This camera has more tricks up it's sleve than Richard Nixon.Its really amazing trick is to take pictures indoors which are superior to any taken with flash. I have still to try my flashgun on the hot shoe but at this rate, it will be mothballed together with my 35mm SLR! As I write this, I am in the Canadian Rocky mountains and have taken over 500 pictures. Due to the cost of film, I would have limited my shots to under 200 so far. I have taken wildlife pictures, reviewed them, discarded poor or out of focus pictures and taken the shot again till it's what I want. That would have used half a roll ot CT100!|#|Only one. I miss the clarity of eye level view you get with an SLR but I don't miss the heavy gadget bag with all the lenses or the hole in my wallet.
10.0|#|Fuji is great value for money.|#|None so far
10.0|#|Very versatile camera|#|
9.0|#|Almost everything you try to do can be mastered after some practice and the instructioon manual is first class.|#|Manual focusing is very difficult to achieve
8.0|#|The image quality is good providing you READ THE MANUAL, this is a complex piece of gear and will reward practice, you can always erase any mistakes.|#|
9.0|#|If the light is good it works very well.|#|In dull conditions I get poor results compared with my S5500 but it may be due to my handling of settings.Maybe I need to practice more.Too complicated for me and Auto does not seem to overcome my shortcomings
10.0|#|Easy to handle, packed full of features but not too heavy to use.|#|cant think of any!
9.0|#|Excellent choice of options from fully automatic to fully manual. As close to a digital SLR as you can get without actually buying one. Lots of control, very good bundled software, very good optical zoom. RAW shooting mode is an excellent feature on this mid-priced model. Lens feels cheep and delicate but delivers the goods well and is stronger than first thought. 58mm filter adapter is invaluable (get an ND4 filter for shooting in bright sunlight).|#|Not always fully focused pictures. Amount of control options would intimidate an amateur (however fully auto mode is pretty good). Noticeable JPEG artifacts in poor lighting.
9.0|#|Good product which produces good quality photographs. It is convenient in size and results as good as DSLR I have. It is more convenient to use having a very good length zoom lens without having to keep changing lens and risking dust getting onto sensor, which I have experienced with DSLR. The Fuji Super CCD's do seem to produce an excellent colour balance.|#|
3.0|#||#|very grainy images
9.0|#|Easy to use in auto mode but with great features for the more experienced photographer. Great Picture Quality.|#|none yet
9.0|#|The pop-up flash is convenient too.|#|LCD is a bit too small and there are so many features and knobs, buttons, etc, it can be a bit fiddly to make a quick change of setting. It eats batteries but I recommend getting 4*AA 2500mah NiMh rechargeables with a Uniross 15 min express charger and you can snap to your hearts content.
4.0|#|i also has Fuji 7000, and this is higher model of that. same fetures and easy to use|#|the quality of image is not very good, if image is little bit under explossure, it will show the pixel in the picture. so we can not currect the level from the photoshop. not very good for night photography and flash photography.

10.0|#|Manual zoom, Zoom range,LCD excelent for low shots.|#|none
10.0|#|The Fuji S9600 Zoom has all the features of a digital SLR at around a quarter the price and without the hassle of carrying around extra lenses. Also, you can take video, which you can't on an SLR. I like the manual focus as sometimes auto-focussing doesn't pick exactly the spot you want absolutely in focus, and the majority of the button/dial controls are easily accessible while you are taking a shot. More plusses are being able to use filters, an external flashgun, cable release etc and the brilliant quality of macro shots.|#|The Photometry (metering method) dial is small and fiddly and in an awkward place; my little digital compact Fuji F700 Zoom just has a button to press to change those settings. When the ISO setting is high there is quite a lot of speckling in the pictures, though that's also the case with many other digital cameras.
8.0|#||#|The lens has acceptable optics but I feel that the image degrades more than expected on maximum zoom. Overall, good images can be achieved with experimentation.
10.0|#|Excellent range of features - almost on a par with a digital SLR - and superb image quality.  Wonderful lens with 28-300mm range which would cost almost double for an equivalent DSLR setup.|#|None so far.

9.0|#|Very good value for money and easy to use. Battery life is outstanding. It is very robust and well made. I brought this for the lens range, and I wasn't dissapointed; wide angle to super zoom|#|Image quality is not quite as good as expected, when taking pictures in non perfect settings, but acceptable given the price. Zoom takes a little getting used to, as there is no fine control over it.
10.0|#|Easy to use once the book has been read.|#|The weight of the camera.
9.0|#|Control  switches  not  to  small  or  tightly  clustered  i.e.  when  selecting  ONE,  you  don`t  get  a  bunch.|#|Not  found  any  up  to  the  present.
9.0|#|as a bridge camera it does what it says it would in the blurb and as such is a good buy.|#|battery replacement is a bit of a job.
10.0|#|Features that I particularly like are the continuous shooting and the great zoom qualities.|#|Haven't found any yet!
9.0|#|Light, easy to use.|#|
10.0|#|The camera fits perfectly and very comfortably in your right hand. Controls are easy to manipulate. Settings allow for full manual control or if you are not sure let the camera take over ( auto ). Took very crisp and well focused pictures of an energetic toddler. It is essential to take time and read the owner's manual. Use tripod. Even the simplest one (tread and weight) did wonders when using the full zoom. The macro settings are amazing and the pictures taken are true to the life object. The 4 NiMH batteries surprisingly lasted for 4 days and over 900 photos and 20 short (about 8 min. each) movies.|#|When shooting movies the noise, if you zoom, is recorded. I don't mind a lot because usually the action I am filming is quite noisy anyway. In bright daylight the screen shows some stripes and streaks alternating between the real colour and a washed one BUT the photo taken is not affected. You need to read the manual!
9.0|#|Very Good Value camera, suitable for simple Point and Shoot Shots and Professional Photography.|#|
10.0|#|Excellent all rounder for the price. Can also take hundreds of photos with additional memory card in place.|#|Zoom is a little quick and you cant control the speed at which the zoom works, not a prob for stills but for movies will appear a little jerky.
9.0|#|Easy to use, HD video works with the optical zoom. Photos are very clear even in poor lighting due to its high ISO, the battery life is also good. For the price this is a perfect Bridge Camera.|#|No case included, althougth a case can be purchased cheaply
10.0|#|the ease of use is perfect the pictures are clear and the video is fantastic|#|the battery life is poor a re-chargable lithiam battery would be so much better but l just make sure l have enough spare batteries with me
10.0|#|I love the optical zoom and the anti-shake function. Also that there is a couple of night functions.|#|Slightly difficult to hold in the right hand so as not to press any buttons.
9.0|#|Excellent close up pictures and is really good at picking up forefront objects against a background. The sunset mode is particularly good. The zoom is great, although a little blurred at maximum when the object is quite far. The camera is quite compact and not too bulky so is easily portable.|#|When using zoom can be difficult to hold still and can result in blurring. Can take time to switch between different modes, especially when switching from still shots to video (takes time to load), which can be a pain when you are wanting to video in a hurry.
8.0|#|zoom feature. HD video. Ease of use.|#|Should be sold with a case

8.0|#|I find it hard to rate, as I have not tried others, though I did a good bit of research, and am very happy.|#|
10.0|#|I brought this camera as a progression from a simple point and shoot digital camera, and couldn't be happier with it.  It was great value compared with other bridge camera and with a name like Fuji, you can be sure of a good brand.  Loads of features and the manual is simple and easy to read.  There is a full manual to supplement the basic one supplied available on the Fuji website.  Great camera at a great price.|#|
8.0|#|The quality of the camera is very good. Very nice holding position. 15x zoom very worth while getting. I would have preferred to get the the S2500HD to be honest.|#|No bag comes with the camera only fault with it....

8.0|#|We purchased a more expensive camera advertised widely on tv but we soon found the images were very disappointing. We looked for a reasonably priced camera that would give us the image quality we had enjoyed with our old camera. We have not been disappointed the images are excellent for myself and wife who are just point and shoot photographers. .|#|The down side is obvious it is the size of the camera it is not a compact you can shove in your pocket.
10.0|#||#|Nothing I can think of.
9.0|#|Very easy to use, but at the same time very powerful.|#|Case is an extra
9.0|#|Really compact and feels like a quality piece of kit. Really pleased with this purchase as it is so easy to use. Menu options are intuitive and easily understood.|#|Only small point is having to remember to open flash. For the occasional photographer it is a little annoying as you tend to adopt a point and shoot approach. This seems to be a feature of fuji finepix cameras. Probably not an issue for more regular users.
9.0|#|fantastic quality for the money, quite easy to use, feels very solid and the video recording is really good!!|#|the only thing I can think that might be a little difficult to use are the manual settings... but with a bit more practice and reading up on the instruction a bit more Im sure it will get easier.

9.0|#|This camera has few rivals in its price range. It has a massive 15:1 zoom and many useful features. The ability to produce HD can produce stunning results.|#|It is not a DSLR so it cannot be expanded by extra lenses etc. The image through the viewfinder could be better.

10.0|#|As you turn the mode dial details of the mode appear on the screen so its very easy to decide what mode to use without having to refer to the instructions, basically a fools guide to perfect prints.|#|Camera arrived without memory card, didn't realise that one was not included and feel it should have been mentioned.
8.0|#|easy to use and good quality especially if you learn all of the different functions|#|need to read book well to learn when to use which features
8.0|#|10 Megapixel and 10x optical zoom (27-270mm) for a moderate price .  Lots of features including image stablisation, face detection, intelligent flash, low light mode etc. Lens quality was very good. Takes standard SD card so you can get hundreds of Foto's on the one card.Can be used automatically or Manually for the more professional photographer. Nice build quality and its size means it will fit easily into your pocket.|#|Slightly difficult to handle. No optical viewfinder which can cause problems in bright sunlight. Mode switch easily moved in pocket.
8.0|#|diiferent options . the main being the ability to take photos in low light without the flash , where four photos are taken and then combined. very impressive results|#|none yet discovered.

10.0|#|The focus and picture quality in EXR mode is excellent for such a small camera. The range of image options is great if you are an experienced photographer but I'm happy to just leave it in the auto modes.|#|None
9.0|#|Excellent image quality if setup correctly - lots of information of the internet.  Small and easy to carry everywhere.  Metal body and generally tough - I dropped mine after just a few days and there was no damage at all.  Great as a second camera.|#|Small and sometimes difficult to hold - the wrist strap is a must.

10.0|#|The Camera is very easy to use and produces very good quality pictures. You can also have control of a lot of the settings yourself. It's best feature is it's ability to take pictures in low light without a flash, which I find extremely useful. I think the camera represents very good value for money and I am generally very pleased with the camera.|#|The battery doesn't last very long before it needs recharging. The only other point is the zoom control, this isn't as easy to control as on some cameras because it often goes past the intermediate setting you want.
9.0|#|So easy to use once you get it on the right setting (read the manual)|#|

10.0|#|Compared to my 2 year old F200EXR the F600EXR focuses much faster, the pictures are sharper and clearer. Picture quality matches DSLRs. The camera does not hunt and make whirring noises in EXR mode as in the F200EXR. It now goes about its business quietly. This model is way improved and is a delight to use. With its light weight serious photographers will consider this in place of heavy DSLRs.|#|None

9.0|#|It's light and very easy to use - most things you can find out for yourself, without going through the booklet.  This compares most favourably to the more expensive Fuji FinePix I had previously, the only difference was that was a more robust camera.|#|I seem to keep putting my finger over the lens, but I think that's just a case of me being more familiar with my last camera and is not really a problem with the camera itself.

9.0|#|I think that this is a great little camera, especially for the money. It powers-on nice and quickly, and is fantastically easy to use. It produces some great, crisp, vivid images, even in relatively poor lighting conditions. The panoramic feature is great fun, and is capable of achieving some impressive results. Video quality is good, also, and all the various other features/shooting modes of the A170 work very well. Battery consumption is very reasonable, even on fairly bog-standard rechargeables. All in all it's a good quality, reliable camera which produces all-round good results. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a generic 'point and shoot'.|#|There aren't any major bad points to the A170, in my experience of it. The quality of pictures taken with the digital zoom aren't the best, it has to be said. But the optical maintains very good clarity, so unless the digital zoom is of great importance to you, this shouldn't be too much of a problem. One slightly irritating factor regards the video capture feature is that if you zoom whilst videoing; it zooms in 'steps'/stages, as opposed to zooming in a single, smooth and steady motion. Again, this isn't a massive problem unless you want a really superb video feature (in which case....by a video camera!). The only two improvements that I feel  could be made to a camera of this nature would be a slightly greater optical zoom, and a slightly more powerful macro feature.

9.0|#|!|#|As it uses AA batteries, if you buy non-rechargeable batteries it will start to become expensive! If you want a camera with an integrated power source, be prepared to stump up more money in the initial purchase. This is cheap because of the standard battery source but as long as you're ok with that, you'll be delighted with the images.

10.0|#|This is simply a very good camera overall. I bought one for my Wife and Daughter who are not photographers so I wanted a camera that would be automatic but also with user input available when needed. This camera fulfilled all their needs and I have found that the qualityof the results are very good. On auto, I was very surprised at the results - the camera handled almost al situations very well indeed.|#|This camera does not really have bad points as far as I am concerned. For the price I don't think you can complain about anything.

5.0|#|Good for using in dark spots, producing excellent pictures.|#|The FinePix disc cannot be installed on Windows Vista, or at least that is my experience. Microsoft do not seem able to fix the problem and the up-date software available from Fujifilm makes no diffderence. This means you cannot download photos which rather defeats the object of the camera for me. It is also a bit small and fiddly.

Enduring battery. Very many nice and well functioning pre-programmed settings making it possible for everyone to do the rights shooting - no matter the condition|#|Has an annoying tick-tick sound when the EXR mode is used due to the constant measuring.

6.0|#|Image quality is without doubt excellent. Looks like classic Leica. Small size makes it less obtrusive than a DSLR making street shots easy. Flash synch's at all shutter speeds.|#|Have been using this solidly for the past 4-5 weeks and for Fuji to say this is a professional photographers camera is fairly wide of the mark. It is simply not good enough for reliable pro use in the field. This is purely down to the unreliable and slow autofocus. In practical terms the camera averages at best at best 60% accurate when autofocussing. This was the same for street and people pics. I actually went back to the shop with the camera as I thought it was a fault, however, the other cameras were the same, proving it is a shortcoming of the camera. The problem lies in the contrast detect system which will often lock onto a background or other area of the scene if there is more contrast in that area. This makes it extremely unreliable for quick shots and the moment is frequently missed. Using manual focus override is nearly impossible in quick reaction situations. It can take 5-10 turns of the adjustment ring to obtain focus. This should be called micro adjust as opposed to real manual focus. The minimum focus distance can frequently cause missed shots. On numerous occasions where you are close to your subject you have to switch to macro mode. To override you have to switch to manual focus then use the rear button focus obtain uninterupted focus. I personally found the the exposure compensation dial too easily knocked resulting in under or over exposed images. At wide open aperture, the max shutter speed is 1000th and the camera will lock up preventing you taking pics in bright conditions. There is however a built in ND filter to help. The battery life is also not the best so make sure you carry a spare to avoid being caught out. If you have time to prefocus your scene and you are not reliant on quick reaction photography then this is an excellent camera that will provide excellent results.

10.0|#|I have never been able to find the camera I wanted to stick with since I got rid of my old canon 35mm which was built well and gave me a feel good factor about my phtography until I got my Fuji x100. Im really enjoying the hands on feel again. So happy that fuji are making something that has so much apeal in a world thats gone touch screen and techno mad. I would say the x100 does exactly what its meant to do and does it well. Not for everyone, but for the right people its perfect. Its what a leica x1 should have been.|#|The only bad thing said about the fuji x100 are said by people that dont own one ;-)

9.0|#|Feels great to use. Hybrid viewfinder is bright, large (like a D3 or 1D) and framelines allow you to compose while seeing outside of the frame, like a rangefinder. Contrary to many, I found the menu intuitive and joy to use; image quality (amazing high ISO performance); in-camera motion panorama capability had opened up new world of possibilities for me.|#|Fixed lens - fixed (pardon the pun) in the new Pro X1; menu toggle pad too small for adult male thumb; wish it had a super-macro mode.
9.0|#|Well built - quality camera which produces the sharpest photographs of any cameras in its class. I have changed from bulky SLRs with expensive Lenses and  I think it can outclass many of them. A super piece of kit which I would well recommend|#|I have only one but nevertheless I am going to buy the X10 another brilliant camera
9.0|#|Superb quality. Innovation with the retro look. Nearly everybody loves this camera! Clients play up to it. They say it is so much nicer to be photographed by this little camera than have a big black SLR thrust at them. The camera upgrades easily to the latest software, a significant upgrade, that, amongst other improvements, makes the camera controls more flexible.|#|Minor issues with controls but maybe I haven't fully read the manual yet! I haven't been able to put a lens hood on as I can't unscrew the ring you nned to remove.
10.0|#|This camera offers the ideal combination of lens and sensor, as the lens  is fixed Fuji have been able to match the sensor and lens perfectly,. The ISO range offers great quality in low light photography.It is a lightweight ,very well built and beautiful looking camera , However this camera is not for a person new to photography   as its use requires some in-depth photography knowledge even though the camera can be used on Auto, but with a camera like this auto would defeat the purpose of using a photographers camera|#|I don't consider this camera having bad points , but if i have to choose one , i would have liked it to have been weather sealed

This was fantastic value for money and very light - didn't even know I was carrying it. So easy to use even I couldn't get it wrong. You pick a certain mode on the dial on the top of the camera and the display screen tells you what it is. In its case it survived torrential rain when my bag was soaked through and the facial recognition worked so well it was picking up faces on t-shirts. Really good value for money and the easiest to use camera I've ever had.|#|The plastic flap which flicks up so you can get the battery in and out is very flimsy and I do worry it will break if I don't take enough care.

Every camera is different so still getting to grips with all the features available on this camera but certainly no complaints from me, does exactly what i want of a camera.|#|None encountered so far.
9.0|#|Best features of a bridge camera combined with the functionality of a DSLR. Feels and works like a  DSLR but is much more versatile switching from wide angle to superzoom in a twist of the zoom ring, absolutely ideal for wildlife shots.The filter thread on the lens enables creative use of extension lenses and filters and the hot shoe enables external flash.The mode dial switches between several pre-set modes instantly so you can shoot landscape or sport or macro at the turn of a dial.The LCD being mounted to swivel up or down enables me to get shots that would be awkward  or impossible with a fixed LCD (get the camera above the crowd or down to low level). The built in guides like the level line mean no more unintended towers of Pisa shots. overall a brilliant camera for the money and the ability to shoot in jpeg or raw format was what put it ahead of either the canon or the nikon bridge cameras for me.|#|I have found the battery door on mine to have a little bit of play so I can feel it move in my hand slightly. moving the command dial to choose a function in some modes requires both button and dial to be operated at the same time needing two hands or more dexterity than I have, it would be better if the button switched the function(ie-multi shots) and stayed enabled till the command dial had chosen which type to shoot. Very minor niggles for such a great camera

9.0|#|Upgraded from a Fuji S602zoom to the HS20, mind boggling difference, Lense range removes the need to carry a mulitude of different lenses.( used to have an old SLR and got fed up changing from wide angle to telephoto, so moved to the S602). Dozens of different setting to chose from especially on selctions SP1 and 2. Before rubbishing this camera, take time to learn it's different settings and options, experiment and take the same shot in different modes, then compare the differences. Takes great low light shots. All in all, a well built multifunctional camera, and well worth every penny I paid. Not tried the Video mode (Not into video) All the negative points mentioned below can be corrected, just practice at it. Remember it is not an SLR camera, so don't try and compare it to one,|#|Low ISO figures will lead to loss of image stability (keep them high 1,600+ if poss), on option selection there is not enough time to read the menu before reverting back to main screen. slight tendancy to over exposure, Auto Focus can struggle in darkened areas.

9.0|#|fairly easy to use, would be super easy if I wanted to take everything on automatic - which I don't. Not cameras fault that I'm still trying to get my head round f stops, ISO's etc.  Batteries seem long lasting, I've been playing with it a lot and still on original set - I'm impressed with that as I was looking for a rechargable camera as I didn't expect normal AA's to last.  As I'm still getting to grips with camera and photo's have varied between being very good and rubbish but that is down to me and camera settings,|#|very limited printed manual. I printed manual off of cd and each page was only a few lines long - ended up with 136 pages when it could easily have been compacted into a third of that. Certainly not something you could carry around with you.  Other than that I can't think of any negative points

9.0|#|It's very easy to use at a basic level - i.e. using the cameras built in systems. It produces excellent quality prints using all levels of zoom from close up macro to maximum zoom. I am only just starting to 'play' with all the other things it can do so cannot really comment on these yet.|#|I haven't yet worked out how to get the movies from the .mov format they leave the camera in to one which can be burned to a disc for use in the dvd player.
10.0|#|I upgraded to this model from my Fuji FinePix S8000fd because I wanted a more powerful zoom. The models are very similar but with obvious improvements: zoom, panoramic shots, horseshoe flash, heavier build. Still has the excellent macro which is why I bought Fuji in the first place.|#|How about it Fuji?
10.0|#|Once you are aware this is not a DSLR and you wont get the image quality of a high end full frame DSLR and you happy with that then go ahead buy it and don't look back. Its great I had the S602 years ago and was happy with that. I am glad that I have now moved onto this one now its everything I expected.

10.0|#|Fantastic value for money and range of features. Click and go or total manual over-ride and control. One thing that does not get mentioned often but which was critical in my decision to buy this camera over its rivals was the fact that it is the only compact in its category that has a thread to allow use of filters. A sunlight filter for protection of the lens and a circular polorized filter are essential in the camera bag.|#|Sometimes a little slow to focus but I have used entry level SLR cameras that are no better. You will have to spend a lot more money to get an improvement. You get what you pay for! Not really a valid criticism but its fantastic range of features means it takes some getting used to. Have never enjoyed video filming so cannot comment here.

There are so many features for those who want a little extra - or fantastic auto modes which produce great results for amateurs.

I was looking for a compact camera to supplemwnt my DSLR and this one had all the features that I wanted. These include image stabiliser system, large zoom and manual control. A good all round mix.|#|Non to speak of
9.0|#|Excellent all in one.  Excellent zoom, great features, great picture quality.  Very quick auto focus, has mechanical image stabilisation and tiltable LCD live-view screen.  EVF is ggod especially in low light.  Bottom line, all the best features of a true DLSR without the fuss of changing the lens.|#|AEL button difficult to turn.  PF has not proved to be an issue, no more than most other cameras.  EVF shows strange colours when panning quickly, but this didnt prove to be too big an issue when I shot photos at Wembley for Eng v USA.

10.0|#|This is my This is my fifth digital camera in ten years. Four have been Fuji and for good reason. I tried one other and pixel-to-pixel they lust did not match up. This camera is at the top of its game. If you are used to Fuji then this one should be just as easy to use. Some of the more advanced features may take a little longer. I was brought up on SLRs and unless you are a professional or perhaps a twitcher it really does render it unnecessary to spend all that money. By the time you have changed the lens, the shot you wanted could be long gone with an SLR. I love the manual zoom, that's important to me. I have used this camera on Moor and coast and cannot praise it enough.|#|I would have liked it to have been powered by AA battery's.
10.0|#|The best of its kind - withou doubt - easy to use even for a novice - I am going to be using mine in an underwater housing for scubadiving photography....|#|None that I have found yet!!
9.0|#|I found the camera very adaptable and easy to use.  I do a lot of close wildlife photography and generally like to take my time with a shot but I occasionally need to work with quite a high speed to avoid missing the moment!    This camera fulfils both needs admirably without the hassle of changing lenses!   It is easy to carry and the body is fairly robust too - always a plus when you're off on hikes in the countryside.|#|I like to shoot in RAW which means that I have to wait quite some time for the information to be processed before I can shoot again.  It can be a bit irksome but then I expect I am the product of an 'instant' age.  It would be great if someone could invent a system that cuts that time!  I worry a bit about the flimsy nature of the cable upload cover and wonder whether it will endure as long as the rest of the camera.

It can handle up to 32Gb cards (not mentioned on Jessops, got gen from Fujifilm). I have 4Gb gives me an hour's video. Sound stays in lip sync with video (a plus point for me as most don't)! I CAN recommend this camera.|#|Lappy.

6.0|#|I bought this for my 10 year old. She is thrilled with it and was instantly able to take some lovely snaps :) - a great first camera in a nice colour. The pictures are clear and punchy, with a good tone to them. Very happy. I espcially like the 'natual light' setting which forces the camera to shoot with available light - and it does a very nice job of it :) . My daughter mostly keeps it on 'auto' mode, but its nice that she has a camera that can grow a little with her! Feels|#|Feels a little flimsy in hand and the on/off button is very easily pressed accidentally. Battery hungry (although I've yet to find a camera that isn't) making rechargeables a must. A case and/or SD card would be nice to be included. The menu system is a little tricky to navigate for a first-timer, but not ridiculously so.Minus points are far out-weighed by pluses!

But its a good little camera and very good value for quick shots.|#|Also didn't realise it didn't come with a memory card and thought my old fuji finepix memory card would fit with this camera also being a fuji finepix, but no it didn't. so I have a redundant memory card now which I think is a bit annoying and surely a design fault from Fuji.

Lightweight and a good looking camera.|#|My personnel opinion is that the picture taking button should be positioned at the front of the camera where the index fingure naturally wants to be. There are many menus available to teh operator but they appear on different button presses / at different times. I believe that it would be better to have a single button / something that all the menus are accesed from so that the occasional user doesn't have to remember under which option a specific menu appears. But generally a very good camera

9.0|#|Incredibly simple to take good quick snaps, but if you want to take your time and create something special you have the features to allow this. The 15x zoom with 5x digital on top is an amazing 75x in total. The camera has a very short shutter lag and rapid sequence is useful too. The stereo full HD video is good quality. The whole experience of taking photos with this camera has reignited my passion for photography.|#|Though the camera is sturdily built the lens cover could have been more substantial. The gps doesn't work too well unless you switch it to on all the time, and doesn't work inside at all. Some people have said the battery life to be short I have found it comparable to other cameras but the problem I had was when it goes it goes and you can't even close the camera (this is a common lith ion problem) Also the battery meter went from full to empty is two or three shots.

9.0|#|The F550EXR feels good to hold, primarily because of the build quality; it feels solid and indestructible (I hope it is).  I have found it very easy to use although I have only really used the EXR mode.  It appears to produce good quality pictures.  This camera has many, many features and is still very compact.  I was happy carrying it around with me on a recent holiday to Spain.  I am delighted with the 15X optical zoom.  I cannot faulty this product really, just a niggle or two.|#|I have not used the GPS function as yet and I believe it does tend to drain the battery rather quickly.  When switching on the unit, the flash pops up and I tend to have my fingers in the way.  I am worried that if I do this too many times, I may do some damage.
10.0|#|absolutely brilliant product, can do everything a bigger expensive slr can do except change lenses for bigger zooms. I bought it for going traveling and wanted something small enough to fit in and out of my pocket but give the best pictures and features possible for this size camera and it more than delivers. So much so that other people in my tour group with bigger cameras are very impressed and one has said he's ditching his bigger camera for one of these as soon as he gets home. I will upgrade in the future to a digital slr but will always have use for a feature packed compact camera like this. highly recommend it.|#|Writing on the dial wheel for selecting shooting setting has worn off very quickly but setting is shown on screen when wheel is turned so no problem really.

In point and click mode it is excellent and easy mode selects enable sport shooting etc.  The weight and size is very acceptable and the stabilisation of images does an excellent job. I use this to supplement my SLR when I don't want to carry an array of lenses, flash etc or just to hacve access to a cheaper camera that I don't have to worry about leaving in car etc. The High Megapixels is ideal for my purposes and the wider ISO range enables all conditions photography.|#|display; slow to write pictures to memory card so sequence shots difficult but typical of this type of camera and budget.

9.0|#|The 30x zoom Lens HD movies mode large clear screen and 10 fps it fits well in your hands it's a large camera but not over heavy|#|The 15 seconds it takes to process the 10 fps, and there is a slight delay when you press the dedicated movie button before it starts to record, no real problem if you are ready to film rather than trying to record on the fly, also trying to zoom while recording makes the image jump, but none of these stop it being a great camera
10.0|#|As for the zoom lens I took  several pics of the Moon the detail is unbelievable for this type of camera at this price|#|Disliked having to print out the instruction manual (massive)
10.0|#|Large monitor screen|#|View-finder a little small.
9.0|#|I bought the camera right before I left for the Canadian Rockies and took the best pictures of my life.  Quality is beautiful and a lot of fun features to play around with.  Worth the money.|#|Eats up alkaline batteries quickly.  I find myself having to spend a lot of batteries.  Panoramic feature requires the photographer to sweep the entire length (about 180 degree arc), instead of allowing the user to choose how long they want the panorama to be.
10.0|#|Amazing 30x zoom, more features than you will ever need, feels like a very professional peice of equipment, very tough as i dropped it from waist height onto concrete and no damage marks and still in perfect condition, huge adjustable lcd screen for viewing shots from virtually any angle, takes AA batteries which is good for days out as you can take spares, always something new to discover, fast to startup and take shots|#|A bit bulky so cumbersome when taking out and about, the slow mo filming has no sound and as the video is the size of a postage stamp in low res its no actual use whatsoever
9.0|#|Battery life is excellent on both disposable and rechargable options, I initialy thought the ommision of a built in rechargable battery was mean but I now see the practicality of having AA batteries - you can buy them anywhere so you will never be stuck with a flat battery pack.|#|No B setting
8.0|#|very good results at low light, low noise even at 30x zoom, excellent panorama pictures, vibrant colours in dinamic image mode, solid pictures overall, movies are sharp.|#|Tricky macro use, manual zooming not smooth, difficult to use manual focus, movies are usable only when shooted with steady camera. Object remover is useless.
10.0|#|The camera is intuitive in use, though this may be because it is not my first digital. It does give superb pictures even at 30X zoom handheld. It is quite light and feels good to handle. I like the twist zoom more than motor driven. I am very pleased with it.|#|I have not got to grips with the Fuji Finepix studio for saving pictues yet, but neither have I spent much time trying. The storage seems less straightforward than it ought to be. The manual focus feature is not as good as I hoped it would be. There is no stop at infinity, you can just keep turning the focus ring. The manual focus was one of the features I wanted so that I could photograph sea scenes and know they would be sharp. (My other camera focuses at about 1 metre when there are not sharp edges for it to lock onto). I think this is a better system but have not really tested it yet.
9.0|#|Point and shoot works great and the manual settings can get great shots as well even in low light conditions.|#|too early to tell yet. Oh you may have to format existing memory cards that are not blank as it will seem to work but you cant find pics as directory structure doesnt match what camera looking for.
10.0|#|does what it says on the box.so easy to use.the thirty times zoom is a big bonus.|#|very heavy on batteries but use reghargables and you seem to get better result.
8.0|#|Dont look at it as a DSLR alternative because its not. but as a compact light weight and v capable travel companion its just brilliant. It also runs on AA batts so you are never gonna be stuck for power on your travels.|#|
10.0|#|everything good on it|#|after a bit got to put it down
9.0|#|Loads of features that are associated with DSLR cameras and good image quality from a smaller sensor.|#|Having been used to a Canon S3IS and the fully rotatable display, I miss it as this camera has limited movement in the display. Having said that, its much a larger and clearer display on this camera and a minor short-coming that I'm hapy to live with.
10.0|#|Easy to use and has a great zoom lense. A great bridge camera|#|No printed user manual.
10.0|#|Love the Zoom lens, and Image quality is pretty good. Not as good as SLR, But close enough for my needs. The controls on the camera are easy to use, with all the important adjustments readily available.  A nice camera for the money. I'm very happy with it. :)|#|A little slow to record images at first, but much better if you go into the menus and turn off all the features you don't really need anyway.
10.0|#|before investing lots of cash in a DSLR and all its expensive kit.|#|The printed manual is quite basic, though the full manual is provided on disc.
10.0|#|Excellent zoom range, easy to get precise zooms due to manual zoom (as opposed to electronic). Excellent settings for automatic modes; picture results from these settings are balanced and very good.|#|Panoramic pictures are very small and make interesting printing! Some settings do use batteries very quickly.
9.0|#|Accessibility of manual settings especially the ability to focus with the aid of a centrally zoomed live image. The 30x optical zoom is hugely significant and when combined with the highly effective image stabilisation this sets the HS10 apart from many other bridge cameras. With a major interest in Natural History this camera is by far and away the best I have owned to date.|#|for the cost, but it's a shame the sensor does'nt provide a higher resolution.
10.0|#|The motion panorama function is so easy to use too - no more messed up panoramics with badly stitched images!|#|No li-ion rechargeable battery system - this is the only improvement I could think of.
10.0|#|Now the HS20 is out the HS10 is great value. If it took great pictures last year it will take great pictures now.|#|Not The Best Sensor so needs allot of light.. However i knew this when i bought it and i Know its not an DSLR
10.0|#|I am going up to Durham next month to photo document that beautiful city  should be able to get any gargoyles on the cathedral with the amazing zoom. I already have taken an angel on our own cathedral here in Cardiff which you can hardly see with the naked eye.I am over the moon with this camera and it has taken me up a notch from a compact one.|#|If it is a bad point the manual zoom takes a bit of practice to get focused and is a bit slow, but this is more about getting used to using it and will get easier with time.For normal photo taking there is the auto option. Oh and a good point of the manual zoom is that it doesn't use up all your battery life.
9.0|#|image quality is good, even in low light and high ISO|#|both these are not serious flaws, just niggles.
9.0|#|Packed full of features, controls are easy to use and software is completely logical and easy to follow. Fabulous lens.|#|feels a bit plasticy, and the twist zoom is a bit coarse at the moment, i think that this may ease wtih use.

10.0|#|The camera is extremely easy to use. Fantastic for my motorsport photography AND more arty photography. It does all that it should and better! I definitely recommend this to anybody!|#|The slow motion quality isn't too good. Perfect FPS but not too clear.
9.0|#|Superb image quality and I can't even BEGIN to tell you about the fantastic quality of the built-in optical 30x zoom, it's the best I've EVER seen and outstanding in a camera of this price range.  I bought this camera because of the amazing optical zoom for a recent African safari holiday and I have to say the pics are amazing, the best I've ever had with a camera of this type, and I've had several of them over the years.  Even in low light, it automatically switches to night mode, and even without a tripod, handheld pics of the moon are clear, bright with no visible shake AT ALL.  Truly amazing.  Plently of 'scene' and manual settings, hot shoe for external flash, tripod mount. I LOVE THIS CAMERA!  BUY IT!|#|The only bad point - and I'm loathe to give it a bad point because it really is such a brilliant camera for the price, it is a 'little' slow to startup and take your first photo - so for fast action shots you need to make sure the camera is already on in order to snap that perfect action pic.  It's also a 'bit' slow to save images between pics. But I'd like to reiterate what a fabulous camera this is - this is really only a minor issue.
9.0|#|The 30x optical zoom provides fantastic macro and micro photos. For a compact camera it is astonishing and I am really please that I didnt go for an SLR which would have cost twice as much to purchase and would probably have offered the same quality and range of functions.|#|Nothing, it is excellent
10.0|#|Never used a complicated camera before - easy to point and shoot. First time use - photos superb|#|Nothing!
9.0|#|Jam Packed with goodies, many of which I am yet to find.  zoom is fantastic - but get a tripod|#|Flash is a bit plasticy, no facility to remote shutter, either via a cord or IR
8.0|#|Excellent picture quality, good automatic settings make taking quality pictures easy for a novice.  Tons of features that would put some SLRs to shame.|#|on the direction selector, making it far too easy to accidentally select the previous photo (left) and then delete.  No way to check battery level - only shows up on display once battery is nearly flat.  Requires 4 AA re-chargeable batteries, which make the camera very heavy to hold.  Fujifilm's RAW image format poorly supported by popular photo editing applications.
9.0|#|Almost everything you might want to adjust is available without having to go into the menu system.|#|No printed manual, it's a PDF file on the CD so no packing it in your camera bag to refer to on your 1st few outings.
10.0|#|Focusing,Exposure,Handling,Lens,Design,auto switch from screen to viewfinder really speeds things up.Best bridge camera yet, and I have owned a few including Olympus and Panasonic plus a Nikon.Overall a brilliant effort by Fuji|#|around this minor irritation and it only affects smooth zooming from one end of the focal length to the other when using the Video function.
7.0|#|Excellent zoom - ideal for wildlife, as long as it's reasonably static.|#|Long shutter lag means the shot you get is not the one you see when you press the button - a problem if the subject is in motion.  Useless for video - although the image quality is good, the screen goes blank for several seconds when you press the record button, meaning that when it starts recording, the subject may have moved out of the viewfinder and you have to pan for it.  Also the operation of the zoom is jerky, and the image stabilisation does not seem to work at all in video mode.  Although only used on one safari holiday so far, already some of the markings on the most used buttons are starting to wear off.  Bought this to replace my much loved Lumix FZ18, but wish now I'd stuck with Lumix.
10.0|#|Great camera, the best camera for taken trips. Plus one nice lens. you can get battery any time you need them, Dont leave home with out one !|#|None so far !

9.0|#|Flexible setting combinations.|#|
9.0|#|So many good points, useful that lens takes filters! Manual focus and zoom|#|Don't like their web site, although you can use this camera straight out the box, it will take you a length of time to master it. knowledge of a film camera is very useful.
9.0|#||#|Battery cover is a bit wobbly and the focus ring is a bit slow when focusing. Other than that it is a very good purchase!
9.0|#|The camera is easy to use even and for a someone new within the field of photography. It does everything I want it to doand more. Would highly recommend this the Fuji Finepix HS10|#|None

9.0|#|Buy this camera if you want to bridge between the compact digitals and dslrs and take some fantastic shots.|#|
10.0|#|Compact super sized zoom. Excellent bridge camera. Good build quality and great photos.|#|I guess reviews that criticise the camera come more from those that haven't read the manual or who expect it to be a DSLR.
10.0|#|This is my first zoom camera.  Lots of settings - most of which I doubt I'll ever use.  I just wanted a point and go camera with a zoom powerful enough to get up close to wildlife.  This does the job.  Images very clear.|#|None

8.0|#|Good build quality. Good picture quality.|#|Not as good as my Lumix FZ-38 so I returned it for a refund. I was disappointed in the spot focusing and exposure settings (not as good as the Lumix for small distant objects (wildlife)). The automatic switch between LCD and EVF doesn't work well if you wear glasses and the evf hasn't got enough eye relief for specs wearers either. It's very big and heavy compared with the Lumix. Battery life is short. Manual zoom is nice but very hard to use in video mode without waving the camera about! All in all, its good but the Lumix FZ-38 is better.
9.0|#|zoom, lcd screen size and the fact you can angle it, this camera will do just about everything an amateur photographer could want to do , inc short hd movies, high speed shooting  and multi-frame pictures, panorama, macro and super macro shots the list is endless + excellent battery life, I used batteries for a reasonable length of time that were exhausted according to my old canon compact camera and that wouldn't even turn it on!!! buy it, you wont be disappointed|#|Camera strap too long for me even at its shortest. could do with a compact paper copy of the complete manual to carry around for beginners like me, the basic is too basic and the complete manual is just on disc.  Nothing else though!!
9.0|#|tilting LCD screen gives easier viewing and composing. Manual focus is assisted by a 'zoom', enabling pin-sharp focusing. At full extension, the 30X optical zoom does need a tripod to eliminate camera shake, but the craters on the moon really are awesome! Shutter delay is there, but only slight- a little practise should soon sort that out. To get the best out of this camera, PLEASE READ THE MANUAL! It is all there!|#|No remote shutter release, but the self-timer gives enough time for things to settle at high zoom. No pre-printed manual- PDF on disk makes bedtime reading awkward!  Fuji software took an age to load (several updates from Microsoft needed for my computer - thanks for that  (:-( ), and seemed a bit flaky at the end of it all. (no bother to me- I use Paint Shop Pro to view and print) - could just be me being stupid, though there have been one or two similar comments on the Fuji forum website.
9.0|#|better on the hs10,buy it.|#|no cable shutter release.
10.0|#|Lot of photographic features.|#|Low resolution EVF.
9.0|#|Manual zoom allows precise framing very quickly compared to powered zooms.  Panoramic function is very good for city views.|#|Panoramic function is sensitive to speed that camera is turned and took a bit of getting used to.
9.0|#|All in all I think it's going to do a Lovely job especially for a Travelling Vagabond like myself :)|#|Only downside that Ive experienced is the batteries, even though I have got 2300 for it, he seems to not take kindly to them so i shall keep trying others until there is a marriage :)
10.0|#|The camera has loads of features which are good for that all important shot the tilt lcd screen is an excellent feature too and with that all important 30x zoom lens.The next feature is panoramic setting finally no more linning up the next shot just press sweep and its all done for you but there are so many things this camera can do its by far the best bridge camera I've bought yet.|#|To be honest the only thing I can think off is the fact that the lens is not a fully auto zoom lens but hey you can't have it all :~))
9.0|#|great camera i use it for taking bmxing pictures it works great and is easy to use with the high speed image capturing. i would recomend this to any one who wants a cheep bridge DSLR that has alot of great points.|#|have not found any bad points yet.

The Fuji HS10 is a very sturdy camera and shoots in full HD Format. The zoom capacity is absolutely awesome! Good job I'm not a pervert! lol The camera has come in handy for my current college course (Diploma in Creative and Media).|#|2. The manual focas. The focus ring goes on forever.

The focus rubber wheel is a big mistake, as it colects bits of muck and dust far to easly, makes camra look dirty. should have been made of plastic. flash get in the way of focus wheel. Battery compartment is much to flimsy, and tricky to close. HD features are waist of time, i expected much sharper quality play back. A DX memory card would have been a nice extra.

9.0|#|Nice looking camera, small but not inhibited from taking good photos. Value for money very good especially in these times. I'm not an expert at taking photos but this is easy to use and gives me expert pictures. Would recommend to my friends.|#|All camera's should come with a case included, to protect it. You should not have to buy one separately. The cost could be included in the cost for the camera. Its like a kettle without a plug !!

5.0|#|The camera is Light-weight and compact, so easy to fit inside a pocket or bumbag. For the features the camera is reasonably well-priced.|#|Quality of photos in low light is poor with and without flash, and I am experiencing far too many blurred photos generally for a camera of this specification. Again I suspect the camera is faulty and am waiting for a reply from the retailer as to whether they are happy to replace my camera.
9.0|#|Small and compact, like a spy camera.|#|The buttons are a bit fiddley,  to the point you have to focus an image by pressing down the shutter button half away.

10.0|#|I bought the camera for my granddaughter, for her 9Th birthday, and she loves it. With in Min's she was using the video feature, making a video of her birthday with commentary. What I am trying to say is it was so easy to use, she was able to get good results straight away. I have a more expensive Olympus and I thought the camera was great and would not mind one myself, except in blue!|#|None, except I wont one!
9.0|#|Bought this camera as a 6th birthday present for my grandson. He loves it . it is easy to use and he took loads of lovely photos at Disney World in Florida recently. It has stood up to the bumps and bangs a six year old gives it. a very good package for what we wanted.|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use, excellent photos, excellent value.|#|Only drawback I have found was trying to use the screen to frame a shot in bright sunlight. It was rather difficult to see what I was taking due to glare of the sun on the screen, and an'old fashioned' view finder would have been helpful. I suppose this may be common to many modern cameras though?

She navigated the buttons easily and it is compact enough for her to tote around in her bag.|#|Would have like a case to accompany it and had a bit of trouble stitching pictures. Also only had room for 3 pictures on internal memory. You definately need to have a memory card inserted at all times

10.0|#|Perfect little camera to leave in handbag ready for use.  I am a bit of a technophob but this camera is so simple to use that even i can do it.  Easy to change from photo to movie mode and the quality of both is very good. It has lots of different shooting modes but i just leave it on 'Auto' the whole time and get perfect photos each time.   Very good value for money and it looks great too.|#|

10.0|#|This is a good item, easy to use, quality images and all round excellent vaue.|#|
6.0|#|The image quality is superb, you couldn't ask for better. The HD video is also impressive and both photo an video are easily viewable on the large, clear screen.|#|The Build quality is poor, the body is very chunky and made out of plastic. The thing that lets the camera down most though has to be the ease of use, or lack of it the menus are hard to navigate and there is no button to go from photo to video. Also it only takes AA Batteries this is annoying as you constantly have to buy batteries as the camera consumes a lot of power. You could buy rechargable ones but they last no where near as long as the proper rechargeable NI-MH Batteries. It just seems stupid that a good value for money camera like this is let down by little things like this that eventually get very frustrating.
10.0|#|Great Camera easy to use good pictures.|#|None
9.0|#|Very easy to use, and good picture quality, cheap price for the quality.|#|Hard to criticise but a viewfinder would be useful.
9.0|#|Great low light capability|#|Can't adjust zoom whilst taking video (you can set the zoom prior to starting though)
9.0|#|This has got to be the ultimate point and go camera. Whilst the very ISO settings suffer from a little background noise, the cameras ability to take pictures in natural light is unbeatable. The intelligent flash actually seems to deliver what it promises, with vastly reduced white outs. Whats great though is you do not need to decide which of these two settings to use as one of the settings on the camera will take both with a single push of the shutter button. Review and decide which one to keep (or keep both). Face detection seems a bit of a joke but again seems to deliver in most circumstances. Good range of manual settings that are really quite easy to access. I have four other digital cameras (2xfuji, 1xCanon,1xNikon)this camera goes almost goes everywhere with me. Only 1 of the other Fuji's (S602) gets used on a regular basis, much (much) larger and similar resolution, but superb lens can deliver much better results in good lighting. The colour balance of all the other cameras (for me) is off the mark (to blue). Excellent display that can be seen in most bright light situations (hooray). Quick to power up and very quick to take picture after pushing shutter button. Battery life remarkable. Very very pleased.|#|Connectors very small, with silly plastic cover.
9.0|#|An excellent camera|#|Lack of viewfinder

9.0|#|Great pictures, 3200ASA works well and gives more options, easy to use, and can be left on Auto if you dont want to mess around - a first class buy at the price|#|The top options wheel is prone to being stiff if any dust gets on it, and only XD cards (changed on a later model I believe) limits the choice and are more a little more expensive but otherwise its fine.

9.0|#|Took some super pics of lions elephants etc on safari. Trouble is I now have hundreds of pics.|#|No viewer makes it difficult to photograph things such as whales and the instruction book is like a novel, has anyone ever read it? An abreviated guide listing all features and rapid way to get them would be useful

10.0|#|THE IMAGE QUALITY IS THE BEST I'VE SEEN IN ANY DIGITAL CAMERA|#|I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY BAD POINTS
10.0|#|Camera is first class|#|The Fine Pix software is rubbish, it did not help me at all, own software better
9.0|#|very easy to use,light weight,easy to follow instructions.|#|it would be helpful if the camera came with a lightweight case that the camera fitted into correctly.
9.0|#|Compact, easy to use, inexpensive to purchase and operate|#|Sometimes - just sometimes - I feel the need for a viewfinder (which the A900 doesn't have), but that is fairly rare!
9.0|#|easy to use, light and good value for money|#|no case to protect the camera
10.0|#|The camera is easy to learn and use, quality of pictures very good, and I'm very happy with it|#|
9.0|#|Very easy to use, good quality photos. Takes pictures quickly, important for what I need it for.|#|Battery does run down quickly if you have it set to GPS always on.
10.0|#|Bought for my 10 year old- easy to use, good quality pics|#|
9.0|#|Point and squirt, that's just what I wanted and that's just what I got.  Filming...just press the red button to start and press it again to stop.  Looks funky in orange too.  All instructions in the areas you want are all on screen so a great camera with robust use for me and the hubby when he goes kayaking, great|#|
10.0|#|Really easu to take standard photos.  Great for water images and even movies under water|#|User booklet showing the parts of the camera would have helped.  Needed more detail on closing the battery section to ensure it is water tight
9.0|#|Simple to use. Good quality pics. Good value|#|Battery cover is a bit flimsy and could spring open when underwater which would spell disaster
3.0|#|Does seem sto be water proof and dust proof as it has been on use on beach holiday and still works.|#|Overall not very impressed and wouldn't recomend you buying it.
10.0|#|The range of programme modes. The small size for a waterproof camera. The ergonomic design. The ability to control flash use. Fantastic camera for its class. I usually use a SLR camera but this is has enough features to not make me frustrated. Buy one for yourself!|#|Really need a second battery though recharge times on the battery is quick. 3200 iso whilst excellent to have gives expectedly grainy results. Gps whilst brilliant needs to be switched off if signal not available as will drain battery on constant search.
8.0|#|Durable, waterproof and shockproof GPS locator|#|maual on cd bit tricky to set up
7.0|#|Waterproof, drop proof and dust proof.|#|No viewfinder.
9.0|#|excellent pictures in or out of the water, I bought this so I can record my daughters Kayaking and its fantastic|#|
9.0|#|Great tough compact. Bought it for my daughter, we wanted a good solid waterproof camera (her last one ended up in a stream on a school geography trip.... ahhhh)|#|None really, however just check the door is closed correctly (before you take it underwater). Make sure the little latch 'clicks' into place.
9.0|#|The GPS feature on this is excellent and the panaramic shoot mode allows to create some amazing photos.  The underwater shots are also very good and the camera has excellent HD filming|#|Takes a long time for the GPS to track you just like when you start up a sat nav, you can place the camera to constantly track even when off but it does eat the battery, if you do a lot of photos might be worth while getting a second battery.
10.0|#|Very good value for money and uses a popular memory card.|#|Quite heavy but necessary I guess for the features. I would prefer to have a view finder, hard to see what you are focusing on in bright sunlight.
9.0|#|great camera easy to use ,tough and takes great underwater shots whilst in pool on my holidays!|#|

8.0|#|Sale item so got for a good price.  Seems pretty solid and feels good in hand|#|Probably not the sharpest pictures but for the money and type of camera......
9.0|#|Great in the sea, watch out there are two underwater modes! Make sure you get the right one. Make sure you securely lock the battery/ SD card cover and rinse with tap water after use in sea water.|#|Although two auto modes, there are a lot of other modes, so can take a little time to activate the correct mode. Didn't,T put the GPS on as other said this takes a lot of time and uses up the battery power.

9.0|#|Very sexy, compact and easy to use.|#|would be easier to have a cradle to put the camera in to charge and connect to the PC because you have to remove the battery and plug it into a charger each time.
9.0|#|images are very clear and the design is very nice, easy to use.|#|has red eye reduction, so have put it on that setting but sometimes the pictures still come out with red eyes, this only tends to happen when its night.
10.0|#|I love this little camera!  I don't have anything bad to say about it.  I love the black and white feature, the delay when you take the picture isn't too bad, unlike my last camera where it took about 20 seconds.  I bought the case that goes with it too, which is so small and cute and briliant to put into a little handbag when out on the town!!|#|
10.0|#|The capture time is fast so you aren't waiting around to take a picture.|#|

8.0|#|Small compact and easy to use|#|Could be easier to insert usb without openning battery case
8.0|#|Great Design, easy to use out of the box, reasonable battery life, it only has one button on the top!! Face recognition works much better than I have seen on other Fuji cameras, but still could be better in low light.|#|Strange button configuration takes a little getting used to, but is fine in the end. The charger is a strange shape (OK, so I am scraping the barrel here). I am still waiting to see a camera that can auto rotate my pictures.
10.0|#|and its easy to use and the main thing thaT ATTRACTED ME IS THAT IT IS RECHARGEABLE AND CAN TAKEA LOT OF PHOTOS BEFORE A RECHARGE MY LAST CAMERA ONLT TOOK 4 PHOTOS AND THEN NEEDED NEW BATTERIES|#|
9.0|#|Compact, beautiful, easy to use|#|Comes without a case and without a card - standard, but means it will get scratched easily.
9.0|#|Compact to carry around. No chance of taking accidental pictures. Reproduction of images excellent.|#|I still found it easier to use my old camera for quick snaps and my Fuji for pictures where I wanted a good focus.
9.0|#|Easy to use, compact and sylish.|#|Concerned about the slightly protuding screen and think that if dropped even once then it would smash and ruin the camera. But I hope I don't ever find out!

10.0|#|Surprised at how light the camera feels. Image quality is very good and SR Auto means you just point and shoot, but 50x zoom is most impressive.|#|
10.0|#|Light.Easy to use has everything I need from a camera.Could not believe the price. Great value|#|None that I have found
10.0|#|All good at the moment considering the short while I have had the camera but I can  find no faults at the moment which would cause me any concern.Well pleased so far and would recommend at this stage.|#|Would prefer a more detailed instruction manual in hard copy format rather than searching the computer for small details particularly if you are away from home and need to consult the manual for instructions.
7.0|#|so far it easy to use in genera lmode,but have not got to grip with some of the features yet,not had the camera long,so early days.|#|found that when udeing the screen,it goes off,and obviosly the view finder comes into use must be a way of leaving one on or of,bit irritating?,

9.0|#|everything is ok|#|no bad points
9.0|#|Well thought out design ,fantastic manual zoom no waiting for it to hunt for focus on some subjects. In short an excellent bridge camera with a very wide range of settings. Almost foolproof !!. As a retired Staff Press photographer who got fed up with lugging about a large bag of gear I would recomend this as the best finepix so far.|#|none yet.
10.0|#|Great bridge camera,top quality lens, long zoom,w i d e angle,love the manual zoom lens,saves battery life .so many features it's gonna take a fair bit of practice to get used to.Thought of buying entry level SLR but the HS30 EXR has much the same features without buying seperate lens.also not experienced enough for SLR yet.and it was much cheaper.going to venice in a month so should be quite proficient by then, can't wait.|#|can't say iv'e found any yet. Would recomend a image screen protector,i never got one and now wish i had.
9.0|#|Beautiful camera with lots of features, sharp picture quality. There are plenty of functions to experiment with. I am so looking forward to taking my new camera on holiday next month. Like it.|#|Not as easy to navigate through all the settings but its early days yet.
10.0|#|Easy to use, packed full of features, has the ability to attach screw on filters. I purchased this to replace a digital slr and I have never looked back. Excellent|#|None found
9.0|#|Solid build and good controls, viewfinder streets ahead of other Bridge cameras except XS-1. Delivered good photos for hours on end at a wedding - occasional backlit or difficult contrast fooled meter but very good results overall.|#|Bit prone to over expose, and sometimes slow to focus at long zoom settings.
9.0|#|great features|#|quite hard to focus on full zoom
10.0|#|So far very satisfying.....|#|To be fair this problem is a problem on many makes of DSLR-Bridge-and Superzoom Cameras.
10.0|#|before i bought this camera i just had a small compact camera but felt like i wanted to upgrade to something bigger and more advanced but didnt want to pay dslr prices so this bridge camera seemed the best way to go with it being inbetween a compact and dslr iam very happy i bought this make and model it has lots of settings and is easy to use but also gives you settings to learn and advance on your photography the more you use it the more you learn and picture quality is amazing|#|had the camera for about two months and cant find any bad points at all
10.0|#|This has a long life on each battery charge which considering the price is good.  Also being a Canon pro user this was the best choice of an all in one camera to backup my pro kit or for days when I cannot risk my expensive kit being damaged in airports or on location|#|cost of batteries when needing extra's £50+ each and you will need at least a spare.
8.0|#|Good price online offer , fairly prompt delivery , i think photos are great not used all functions but seems straight forward to use with cd manual vid great , zoom brill , over all nice to use love it|#|not found any major probs yet
10.0|#|If you have never used a camera before it may be a bit tricky, but practise makes perfect.|#|No bad points that I can see, but I am not a professional and I am extremely happy with this camera.

5.0|#|Lovely design, lots of useful features and the camera build quality appears high. The camera responded very quickly to adjustments, focused quickly and there was no discernible shutter lag.|#|The picture quality on all setting was basically poor. The colours were good but the pictures were really grainy, even outdoors on a sunny day. My camera also had a fault - the bottom right hand corner was always out of focus, affecting about 20% of the photo. It was like the lenses were out of alignment and not focussing on the whole area.

9.0|#|Overall it's a great little camera.   Fabulous for popping in your handbag or pocket. Loads of good features....|#|The Flash!  A real let down....  It pops up underneath your left hand index finger!  Really annoying!  Why couldn't they have positioned it somewhere else?  Other than that no prob....
10.0|#|Small camera with loads of features; I haven't got the chance to use all of them yet...the zoom and image quality are great, it recognizes faces, panoramic shooting, good quality flash, stabilises pictures, good for taking pics of moving objects such as babies like ours! :)|#|You forget the flash popping up sometimes but no biggie!
10.0|#|Nice and small/compact|#|the only bad point is I must remember to move my finger when I switch the 'on' button, as the flash 'box' pops up where I am holding the camera

10.0|#||#|design could have been thought out a bit more as the Flash pops up under your Left index finger, but not a Massive gripe for me but other people have said about this, Fujifilm, should have thought out the Design a bit better

10.0|#|easy to use and so far nothing bad to say.|#|
9.0|#||#|Only other complaint is the battery indicator gives little advance warning of a dead battery - a couple of spares have resolved this .
9.0|#|Zoom works well though when I have compared to Panasonic with lower zoom it wasn't any greater. Panoramic feature is excellent as is quality of the screen. Camera feels like it is well made|#|Flash always pops up which is slightly annoying, it doesn't come with SD card but these can be purchased cheaply from other sites. Strap doesn't come with a handy tightener which is surprisingly annoying as camera feels like it will come off your wrist.

So easy to use and very compact and takes brilliant photos.|#|only negative thing i can say about this camera is where the flash pops up from- its where your left hand naturally holds the camera- once you get used to it, its ok.
9.0|#|Nice compact size for such a good camera, it fits nicely into my handbag. It is very easy to use and the picture quality is so good. Excellent zoom which is one of the reasons I bought it.|#|Pop up flash is not in the best position but you do get used to it. Otherwise no other bad points.
8.0|#||#|Fan type lens cover is very delicate, the first one broke and had to replace the camera, now paranoid about breaking this one.
8.0|#|Really good easy to use camera with lots of manual settings.|#|Dont get a paper copy of manual. But most goods are the same nowa days
3.0|#||#|Face recondition failed within 4 weeks of puchase and image quality inferior to my cheaper Sony camera.
8.0|#|Good build quality. The flash poping up is not a problem to me as you become use to it. You need to read the online manual to fully understand the camera. I think for this price it should have a few more features as some cheaper cameras do have more. Overall it a good camera but you do need to practice alot for good results.|#|Popup flash will be a nuisance to some people.
9.0|#|Compact, light, large screen, zoom, picture quality across a range of light intensities. I used it for the first time at a wedding to capture unguarded shots of guests and activities and the beautiful landscape surroundings. From high intensity midday sun through to evening, the shots all came out beautifully exposed and colourful.|#|No paper manual. The CD corrupted my printer settings when I tried to print the instruction manual. Instruction manuals on CD involve hidden costs for the purchaser - ink, paper, time and potential problems! Also no soft case included.
9.0|#|Replacement batteries (NP-50) are good value too.|#|Quite a few reviews criticize the flash popping up (and staying up), but you soon get used to that.
9.0|#|very handy and great quality. didn't use all the features yet bur definitely good value camera.|#|just one thing when you switch on the flash will come out bit awkward because you will keep holding in that side. but not really a problem when you're use to it.
8.0|#|Good sturdy build with quality finish and great looking.|#|Watch your fingers don't get in the way when the flash pops up.
10.0|#|an all round, easy to use, great picture quality camera. 15 x zoom is superb. everyone who has seen camera have commented on what a great looking camera it is.|#|the pop up flash could get damaged easily if you're not careful.
9.0|#|The options are great, you can point and shoot or pick the function you want. The panorama option is amazing, I've used it so much in various squares in Europe for example Grand Place in Brussels. It may seem a bit daunting at first with all the options but just take your time and play with it.|#|The flash that pops up as soon as you switch on the camera needs getting used to.
8.0|#|This one is very easy to use|#|
10.0|#|great camera,good quality pics.|#|the only minus is flash,because it pops out on top of left corner

10.0|#|Easy to use and takes perfect photos.  Lots of features that can be used easily and give high performance.|#|Very minor point, the flash pops up which is a little out of place for such a compact camera
8.0|#||#|The flash is not ifully ntegrated in the camera body, it pops up and prevents you holding the camera at each coerner when taking shot. This mas that holdng he camera stableis not as easy s a acmea with afully interated flash that dos not pop up.

9.0|#|Not too small nor too large comfortable fit within your hand|#|
9.0|#|Very compact, well built, good zoom range and lots of features if you like to do your own set up but not complicated.|#|Colour a bit washed out on full auto setting but can be improved by adjusting settings.
10.0|#|Professional or amateur, this camera is made for both. Use auto function, or manual if you're more photo savvy.|#|I haven't found any yet.
9.0|#|great camera for the amateur with good range of features|#|when camera turns itself off to conserve energy you have to reset some features eg.continuous shooting

10.0|#|A great and very easy to use camera in auto mode but also lets you set manual if you desire. Fantastic picture quality compared to my old casio.|#|As others have said the flash is in a bit of a daft place as it pops up under your finger until you get use to it.
9.0|#|Looks really good in black.  Nice array of features to suit both the novice and the more experienced photographer. Nice picture quality.|#|Battery doesn't last more than 200 pics.  Best buy a spare battery and keep it with you to swap over when needed.  Flash can be a little annoying as it pops up just where you would normally put your left hand.  You do get used to it though and learn to hold the camera to avoid the flash.
6.0|#|Features, build quality are good.|#|Poor low light.  Not able to get consistently good results.  It's abit of hit and miss.  A bit frustrating.
10.0|#|Quite an amazing Zoom lens - very sharp through out its range. The EXR system is quite spectacular - it is as good any budget SLR as a comprehensive  all round camera.  A bonus - the fixed lens also prevents dust on the sensor|#|View finder typical electronic type - but probably the best one I have used
10.0|#|Good lens. Fast processor. Print quality. Good weight and balance. Careful design and attention to detail|#|LCD too small. Electronic viewfinder OK, but the image quality looks like a compromise. (A similar electronic viewfinder on the Fujifilm S9500 was excellent.) The display of an image when shooting through the viewfinder appears on the viewfinder, not the LCD, which is annoying. HOWEVER, you can get used to all these, and they are more than balanced by the other qualities.
9.0|#|The Fuji S200 EXR is a very well specified and versitile camera which makes use of Fuji's advanced sensor design and firmware to produce a camera that is capable of capturing detail not only in the ordinary situations but in difficult situations where it would be impossible otherwise to get the quality of image you want. It captures images at up to 12 megapixels, has a 14x zoom and an ISIO range up to 12800. It is well-built without being heavy or as bulky as a pro-DSLR. It's EXR dunctions as very useful.|#|It can't take 12Mp images at its fastest continuous shooting speeds.
10.0|#|EXR sensor - Image quality and features are superb.  I have been using a Nikon D1 for the last 10 years and this produces comparable if not better images.  Not been able to check the RAW files yet, but the jpegs are truly super.|#|It sounds naff, but I have found no bad points about the camera, but ......  No Raw conversion software available, even now, a couple of months after product launch - big oversight on the part of Fuji!!
9.0|#|I wanted a camera that was compact but has functions of DSLR, also manual focus was the important part. Difference between this camera and DSLR is that the lens doesn't come off. It has pretty much every function of DSLR. Manual focus is a great option, and being able to attach any filter I want is also a great option. Having the big 67mm lens is great for taking crisp good quality photos. I worried that there will be battery drain but I can shoot about 300 photos until I need to recharge.|#|It's as big as DSLR and quite heavy. It doesn't have option to attach cable release...
9.0|#|Fairly easy to use, I have not yet worked out all the features|#|Paper instruction manual not very good. Flipping back and forth with the CD ROM version can be a pain.
10.0|#|Excellent all round but for the below|#|No lens hood, no cable release socket
9.0|#|Excellent lens  - both zoom and close-up detail is outstanding. Viewfinder is brighter, clearer, better  than previous Fuji bridge cameras I have had (s6500fd and s9600).  Minimal shutter lag. Am still learning how to use - there are so many options.|#|Quite heavy. Feels a bit cumbersome in the hand. No printed owner handbook (CD pdf only) . Some options e.g. SP Mode fiddly to use.
9.0|#|I bought this so called bridge camera because I do not like lugging lots of lenses around. past experience of this type of camera has been very satisfactory. Picture quality from the s200exr is excellent and with a little tweaking in Photoshop Elements tremendous {the same can be said of most cameras} Features such as the vast array of shooting modes are a big improvement on my previous fujifilm  camera, which I considered to be more than adequate.The inclusion of image stabilisation copes well with the long  lens. I am very satisfied with my purchase.|#|Strap fixing, although secure, does not inspier confidence.
10.0|#|The zoom on it is also incredible, been shocked by how crisp and clear results even the digitial zoom has! So glad I bought it, great camera, perfect for amateurs|#|The weight can make the taking a picture a bit shaky, but the result has no result of this
10.0|#|Very good picture quality, and with very little photographic experience, it makes me look like I know what i'm doing!|#|None found yet

10.0|#|Good image quality if you adjust lightning. Portraits very good, other pictures need a staddy hand, then also good! Fun making pictures!!|#|Snapshot in difficult lightning without using flah
8.0|#|This is a  very  sophisticated  camera  with  many  cutting-edge  features.....and  would  have  been  perfect  were  it  not  for  one  major  problem.....|#|The  camera  emits a  continuous noise  rather  like a  fan. Apparently  it is  the image  stabilisation mechanism  which operates  constantly. I had  assumed  that  it  could  be  switched  to only  operate  when a  picture  is  being  taken  but  having  researched  quite  extensively on  the  internet I  found  that  nobody  has  managed  to  stop it  making this  noise. For  the  occasional  photo it  would  not  be a  problem....but if, like me,  you  keep the  camera  on permanently ( and  in  often  quiet  surroundings)  for  wildlife  photography,  the  noise  was  both infuriating  and an unhelpful constant companion.
9.0|#|Excellent price|#|To wake up from sleep you have to turn the camera off for a second then turn it back on - most other SLR type cameras will wake from any button
10.0|#|features to get the pictures I want. Superb!|#|

9.0|#|As near as you can get to a SLR. It is a large camera but I like this as the controls are less fiddly and it feels right. Will report back later on the results and performance|#|None
9.0|#|Lush camera. Sturdy design. So many different features means I pretty much dont need any additional lenses or filters at it is all editable afterwards in photoshop.|#|Flash does not travel too far so would advise on additional flash gun if doing photos of crowds at night during weddings etc.
9.0|#|good point is image quality and features|#|lack of auto rotate
10.0|#|Fantastic camera for the money|#|None that  I can see
10.0|#|very easy to use ,a long battery life ,a quality produced|#|no bad points
9.0|#|I bought this as an upgrade to my Fuji FS6500 as it offers 12Mpix (over 6 - better for cropping) improved noise at low light levels, and Optical Image Stabilisation. So far I am happy with all three 'improvements'. In the hand it feels very much like the FS6500 which means I forget I am using a new camera and 'go for' the wrong button!|#|It is bigger and a little heavier than the FS6500, and wide angle end of the zoom is not as wide at 30.5mm (v 28mm) 25m equiv.
7.0|#|Easy to use, but still learning; many features identical to earlier models, so very familiar if you've had a Fuji before|#|Disappointed with build quality; feels very plastic!  full instructions only available on supplied CD

10.0|#|Simple, easy to use and fantastic quality pictures.  Excellent value for money.  Bought it for my wife who wanted an easy to use camera that could fit into her handbag!  Not only does it do that but it's proved to be a great camera for those spontaneous moments that are now captured because the camera is always with us!|#|She won't let me use it!!
8.0|#|Stylish. User friendly with loads of option including infrared connection so do not to use cables at all.|#|Pictures not as good as expected. Prefer my T7. Bought the item because it has IS0 1600 so I thought night time pictures would be better than my old sony but not much difference.

8.0|#|Easy to use, brilliant present for the girlfriend whos not very tech wise.|#|Wen in a hand bag the front sides open and turns the camera on without user knowing and runs the battery down and yo don't realize till you come to take a picture.
7.0|#|Size, body colour options, ease of use, dual-format memory capability xD and SD + a good deal when bought with 1GB SD card and leather case.|#|Flimsy feeling
9.0|#|A very decent little camera. The image quality is very good, and there are loads of different settings for taking photos. It takes nice movies too. It feels good to hold, fits very nicely in your hand and is not too big. Highly recommended!|#|Some settings are a little difficult to find. Switching between still photo and movie mode is not as easy as it could be (just takes a few more button presses than would be ideal).

9.0|#|Ease of use, pretty, funky, sleek, feels nice-bought for teenage daughter so the pink went down well. Large screen, haven't used all the features as yet.|#|Have to purchase memory disc as additional as internal memory only holds about 35 pics; shame battery has to be removed to charge although this could be seen as a plus if you buy addition battery

9.0|#|easy to use|#|none
10.0|#|I love this camera.   I live in a beautifully scenic resort town on the Red Sea Coast so carry my camera everywhere and take photos all the time.   The zoom is amazing and I hardly ever need to use the tripod.   Good choice of special scene selections including cats and smooth face shots!|#|Haven't quite figured out the Fuji Software for managing photos on the laptop so just use the software already installed.
8.0|#|Good  optical zoom range|#|I would rather the flash  have to be activated rather than it automatically activating when you turn the camera on even though you can push it back down easily enough.
9.0|#|Nice to handle and the LCD screen is also nice, panorama feature a nice extra,image quality is really good if you get a good camera but lens quality does vary an awful lot with these so be aware to try the actual model you buy. at the top end of the zoom image is really good but the camera takes some holding steady,battery life has been excellent,I tried all the other travel/long compact zoom cameras and this came out the best on all my tests.|#|Long time to zoom after taking a shot,hard to hold steady at top end of zoom range...but that goes for all these cameras with a 12x plus zoom...NO Viewfinder....big mistake with all these new compact super zooms,of course it adds to the price which is why the makers don't put it in now. Don't expect DSLR quality
8.0|#|Being able to set the photo size to 16:9 as standard is also a good feature - especially as I now only view photos in a 16:9 format.|#|Doesn't come with a camera case. For the price, a simple leather pocket to keep it in would have been nice.
9.0|#|Good automatic settings|#|The popup flash although if i think i won't be using the flash i hold my finger over it when turning on, then it doesn't pop up.
8.0|#|Top class camera, bought it just before going on holidays and the pics and pics are looking great. An investment worth purchasing.|#|My night landscape snaps were not clear so i guess they can improve on night landscape picture capture.

10.0|#|Great quality images, relatively easy to use with some superb features|#|Taking some getting used to for shooting at night as, no matter what setting I have it on, images often appear dark even with 'forced flash'...probably need to read up on it a little more but I received it just before I left to go on holiday so didn't really have chance to practice much with it
7.0|#|Numerous features though automatic, long lasting battery, Very beautiful images if well understood and held firmly, good hd video.|#|very very very fragile camera, need few seconds to focus (speaking from reality, used it  my event and 10% of pictures were blurred due to overcrowded venue. Camera didn't come with hdmi cable and has very small usb cable. Manual poorly explained the camera settings, didn't come with memory card.

1.0|#|Didnt have time to check for good points as the camera was faulty when i received it|#|Camera was faulty when i received it. Would only take a few photographs and then the camera would freeze. The only way to get camera to work again was by removin the battery.
9.0|#|Great little camera.    Excellent H.D video mode is a bonus - better than my 4 year old dedicated video camera.|#|Found initial Setting up a bit time consuming even for the EXR and AUTO modes. However once done everything was great.

10.0|#|- Panoramic shots are good|#|- The panoramic mode sometimes loses its point of reference for aligning the second or third shot, but i have experienced the same issue with Fuji's bridge cameras
10.0|#|There are other excellent features and settings and I can't recommend this new Fuji camera highly enough! 10/10|#|I haven't seen any bad points yet!
9.0|#|Easy to use and reasonable quality images for a camera of this price|#|No manual operation. It is not possible to choose shutter speed and aperture, but this is common to most compact cameras.
9.0|#|Fuji generally have the best picture quality of Cameras in their relative league. I've had Fuji for years and always swear by them as I like their results. As is apparent on test show like The Gadget Show.|#|The same bad point I find with pretty much all digital devices nowdays which is they only have a tiny memory meaning you have to buy a memory card.
10.0|#|It looks gorgeous, is very light and compact, takes great pictures and videos and has a handy feature where it will take two of the same photograph for you (one with flash and one without) so you can compare :)|#|I haven't found any yet.
4.0|#|optical zoom|#|very light construction - panoramic shoots don't always stich togeher properly
2.0|#|a nice looking camera|#|the zoom quality is rubbish, especially photos taken in dark conditions, and half the lens cover fell out the first week i had it. ridiculous.
9.0|#|Compact and lightweight.  More than enough options for picture taking.  Great zoom.|#|Controls a bit fiddly, including recessed ON/OFF button, which is difficult to operate in a hurry.  Below average construction, for example the lens aperture has not been assembled square with the body of the camera.  Choice of picture file size not displayed, only the picture format, which I find confusing.
8.0|#|features|#|shutter does not always close properly
7.0|#|Excellent zoom range, fairly quick startup time very good image quality.|#|Low light focusing is poor. No optical image finder. zoom control could be smoother.

10.0|#|it has smile detection wink detection that you can set meaning you always get the best shot you can also take an option of it taking two shots one with flash one without so you can pick the best shot|#|none
10.0|#|worth the money and very easy to use definatley recommend good buy!!!|#|cant think of nothing at the moment,plus nothing gone wrong yet (touch wood)
9.0|#|It is what I expected from Fuji's made.|#|The on and off switch is not as sensitive
9.0|#|The camera is light weight, small and compact. It has a lot of feachures.|#|My one niggle is that the wheel that changes from one feachure to another, is very close to the edge. So when you pull the camera out of the case it is very easy to knock it on to another feachure. So you need to check every time you take a picture.
10.0|#|Very easy to use and takes brilliant photos, I would recommend this camera to everyone.|#|
2.0|#||#|poor quality images and delay on taking photos so you miss the moment ! I ended up returning this camera for the olympus tough which is a much better camera overall.
8.0|#|Has many features you would only expect on a DSLR. High resolution images from a very small, pocket-sized camera. Excellent camera for a beginner.|#|Lacks differential focus even at f5.6. Digital viewfinder difficult to see in bright light.
9.0|#|* easy to connect to PC to upload pics|#|be careful that the 'wheel' is on the setting you want before you start trying to take a picture. it can easily be turned to a different setting and i have accidentally started recording a video a couple of times when i wanted to take a photo. more annoying than anything but dont let it put you off buying this great little compact.

9.0|#|Large screen, useable @ 800ASA, low shutter lag, good battery life and rechargeable|#|inconsistant flash results
8.0|#|Excellent for taking shots at night and indoors. One great feature is the abilty to take 2 consistant shots with and without the flash - usually the ones with the flash come up trumps!

10.0|#|Very light and small. Easy to use straight from the box. Great pictures taken-especially in low light and quick action.|#|Battery pack-so when runs out camera useless till recharged-if out of doors a problem. No viewfinder so have to use screen-problem if have eye conditions. My fuji broke within a week.
10.0|#|Small easily pocketed camera, big screen, lots of easy to use features, 30fps filming that is saved as avi files, fits waterproof case. Battery has a long life. The body is well built, fast start up time, easy to upload photos|#|Grip on the body is limited
10.0|#|Fantastic performance in low light conditions without flash.  Very quick start up and picture capture. Exceptional battery life.  The sales material suggested up to 500 shots from one charge, and it really does. Very good on-screen menu display - much improved on the previous Fuji camera that I owned.|#|None really, but if being picky I would say that the cover for the pc and charger connection points was possibly a bit flimsy.  Time will tell.
10.0|#|The camara is very easy to use, the instruction book very simple to follow.|#|So far I have not found any bad points.

9.0|#|Large LCD display|#|No histogram display - making it harder to judge exposure
8.0|#|Good features, quick accurate focusing good colour rendition and good image quality at 100-800 ISO. Long battery life.|#|Images not as good as lead to believe for higher ISO 1600 and 3200. Too much noise. White balance needs to be adjusted regularly. Mode selection wheel too small. Screen still difficult to see in sunlight. Will probably look for optical viewfinder in future. No wonder sales of digital SLRs are increasing.

I have taken it on a jeep safari to Wadi Rum and to Petra in Jordan, to The pyramids and the Sphinx in Egypt and taken one hundred and fifty photographs on a 256 meg memroy card. All of the photos are perfect.|#|extranious background from my photographs, this camera does not do this.

10.0|#|Excellent camera easy to use picture quality very good the 12 megapixals give great quality when editing images|#|None known
6.0|#|Good looking photos, good battery life.|#|When using video mode on my recent ski trip, the camera shot the film with vertical lines right across the screen wherever a dark object appeared in the scene. The camera also couldn't read the majority of films that I'd recorded in the cold conditions (about -10 Celcius). Whereas, the camera that I bought it to replace (Finepix Z2) worked perfectly in video mode on my previous ski trip, when the temperature went as low as -22 Celcuis!
10.0|#|The stabilisation really works and the camera is easy to use.  Has some good features.  Definitely recommend.|#|In auto mode the picture has a lot of black dots (noise?) when zoomed to full-scale.  Recommend using SP1 setting, as that gives more control.  Haven't printed any of the photos yet so, have to wait and see how they come out.
8.0|#|This is the second Fujifilm Digital camera I have owned and this model is by far the superior. In fact for an inexperienced user of Digital  I find there are many features I may never be able to use but, at the moment concentrating on the AUTO feature I am finding slowly more and more I can understand. I am so far extremely satisfied with this camera the larger  view screen is for one thing an improvement on my original Fujifilm. Finepix. I hope in time I can use and understand the other many features with more confidence.|#|the metal cover could break away.  Also I am not sure if it is necessary to have  a DC coupler when using the cable connection I have bought for use when  using the Camera for long  periods of time, to save battery power.
10.0|#|Looks good, easy to use for the beginner yet plenty of extras for those who want more than just a normal digital camera|#|12megapixels is too much to see clearly on the LCD display on the back. Through a flat screen or laptop is the best way to check your pics.

8.0|#|I lik.e a viewfinder and camera has a comfortable feel. It has a positive shutter and the zoom controls are easy to use. The camera has several good options for taking non-automatic photographs such as black and white/|#|The camera can only just fit in a pocket.
7.0|#|Good features, such as the dual flash/natural setting, where it takes two pictures at once which I find very convenient.|#|Many photos taken without the flash are very grainy which is disappointing.
8.0|#|The camera was recommended to me by a photogragher to enable me to take the best still images with ease.  It would not be good for moving images.  I am very happy with the picture quality|#|It does not come with a case.
10.0|#|I was going to get a larger compact dig camera like one of the Canon Powershot range which is a bit bigger and uses AA Batteries.|#|A view finder would have been good but you cant have everything, 12 Meg Pix fantastic clear and large screen more than make up for it. A bit more zoom would have been good too but there is another model the F100FD if you need the 5x zoom. Li-Ion batteries are expensive and there are not a lot of third party ones for this model on the market at the moment.

10.0|#|Easy to use and simply instructions|#|Too bad it didn't come with a case, other than that , great
9.0|#|The face recognition technology is excellent.  Also found the movie feature handy when you wanted a video of the moments that you might treasure and don't have a camcorder to hand.  All the features are easy to use and the automatic scene selection options make for good pictures.|#|Only the zoom capability is not the greatest feature
10.0|#|I find the anti-shake setting very good which produces very sharp photos.|#|I have difficulty in relating the instructions given in the manual, in respect of menus, to the camera.

9.0|#|Easy to use - I'm not a real camera buff, but I understand the importance of the features of the camera. I bought it primarily for use underwater (in a fujifilm 30mtr housing!). I got some great shots while diving in the Red Sea.|#|Nothing I can think of at the moment
10.0|#|Every possible aspect of point and shoot has been thought of. I have used the camera in the water proof housing whilst diving in the philippeans. The photos were amazing just using the underwater setting with out any adjustments. Overall its the best pocket sized digi camera I have used. I also own the F810, and this even eclipses that, with the exception of the wide screen shot facility.|#|The only critisism if there is one, is it could do with a slightly longer zoom.

7.0|#|Nice large LCD, good colours, reasonable quality even at high ISO settings.|#|Picture quality not as good as I'd hoped: I have an old Pentax Optio S5i, and it struggles to match it at comparable ISO settings.  Shape not quite as ergonomic as it could be.  Flash too near the lens (without the auto-red-eye reduction doesn't really work too well).  Seems to want to underexpose many images.

9.0|#|i have 2 fuji bridge cameras and was looking for something small to slip into my pocket while out walking.This little camera fitted the bill perfectly.Has most of the features on a bigger more expensive camera but if you just want to point and shoot then get this camera.|#|screen gets scrapped easily and the body is very slippery,would recomend getting a camera pouch.
9.0|#|Very versitile camera at a good price, have looked at all on the market with 10x zoom and considering I wanted a good maker, this one is the best in it's range for me.|#|Don't like only having a manual on the cd. had to print it out so I can have it with me on my travels, Fuji sd cards and spape batterys are expensive, shop around on the net for better deal.
7.0|#|Great zoom and lots of different modes though I generally keep it on auto.|#|Didn't realise that to charge the camera I have to take the battery out and charge it in a dock.  Also photos are transferred to computer directly from the SD card.  This is fine if you have a newish computer/laptop since they come with a card slot otherwise you need to buy a card reader.  The cover for the battery and card is a bit flimsy and fiddly.
10.0|#|This camera is so easy to use, it sorts out all of settings for you so you just have to point and shoot, and with all of the different modes (sport, portrait, movie ect) you just select the required one and the camera sorts it all out for you- how easy can that be. With a 8 GBmemory card it can store just over 2500 images. Very compact and light.|#|Non :-)
7.0|#|Small and compact, face recognition. As a point and shoot camera once i am used to the settings should do the job well.|#|Takes time to understand how to use, appears that image stabiliser setting is only on auto not on other settings.
10.0|#|I bought this camera to replace an older one which had developed the habit of taking the photo very slowly... ie push the button and then 20seconds later it took the picture... this one is very quick.  The images to me are very good but then I only look at the overall picture not one of these people who examine it in the greatest detail.  The optical zoom is also very good.  I can't really fault it.  It didn't take particularly sharp picture inside to start with using the auto scene recognition but it is easy enough to change the settings on one of the function setting on the little wheel for this purpose which is what I have done, so when taking photos inside I use my own preferred settings.  It's actually quite compact for a camera with such a big zoom that was something else I wanted... its small enough to fit on my belt and forget that its there.|#|The screen is a little hard to see in bright light but that's true of a lot of things with screens in bright light!
10.0|#|Excellent value, excellent optical zoom and a great deal lighter than a bridge.|#|
9.0|#|I have a canon slr and this small compact camera takes some excellent shots for its size.It was bought for my wife and she is verry impressed|#|
10.0|#|instant pictures, no delay from button press to picture taken. superb quality of finish even at 10x zoom. we have had many of these type of cameras and out of 10 this is a clear 10, our next nearest would be about a 5... we wont be changing for a long time... (unless i drop it or something stupid)|#|nothing!!! its superb

8.0|#|Has been easy to pick up and use. Lovely big display and the most common functions are readily available without needing much instruction.|#|Excessive amount of features which can be confusing. The book of instructions was less informative than you would have liked. less diagrams more info.
7.0|#|Small, compact and sexy case with amazing optical zoom and loads of features. I bought (3rd party) a 4GB memory card and we used only a tiny fraction of its capacity on a 10 day holiday. I took the charger and needed to recharge the battery only once in almost 400 shots (and I am not sure that was strictly necessary). An excelllent camera with superb autofocus and it was easy to use because I left it on automatic 90% of the time. If you want to do anything special then read the manual carefully.|#|if possible then hold the button and re-compose the shot. Face recognition must be switched on and seemed to work rarely. Do not buy this camera for portraits or holiday snaps if you have dark skin - it will not light your face.
3.0|#|Very easy to use point and shoot camera with extended 10x zoom.|#|Very poor image quality. All images slightly blurred (worse indoors than out) and very poor contrast and depth of field on all settings. The images were so bad I thought the camera must be faulty and sent it back for a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement was exactly the same and I've sent that back too for a refund.

Lens cover a bit flimsy and, occasionally, doesn't close fully if the camera is not upright.

9.0|#|I had the 1st version of this camera the W1 which I thought was very good, there was a couple of things that let it down slightly, the video resolution was only low and the screen small and very hard to see in the sunlight. But Fuji have got it right this time, the video resolution has been increased to 720 and the screen size increased it is also very much brighter and somehow much clearer than the W1, so good you won't want to put down.

8.0|#|I got this camera in black, when i checked the reviews, a few people were saying that it was really plasticy and too light, i thought it was lightweight but not too much and it is built quite well. Also it takes really good pictures, especially outside. The picture quality and usage is better and easier than by dad's professional camera which he bought about 4 years ago. The macro is good as well, its in the flower setting. The video feature is good as well and is not blury when you play it back. The zoom is clear and doesn't blury even on thee highest level of zoom. A really good camera and easy to use!|#|Some of the features were a bit hard to find, and i still don't know how to delete mutiple pictures at once but its still really good and i don't even care about those things!

8.0|#|I also have a digital camera that is of equal quality but it is larger than the Finepix F470,I purchased the Fuji as a compact quality camera for any occasion,I have not been disappointed.|#|The xD memory cards are very expensive and may be if I was buying now I would have purchased a camera with anti-shake.
9.0|#|easy and quick enough to use for a quick snap, plenty of features for a better picture if you have the time to change settings.|#|Not really a bad point, but so many features and menus, I can never remember how to get to a particular setting to change it in a hurry without the book!
10.0|#|My Fuji 470 camera is small and lightweight. I like it very much and feel it needs to be carefully looked after. The photos are superb. When I have studied the handbook a bit more I am looking forward to taking some fantastic photos. My friend has the same camera and when I saw her beautiful flower close ups, taken using the macro feature, I was inspired to get one. I think I am going to enjoy this camera very much. It is easy to take general pictures. If you have a little knowledge of digital cameras you will have no problems getting to use this camera's other features. If you do not know much about these cameras it is well worth studying the handbook. I can't wait to get started.I could highly recommend it. The rechargeable battery is very quick to charge up compared with other makes that I have loooked at.|#|Actually turning the camera on and off and turning to different modes are easy.I found that it is slightly more complicated at first, than some other cameras when finding your way around the menu eg looking at how to erase more than one photo at one go.  I feel I need to study the handbook a lot more first but it will be worth spending a bit of time as the results are great.  But then, I am only quite new to digital photography and never bothered with ordinary cameras at all before.I find it is best to carry it in a  camera case as I do not want to scratch the screen.
10.0|#|It was a present for my daughter, she has been very creative with the special effects. She is very pleased with it|#|I have not heard her mention any

10.0|#|Small, easy to use, great quality photos!|#|--------
9.0|#|Big screen, good picture, fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it!|#|No viewfinder.  I always used the viewfinder on my F440, as I got a better picture and was less likely to get camera shake.  Not as robust and well made as the F440 - more plasticy.  Have to take the battery out to charge it rather than just plug in the camera.
10.0|#|Easy to hold and operate, excellent quality images|#|None
8.0|#|Very easy to use camera|#|none
9.0|#|Physically small. 6.2 Mps. Large viewfinder. XD cards are physically small but with large capacity. Lithium battery which lasts a good couple of hours so no need to carry spare batteries. Unused it keeps charged for a weeks.|#|No view finder. Difficult to see the screen in bright conditions.
10.0|#|Very easy and fool proof to use. Takes a good quality photo.|#|Did not come with a case
8.0|#|photographers like me!|#|Earlier Fuji F450 came with a cradle that plugged directly into the PC and charged the battery while it was still in the camera.  This was a great feature that they should not have got rid of.  When you take the battery out to recharge, date settings lost which is a little annoying.
10.0|#|Well built and very easy to use in most modes though the manual mode takes some understanding but if you just need point and shoot you cant go wrong. The camera is easy to hold. The switch on is very fast for a digital camera and it will take up to 5 pictures a second very good for children and animal photo's. The 10x zoom is really handy ,and what makes it even better is the image stabilization that allows you to take high zoom pictures without the shake so they end up very clear and sharp without a tripod. Using it to record video  was very easy and gave excellent resultss.Overall I am quite impressed with the camera and can recommend it for any keen amateur photographer who would like near professional results.|#|When using the video function if you zoom in you can hear the motor noise in the background on playback.
10.0|#|The EXR is brilliant, no need to mess about with different settings as it does it for you. Haven't tried the different settings yet as have had no need to - just put it on EXR which I suppose is making me lazy! The large screen is fantastic, such clear pictures, lovely long zoom. Love the animal face recognition, I've got 6 cats!|#|Would be nice if it came with a case, and shame the owners manual is only on-line
9.0|#|Easy to use, lots of fantastic features and programs, but the EXR mode is so brilliant you probably won't use anything else!  Nice weight to it, having a glossy metal body, but do buy some screen protectors.  The image quality and optical zoom are amazing, and the Pet Detection is pure genius.  Small enough to keep handy in your bag when you haven't got space for a full size DSLR.  Would definately recommend it - although it might seem a bit pricey compared to other compacts, the quality results more than make up for it.|#|Glass-like preview screen - I can see this getting damaged if not careful!
9.0|#|Excellent zoom. Being an optical zoom it's just as clear at full zoom as it is with no zoom, unlike most compact cameras.|#|Battery life is only average.
10.0|#|I can do what I wanted to do - just point and click but with 10x zoom it gets me closer to what I want to photograph. The EXR setting is incredible and takes all the confusion out of what setting I need to produce the best shot. Also the light gathering is better than my previous Fuji which means macro shots are much clearer|#|Still looking for one!!!!!!!!!!
10.0|#|The image quality is great. Easy to use. Very compact.|#|The wheel used to change picture type is easy to catch putting in and out of a case. be sure to check the setting each use.
1.0|#|Very pretty. Nice screen|#|Quality of photos is dire. EXP is supposed to be the answer to low light and indoor photography. When any pictures are blown up to any size, the result is just a mess of noise. All finer detail is lost because the processor in the camera tries to flatten out any of what it sees as imperfections and as a result the picture just is useless. I have been a Fuji buyer for a long time. This was a real let down.
9.0|#|Great Camera, sleek, light yet robust, excellent zoom, lots of options to play about with, Fantastic big screen to take and review pictures, superb picture quaity, video option is good, good battery life, would definetly recommend this camera to anyone, small enough to fit in a pocket unnoticed, quick download of pictures/videos to pc,|#|The flash could have been better positioned-maybe its just the way my friends and I hold the camera but when we take a picture we sometimes put our finger(s) over the flash which means night shots or interior shots can come out very dark which can be annoying, The option to choose which picture to take on the dial (night shot, Auto, video etc) is quite sensitiveand moves about a bit too freely, so I usually take pictures on various options instead of keeping it on the one i had previously-constantly having to check before i take a picture can be frustrating! Instruction Manual isnt the best but there are websites out there that help you to get to grips with it. Video option doesnt have the best sound pickup but is good enough.
10.0|#|We bought it because it has a fast shutter speed so we could catch those first baby smiles.  It has lived up to expectations and we have some fantastic pictures.  It's easy to use and the picture quality is great.  The optical zoom means that the quality is still good even when zoomed right in. Really pleased with this camera.|#|
9.0|#|All the features that i required and more. Has all, inc 10x zoom in a package that is easily transportable. Very pleased.|#|Dont like the album arrangement. When you  have used other systems (and still do) it is dificult to merge the new with the old. ie when albums have been established over the years, you make changes, our move the pictures several times through the computer to get them to the end source that you want.
10.0|#|i have had five digital cameras in the past from point and shoot  to SLR , the f80exr is by far the best . its easy to use and has loads of good features and picture quality is top rate . i would recomend this to anyone its so easy to use  .|#|cant find any

9.0|#|Light and compact enough to carry in your pocket, good image quality, easy to use.|#|You really need to carry a spare charged battery around with you as you can't just grab some AA's from the nearest shop if you run low on power - but then the battery type helps with the compactness of the camera.
10.0|#|This camera is excellent, it works well. had it a month now and am very pleased with it, the 10* zoom is very good, the camera feels well made and I hope it will give me years of pleasure. Had not time to try out all the features yet. I would recommend this camera. good value for the money.|#|No bad points that I know of at the moment.
9.0|#||#|Although the pictures look nice, there's still noise on the pictures when you zoom in...  not.an issue for family snaps but if you're after the most perfect images possible rather than a camera easy to use that does the decision making for touch then I'd take a look at the Panasonic TZ8 or TZ10.  I personally like the EXR sensor in this though, it's a gem, esp for taking those special heat of the moment shots that are normally gone by the time you've picked your camera settings.

I looked at a number of different digital mini cameras, but went with the Fuji because I bought a Fuji FinePix Pro camera about four years ago. My guess was that already having a Fuji, the nw one would have a very similar system of operation. I was correct in thinking this. Learning how to operate the new camera was a very straightforward. My 14 year old son is also using the camera on a regular basis.|#|None so far
9.0|#|splendid quality compact camera.it is very easy to use and the large screen on the back makes it great for playing back of photos that have been taken with ease and clarity.the slide screen show makes it look really professional on playback,with options of music,fade in/out ect..great fun for all types of shots,portrait,scenes and inside photography.|#|no real bad points,the buttons are quite sensitive to touch and if you have large hands you may find it a bit fiddly.
9.0|#|Battery live seams rather good so far.|#|no view finder - digital display difficult to see, if against the sun
8.0|#|( P.s. It was cappuccino brown not shell pink!!)|#|Socket on camera for USB connection extremely fiddly to open!!
8.0|#|very good picture quality. the design of the camera itself is quite a talking point - with the sliding lens cover etc.|#|slightly hard to navigate round the functions at times
10.0|#|Good quality photos.|#|None
10.0|#|This product is both attractive to the eye and possesses unique qualities which makes it a desirable camera. The covering over the lens is very rare amongst many modern products but still an essential feature, in my view. The variety of settings are useful for less competent photogrophers, making it easy to use. The settings are labelled according to the event (such as party, portrait. landscape and so on) which guarantee the perfect image in all settings. There is also a timer on this camera ranging from 2 seconds to 10 which avoids those embarrassing encounters of asking a stranger to take those embarrassing pictures. Therefore, i believe this is a camera which will appeal to many stylish, less confident photographers who want the perfect image for all occassions.|#|
8.0|#|Has amazing capabilities for a small camera but my experience with digital is limited, I like it so that's important.|#|The sliding lens cover/ on, off switch is novel but a bit quircky. although warned how not to open it, it's sometimes difficult not to rub your fingers over the lens.  I've had it  for approx 6 weeks and the black either side of the lens has scratched. The disp/back buttons are quite fiddly but  I'm not as young as I used to be!!
9.0|#|Flash is also pretty impressive|#|Battery life could be a touch better especially when recording video which drains it quite quickly
9.0|#|Very compact and neat, attractive design, ideal for pocket or handbag, Large viewing screen. Excellent picture quality and numerous useful features|#|Screen image difficult to see in sunlight and no alternative viewfinder. Lens inconveniently placed for holding (but one quickly gets used to this.
9.0|#|5x Zoom very useful and unusual so puts camera well ahead of its competitors in same price range or even above it. Very good picture quality. Very small, neat and light to fit a handbag. Quick flash recharge. Undoubtedly best camera to have to fit all occasions and light and easy enough to keep on you all the time.|#|Software that comes with it was not very helpful and so used other picture manager software. The LCD screen does not perform well in strong sunlight so difficult to see (but very few do, only Canon I gather). Would be great if there was a viewfinder therefore. Cable point on camera to connect camera to computer a bit fiddly but not critical.
9.0|#|Easy to use, compact, good quality of pictures.|#|No camera cover, battery run's flat quickly.
9.0|#|Easy to get started. Screen good size and makes using video feature easy. Rechargeable battery lasts well.  Optical zoom great, most 8 mill pixel cameras seem only to have 3x not 5x like this one. Picture quality good.|#|Camera memory small and no memory card supplied.  No case supplied either, doesn't travel well in handbag unprotected!  Alot of instructions to read as has so many features so suspect wont get around to using some of them.

I still think the build quality is good for a tiny camera.
9.0|#|Good quality photos. Simple to use. Quick to shoot photos of good quality without much worries.|#|Not easy to switch between modes. Mediocre night shots.

7.0|#|well built, good images|#|Poor access to movie mode
10.0|#|A lot of great features in a small, slick package. Nice colour too. The way the lens cover glides across is a miracle of engineering!|#|Only minor drawback is that it is easy to smudge the lens as it is in the top corner, so you need to re-educate yourself on how to hold a camera.

10.0|#|Nice and compact, easy to use. Looks nice|#|
8.0|#|5X zoom, price, quite good resolution|#|controls a bit confusing - mainly because each manufacturer arranges them (and labels them) differently. Come back simple 'on' and 'off' signs!
9.0|#|My wife has a Finepix Z f3 which she finds easy to use, and ideal to carry in a handbag.|#|I am also concerned that the flap opening on to the download plug does not look very robust.  I shall not be pleased if it breaks during the life of the camera.

9.0|#|The menu is easy to navigate and there is a large range of shooting modes. Playback is simple to use and easy to switch back to shooting mode.|#|This camera was an upgrade from my FinePix A210.  I found the new software (KA Version 2.0a)  inferior to my previous FinePix programme (SX Version 4.0g). I ended up uninstalling the new software and now use Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard to transfer the photos from camera to PC and then use my old software to edit and correct red eye etc.

8.0|#|A really good point and shoot camera with options to fine tune if desired, barely noticable lag time under normal conditions, good features for a camera at this price - the face detection in particular.|#|The software does have to go through every pic. on the camera every download rather than miss out previously saved pics which is a bit annoying.
9.0|#|Small and compact, slips easily into ones pocket, yet not too small to handle comfortably. Good range of facilities, including ISO, auto focus, review, etc. Photograph results are amazing.

9.0|#|Small and compact, very easy to use.  Ideal to carry around with you just incase you want to take a photo without having a great big camera bag.  Quality of photos very good, nice feature being able to take two photos one with flash and one without.  No complaints so far.|#|Zoom could be better but adequate for what I wanted - I have another Fuji with better zoom ie 10x but it was £100 more.
10.0|#|all round excellent camera|#|i find it to small to handle i have arthritis, cannot add a neck srap.
9.0|#||#|No viewfinder, some users may not be used to just looking at the screen to frame the picture they are taking
10.0|#|All round this is a great general purpose compact camera.|#|It would be good for it to have a slight higher level of optical zoom but again 3x appears to be the norm for equivalent cameras.
10.0|#|Very high quality pictures from such a small point and click camera, especially in the dark, the flash is amazing|#|Would like it if I could put a bigger SD card in, but it's not the end of the world. Finding the option you want in the menus can sometimes take a few attempts

9.0|#|This camera takes nice clear pictures easily. It's simple to use and compared to other cameras in a similar price range is superior in functions and quality. It's no wonder it has been highly commended by camera reviewers.|#|None really!
10.0|#|Fantastic camera.  Although there are lots of features, the camera is just so user friendly.  The battery charged within 2 and a half hours and I was therefore able to use the camera really quickly and easily and I managed to make use of lots of the features without having to keep referring back to the instructions as the camera prompts you in many cases. The screen on the back is large and review what has been taken is easy in any light.  Software probably the easiest I've ever used. Would and have recommended this camera. Have found this camera a pleasure to use.|#|None found so far and have used it nearly every day.
8.0|#|Good size screen 3inch, easy to use, very good camera for the price.|#|Does not display time and date on pics when printed!!
10.0|#|Fantastic quality of photos, crystal clear images. Very easy to use - particularly like the double shot setting where one is in natural light followed by one with flash.Sports setting is brilliant, moving images we captured are pin point sharp. Very easy to switch from photo to video with use of the dial and excellent quality and sound. Really wide choice of settings for different subjects such as flower,beach, landscape etc. Can't rate this product enough, also very neat, sturdy and compact. loads of other brilliant features. Reccommend fuji anytime, also own a fuji SLR and we have never been disappointed!|#|Doesn't have a very big zoom, however the images taken are so sharp that you can easily zoom in and crop once the photo is taken and the quality is not lost so in a sense you are doubling the zoom capacity

7.0|#|Nice 'feel', good range of features, quick shutter response, large view window and clever face recognition technology|#|Just doesn't take great pics, especially indoors: old Nikon definitely had better and sharper colour definition.
10.0|#|its just great|#|none
10.0|#|Image quality is very good.|#|As with most compacts, it doesn't have a RAW setting but then it does allow him to learn the basics first!

9.0|#|The auto focus and portrait facefinder|#|A bit wider than my previous Olympus camera
10.0|#|Like the automatic eye recognition/red eye removal.|#|None so far...
10.0|#|Very easy to use in auto scene recognition mode. If you want more control, then this has almost as many settings as a  DSLR.|#|It only comes with a basic printed manual - the full manual is on a CD.
10.0|#|I had a Fujifilm F410 previously, very good camera but the F60fd is even better|#|None
9.0|#|It has a strong sturdy feel to it and one of the main reasons I bought this model was the 3in screen. The 12 mega pixels features provides me with good qaulity pictures for my use.|#|I would have preferred bigger display buttons but this would not put me off purchasing this model.

9.0|#|Good quality point and shoot, produces very good photos.  Has lots of optional features, face recognition, etc which I have yet to fully explore.|#|
8.0|#|The picture quality is lovely|#|The USB cable that comes with the product is really short - this has meant I have caught my arm in the loop between the cable and computer and the camera fell on the floor!
1.0|#||#|Badly made, doesn't deliver a reasonable photo, would highly recommend anyone buys this complete waste of money.
8.0|#|easy to use, compact and gives picture quality I wanted|#|
8.0|#||#|Screen doesn't seem as clear as older fuji cameras that I have owned.
9.0|#|Its very simple. Doesn't let you fiddle with many settings, so its great for someone as a beginner camera, or who isn't used to all the different settings there are on digital cameras. The modes are clearly explained when you select them, so you don't have to waste time trying to guess what picture mode to choose.|#|Some pictures when blown up to full size (even on high quality) look a little grainy. It could just be down to poor lighting in a few of my photos. This isnt too much of a problem though, because I rarely blow up my pictures to full size.
5.0|#|Good value for a Fujifilm and has some easy to use features.|#|A very flimsy shutter looks as though it could be easily damaged. The camera has a very long delay on shutter speed which makes taking pictures extremely difficult, many are not usable. The camera is very susceptible to shake, especially when using the zoom, many pictures are far too blurred to use. Even for a point and press photographer I find it very annoying and not as classy or good looking as other fujifilms I have used. In all I would spend extra on a J50fd if buying again!
7.0|#|Pretty good value for money.   Takes good quality pictures easy to use|#|viewing screen becomes unusable due to glare in bright light.   Most cameras provide an alternative view not using screen.
10.0|#|It's nice and small and compact. I find it very easy to use|#|No view finder so not easy to use if very sunny conditions.
8.0|#|Works well with the kids, easy to fire, bit of a delay with the shutter, thought as your using the screen only to see the subject it does not seem to matter, as opposed to my older fuji 40i which have a viewfinder and zero delay on the shutter.|#|Don't expect 10mega pixels photos to be like a digital SLR, you are still limited to what the good zoom lens can manage.
8.0|#|Small and compact,with easy to use features, and good zoom.|#|No view finder, and screen often difficulty to use.
9.0|#|Very easy to use. Large imaging screen|#|Lacks view finder- difficult to see viewer in bright sunlight
8.0|#|Easy basic use. Good battery life. Good quality picture.|#|Lense shutter doesnt seem robust.
8.0|#|Very good quality photoes and pretty easy to use. I am very happy with this product and i would say that compared to cameras with similar price, this one is really a good value for money.|#|Its just that when you want to return to taking photoes after looking back at the previous ones you have to press the same botton as you would for taking a photo and thats why you some times just take axidental photos while trying to go back.
10.0|#|Large viewing screen and different picture shooting modes. I especially like the mode available for action shots which is ideal for children on the go!|#|Because the camera is so small, when you turn it on your finger is often in the way of the zoom lens. Also there is no view finder which I haven't found to be a problem yet, but may be a problem if I cannot see the image on the screen-due to bright sunlight??
6.0|#|easy to use, good value for money, several different settings|#|Low colour quality.
9.0|#|Great megapixels.|#|Flash is too bright.
9.0|#|I bought it just after Christmas and it seems great so far!  I had an older Fuji camera, and getting this, you can see how great the quality of the pictures are, and also the flash is much better than my previous camera.  The colours are clear and bright. I would definately recommend.|#|Not as many features as some cameras you can get - it doesn't have black and white etc, but then again, you can change this on a computer.  Also, you can't change the ISO etc settings yourself
9.0|#|Small size, great pictures on the go, easy to operate and carry|#|little slow on start up for that 'once in a lifetime picture'
8.0|#|Particularly like the zoom.  Nice lightweight handy to use camera .|#|On and off button a bit small.
8.0|#|Takes very good pictures, with a very good quality.  Nice and light and easy to use.|#|The flash can sometimes be too bright if stood too close to someone with fair skin in a dark room (i.e in a night club), in that it can make the face white.
8.0|#|Excellent lens and very good range of picture scenes. Battery life seems to be good for such a lightweight camera|#|No case supplied.

10.0|#|Nice looking, light enough to put in your pocket. Very easy to use battery much better than small ones that need recharging all the time.|#|None
8.0|#|Camera has a metal case which gives me more confidence when using it in harsh conditions. 5x optical zoom. Nice big LCD screen. Anti-shake works really well. Overall image quality was excellent.|#|If it's sunny, LCD screen suffers. An alternative view such as on old cameras would be nice. Not enough options for focus. Didn't handle sunny conditions that well. Night time pictures didn't work well.

7.0|#|The features are very well explained on screen, so that it can be immediately put to use with good results.|#|The supplied software freezes on my PC, which exceeds the required specification, and the camera is not recognised as a memory device using Windows Explorer and utilities.

9.0|#|I love everything really, The different modes are so easy to use and change whilst in use and I love that it tells you on the screen which you have allocated too so you can't do the wrong one by mistake. The zoom is fantastic and so easy to change whilst taking your shot. I'm a digital scrapbooking designer (www.gallimaufryuk.blogspot.com) and use it for work  in conjunction with Photoshop and took over 300 shots in my first week using it. I especially adore the anti shake mode which I use alot. The big screen is great too. The battery charges up so quickly and with its own charger which is great!|#|Otherwise a fab deal! The baterry runs down quicker when videoing but that's only to be expected I guess!

Seriously so simple to use I bought them for my children (9 and 7) and they love'em. Can't say enough about it - I personally have a Lieca compact and an SLR so know a bit about cameras. For sure there may be better cameras out there but not waterproof ones for this price, not even close.|#|None found yet

9.0|#|Used the camera whilst snorkelling in the Caribbean and it was fantastic - did exactly what it says.  Photos out of the water are equally as good.|#|It would be useful if the camera strap had a lock on it for when you are swimming so it doesn't slip off you wrist (something like on the strap for the Wii controller).
9.0|#|good quality pictures underwater,small,therefore easy to swim with ,excellent battery life. Fuji remains the best for underwater pictures. We have had two previous Fujis(with waterproof case) and a pentax optio and a olympus tough. In terms of penetration under water the Fuji outclasses the others and produces superior pictures with excellent colour|#|battery/ card slot fiddly to open. As a waterproof camera, the strap should have a toggle on it to prevent it coming off the wrist while swimming
10.0|#|this camera takes good pictures in and out of the water,but the underwater ones are amazing and very clear along with the videos|#|can only think of one that being when u are under water with it the wrist strap doesnt tighten so when we were snorkling i was always worried about loosing it
9.0|#|The underwater function kept the kids occupied for hours and playback is great quality.  Movie quality is great - I filmed my son on a rollercoaster and didn't lose image focus once.|#|The battery doesn't last as long as other cameras I've owned - it would be good if you could buy a back up battery so you always have one on charge.  If using all the functions, the battery wouldn't last for a whole day out.

I only used it one weekend so far, the main reason for buying it is to take when kayaking or rafting when I won't risk my SLR.|#|You can only setup shots from the screen view, there's no viewfinder and it's VERY hard to see in bright light, but for the price it's wonderful, no complaints considering it was a waterproof and under £100!

7.0|#|Good little camera bought specifically for a diving holiday in Egypt. Very easy to use in the water good image on both pics and video|#|Did let water in one day but we dried it out fine and think this was caused by extreme temp change from hot beach bag to colder water so avoided this happening again and had no problems. Also had a problem on one occasion only with the battery charging which meant we didn't get pics of swimming with turtles on one day which was dissapointing.

10.0|#|It is so small and compact, yet takes fantastic photos. My wife and I bought the camera for my sons birthday and with out using it first he took it straight on holiday to America. Now, no disrespect to my son but he is not the most technical person in the world, (as his father is not either). Having said that the photos taken with the camera are fantastic with not a bad one amongst them.|#|I would have liked a quality case to come with it being the price the camera is but I can only guess the reason is to keep the price as low as possiable. The other thing is why no written/printed full instruction book as I tryed twice to print off the cd disc on two accations alas with no success, I found this VERY FRUSTATING.

It does not have lots of additional features, but for someone who doesnt know what half of them mean and simply wants to take decent photographs and movies, its ideal.

8.0|#|Really nice design slips easily into a pocket almost un noticed. Very quick to start up and be ready for the next shot. 8mp makes for a lot of detail in the picture.|#|Auto exp system can easily produce a bad picture with difficult backlighting. The quality of some pictures away from the centre is quite noticeable, but still good for a camera with such a small lens.
9.0|#|This is our first digital camera so didn't want anything too complicated.  Still learning how to use it but very pleased so far.|#|
9.0|#|Feels just like an SLR.|#|3 ISO settings is very lame when you consider lesser cameras often have more.
9.0|#|Ideal camera for experienced photographers who like maximum control, want top quality prints, at a reasonable price|#|A lens hood should be supplied as standard
8.0|#|Easy to use, generally gives good quality at 6M setting (but see below), good selection of focal length and zoom settings. Good choice of features.|#|Nigh-on impossible to use fiters and other lens accessories effectively due to outer lens design (even when taking into account operation of zoom system mechanics).
9.0|#|Good looks, body shape, mass, shutter button position are near ideal giving great confidence when handling. Lens resolution pin-sharp. Useful telephoto at 210mm equiv. Shutter button tapped for remote release. Alternative eye-level view finder useful for the short sighted if checking display-text. The advanced features almost mirror those found on 35mm cameras and must appeal to those who from time to time require an extra degree of control. Up to 800ASA almost makes the flash redundant, indoor pictures more natural. Eight white balance settings make for delightful 'arty' tinting. FinePixViewer with slide show software is excellent. Micro-drive facility priceless for the occasional movie opportunity (CF-1GB will run for up to 30').|#|.

10.0|#|For an archaeology group such as ours, it is the kind of camera that anyone can pick up and use without training.  For more advanced macro photography of very small items found during the archaeology it is second to none, having a closer macro focus distance than any of its rivals. It has stood up to all the weather and mud that archaeology could throw at it.|#|The battery life seems short but I have no other equivalent camera to test it against.  Sometimes the event has disappeared before the lens has come out after switching the camera on. Wildlife photography is a good example. Then when you wait for the bird/animal to return the battery saver retracts the lens again at the critical moment.  All these features are changeable but you have to refer to the menu which is a bore, and time consuming. Again it did not affect the archaeology, the main purpose for which it was bought.

9.0|#|All round good camera, well worth the 310 quid i paid at ukdigital|#|Changing from compact flash to xd gets a card error message. Tried several cameras but all had same fault. But I don't think this is amajor problem
9.0|#|facility.|#|Slightly long shutter delay - not good for catching the moment.
9.0|#|The camera offers an amazing ammount of facilities especially for the price.  It is comparitively easy to use for point and shoot however it can be used for more intricate work more in line with a quality SLR.|#|None
8.0|#|When you get the hang of it it takes excellent pictures. Easy to use and the switch between viewing through the lens is excellent.|#|Have to keep refering to instruction book. Uses lots of batteries. Finepix software difficult to load and not user friendly. Works well with Adobe photoshop elements.
9.0|#|Picture quality very good if camera kept absolutely still.|#|Too heavy for me.  I cannot keep camera still enough without leaning against something.  OK for son who is tall and strong.
8.0|#|well built and the image quality is excellent.|#|extensive technical photographic knowledge is required to get the best out of this camera.  viewing screen smaller than newer cameras. flash not quite up to the job.
8.0|#|Well made, well performing, well priced camera. Good quality video recording too.|#|Shutter lag - made worse by electronic viewfinder lag.
9.0|#|This camera produces the most fantastic digital pictures.  Great clarity.  Great zoom.  So easy to hold.  I particularly like the digital viewfinder so what you see is what you get in your photos.  You can also review your photos through the viewfinder which makes it simple in bright light.  I am also keen on its use of standard rechargeable batteries. You can recharge one set while using any other AA batterise. (Unlike my other camera where the battery has to be recharged in the camera, meaning you cannot use it while recharging.)|#|The camera has no bad points, but users should realise it is quite a complex beast if you want to use all its functions.
10.0|#|The quality and zoom are amazing.|#|can be a bit complicated with an 80 page manual, it's not a point and click camera. BUT THAT@S NOT WHAT YOU BUY THIS FOR.

9.0|#|Needed to get a camera quickly as old camera was stolen.  Went out of their way to help and received camera in time for daughter's christening|#|Product bad points mainly relate to the battery consumption.  Shame camera doesn't have an internal rechargeable battery and docking stand.

8.0|#|After reading the instruction book fully - a necessity - I found the camera easy to operate in the modes I use the most, which are program and manual.|#|Colours are sometimes a bit unrealistic, although the worst point by a long margin is the horrendous shutter lag. Not a problem if the user takes landscapes, but a pain if they do transport photography. I have lost countless pictures due to that 'feature' which admittedly is less of a problem as technology moves on.

10.0|#|Hundreds of features with this model, a good step between an amateur camera and a professional SLR camera. I've taken over 2000 pictures since buying this camera, and i'm happy with the vast majority of them. This camera is also extremely user-friendly, although daunting at first (about 30 different buttons and dials on the camera). Very good screen sized video.|#|Sometimes have to fiddle about with the manual controls in some conditions to get a better shot, but no other problems.
8.0|#|a good entry level digital slr type camera|#|need an adapter to put a filter on lens which doesnt retract when camera is turned off making the cammera a bit bulky.

10.0|#|Simple and easy to use for someone with little knowledge of digital cameras|#|The handbook is not very straightforward to understand when first setting up the camera.
4.0|#||#|You cannot take black and white photos. The zoom is also pretty rubbish - it simply zooms in, it doesn't really focus on what you are zooming in on. With hindsight, i'd pay a bit more and get a much better camera.

9.0|#|Very easy to use and takes good quality pictures for what is essentially an entry-level/budget camera.

9.0|#|The camera is relatively easy to use and I enjoy using all the different settings and features|#|The camera is rather bulky and quite hard to carry around
10.0|#|Large visual screen at back of camera instead of a view finder - very easy to use and with this screen gives much more freedom to source accurately, the subject of photograph.|#|So far, have not encountered any bad points - my other digital is a Sony 3.2 which has given me problems at times, but this camera as far as I am concerned is A1.
9.0|#|Excellent value for the money. Conistently good results when there is plenty of light (indoors and outdoors), otherwise you have to rely on flash. Extremely easy to use. Superb results in macro mode. Excellent for copying old black and white photographs. Lots of differents scene modes which work well. Try and take it back now I have used it for a month.|#|Not so good in poor daylight, but flash improves it. Plastic body, but what do you want for the money?
8.0|#|Really easy to use - point and shoot almost straight out of the box. Competitive features and quality compared with similar cameras from other manufacturers around that price point.|#|Nothing significant - it is very good value for what it is - a simple, easy to use, low cost digital camera. Software is standard fujifilm and there are much better free or low cost packages available e.g. Picassa.

It also did not fit into your hand comforably and a it was quite light you felt like you were constanly going to drop it. I actually returned this camera the day it arrived and got a canon one instead.
10.0|#|Light weight. Compact. Large picture screen at back. Easy step by step instrutions. Numerous settings to ensure best setting for picture for all circumstances. Easy set up written instructions.|#|No bad points as such - compared to other digitl cameras I have used this was by far the best -  If anything there are lots of settings that  other cameras do not have - up to the users wether they use/learn them all
8.0|#|Great compact camera with generally easy to use features. Auto 'idiot' feature that allows you to 'let the camera take over'. Battery life is great and doesn't take too long to recharge. A great 1st camera with the ability to improve your knowledge of camera.|#|Too many camera settings which have similar settings. Slight problem with camera shake, although stabiliser can be used but, to the best of my knowledge, can't be used with other functions/ settings.

Battery charging is both quick and easy without having to use yet another transformer.|#|Have not come across any as yet,

8.0|#|Very compact and easy to use.  Handy to keep in pocket for those unexpected snaps.  Very stylish.  Was bought as an additional camera to my cannon 350D SLR to provide a small camera which did not compromise on quality etc.  To date very pleased with purchase.  Photos look good on computer but to date none printed.|#|Came with a 2 pin charger instead of a British one
9.0|#|Tiny little camera, small enough to fit in any womens handbag or mans pocket(smaller than my mobile) slim sleek stylish look, extremley light weight.  Great camera to carry around at all times to take snap shots when and where you see them.  Id say a perfectly formed camera with everything you would need.  Good price in comparision to others with the same features|#|i havent found any.

10.0|#||#|None
8.0|#|Great functions. Great picture. Nice colour, Great price|#|To few buttons for the vast amount of great functions. Turns on by sliding the front open, (no power button) so could easily open in your pocket.
9.0|#|A good all rounder at a great price. Easy to use, liked the sliding on/off shutter, no parts can get damaged as no extending lens to worry about. A great buy for my daughters 21st birthday.|#|None.
10.0|#|The pictures are clearer and it is really easy to use. It is ideal for the absolute beginner and also has great features for people who have a bit more knowledge on photography.|#|The two round buttons are on the slight small side for the average size fingers but they are manageable.
9.0|#|A brilliant camera, great image quality and built in features for all kinds of subjects. My favourite is a function that takes the photo with and without flash with one press of the button and allows you to compare the images. It also has a useful feature for taking 3 images and storing them together on one photograph to load onto auction sites. Also useful to have a slide over switch which protects the lens when camera is not in use.|#|Finger prints on the silver parts! Although it's less than 1/5 of the camera it still shows when there are fingerprints on them, the design of the camera is such that all the parts that need to be touched are silver e.g. click button, front slide, and side where you hold the camera.
9.0|#|The flash is also very good and brings out the colour in the darkest of places.|#|The Fujifilm setup seems a bit basic compared to other makes. Even though the features are all good, there aren't many types of flashes, shutter speeds, and other shooting options.
9.0|#|Good photos,good video,quite easy to use,very small compact and lightwieght camera,one of the better compact cameras|#|Quite a large technical manual
9.0|#|Different setting for surroundings... like beach etc. Has anti blurr which is easy to control. The colour is unique, would recommend this product for the size and value for money.|#|Price varies greatly and the green colour was hard to find.
8.0|#|Easy to use, my son is 8 and can navigate the software.|#|would be better to have a usb charger.
10.0|#|I love this camera it is small, easy to use and great quality.  The photo quality is fantastic.  It does all I wanted and more.  I would certainly recommend this camera to anyone.|#|You do need a memory card or you can only take a couple of pictures.
9.0|#|The colour, Easy to use, Slide feature to turn on, Different modes for different photo types.   Battery life is OK.|#|Smudging on silver on side, Battery life is OK. Focus is SOMETIMES annoying, however it is good on an object (I had to take lot of photo's of birds that are in cages, it focused perfectly on the birds and avoided the bars)
9.0|#|very compact, good looking, fairly intuitive to use. Anti red-eye is great. The zoom feature is simple and the software really enables you to imporove the end quality of your pictures. It's my first digital camera and overall I'm very pleased with it.|#|I have had difficulty inserting a memory card, or rather getting the camera to accept it although this might be something I am doing wrong. The  cover for where you insert the USB lead is has a worryingly flimsy-feeling attachment - I am concerned this will break with much use.The battery life doesnt seem very long - ran low over a week away but again, I am still learning how to use the camera properly.
8.0|#|Solid and weighty feel.  Large clear screen.  Simple to use on screen menus.  Small enough to carry in pocket.|#|None yet!
8.0|#|easy to use and pretty good quality pics,|#|none really apart from you can easily turn the flash off accidently because of the position of the button
9.0|#||#|Battery life is a little disappointing.
9.0|#|It is light and slim. I love the colour (mine is pink). The picture quality is good and the options for night, beach pictures etc are easy to find.|#|When you half press the button to take a photo it focuses but you have to make sure you press the take picture button hard or you get the focus option not a picture taken and sometimes that can be annoying and you miss a shot. The focus option should be taken away from the take picture button.
9.0|#|Ready to take a picture immediatly.|#|Reviewing pictures taken is fiddly
9.0|#|Very easy to use, quick to change modes and quick to take photos. The flash is excellent too. I would recommend this to anyone|#|Could have done with more night modes, such as a fireworks mode. Other than that, really excellent.
10.0|#|Trendy design, slim, excellent picture quality and easy to use.|#|

9.0|#|reassuringly, conteracts all possible idiot-led mistakes.|#|To a technophobe all the necessary technical stuff, connecting wires, Instruction book etc, is a bit daunting, especially if you want to use it in a hurry. But once basics are mastered it has really good properties.

9.0|#|Bought for my partner,who was having difficulty operating our other fuji camera.One of the main reasons was because her eyesight isn't what it used to be she was having trouble looking at what she was taking,this has eliminated that,also used to have a little shake problem now and again but this appears to have solved that as well.|#|None that spring to mind.
9.0|#|It not only looks cool but it is easy to use and takes a great pic.|#|Hard to watch videos.

9.0|#|Excellent pictures and features which you usually only get with cameras at twice this price.  It is in a league of it's own and looks very fashionable as well.  Battery life is fanatastic and LCD is large. We got it for our 6 year old and I use it as my camera standby now.  It's pictures seem as good as, and in some cases better than, my Canon Ixus 700.|#|Shutter is the only on/off button.  Only uses XD cards, but really minor points considering the cost.

10.0|#|I hve to say that I bought it for my wife, who seems very pleased with it.  From what I've seen of it, it appears to be excellent.|#|Pink.  It's very much a lady's camera (or thick-skinned man's).
10.0|#|All round great product - well worth buying if you want great pictures. I would suggest getting a large memory card though as the standard card won't hold that many decent pictures.|#|Quality reproduction of images that were taken using the zoom isn't as good as the superb quality of picture you get from not using the zoom
9.0|#||#|The slide has tendency to open if the camera is in a pocket and not in a camera pouch
9.0|#|Good slim design and easy slide access.|#|Non standard USB connection.   Too many features for simple user.
9.0|#|Size.  It is always in my pocket/It would always be in her handbag.  Fuji quality. 12million megapix. Superb macro. Intelligent auto setting. ISO 12800 (yes really).-  It can see in the dark.|#|None. Absolutely none.  I am very,very pleased with it.
10.0|#|Colours are very vivid, true and life like. Skin tones are excellent. I'm disabled and find i do shake a fair bit when holding objects but the image stablising  setting works like a charm. This is my first fuji and i think its a good camera for beginers and has some more advanced settings for intermediate users. I was a bit aprpehensive about the battery length because this model doesn't have a veiwfinder but so far its been fine. All in all im very pleased with quality and build with plenty of preconfigured settings.|#|Menu is a bit fiddly until you get used to it but its only a very minor point.
9.0|#|A good back up to my Canon 40d slr.|#|
8.0|#||#|(i.e straight lines at the edges of the frame become curved). If you test this camera, take a picture of a square tiled floor and you'll see what I mean. This is the worst feature in an otherwise excellent little  camera and why I didn't give it a 10 for image quality.
10.0|#|Over the past 10 years I have had a number digital cameras, and I can honestly say this is the best all-round camera.  I have ever had and I would recommend it to any one|#|I have not found any bad points with this camera
10.0|#|Lots of features, it is easy to use once you have got used to it, picture quality very good.|#|Just a bit confusing to find which photo selection to use to begin with, I found it some working out to actually delete the unwanted pic's, even after reading the instructions many times!
10.0|#|I bought this as a go anywhere camera to augment my DSLR Nikon D40x.  It has exceeded my expectations with some great photographs comparable to orhers taken with DSLR.  Great bateray life too!!!|#|None to note
9.0|#|So far, great pics.|#|None so far
8.0|#|Nice amount of features, options and shortcuts for alot of different scenarios. Brilliant zoom, and very fast startup for snapshotting.|#|A little bit bulky compared to most compacts. Although lots of features, alot of them yield similar results and overall seem pointless.
9.0|#|Superb image quality - good range of light levels -good range of features - excellent in low light levels which is where I do a lot of my photography|#|Wheel selection takes a little getting use to. Lots of settings takes time to learn. Basic paper manual - have to print out 163 page manual which you cannot do as compactly as the manufacturer.
10.0|#|If your looking for a shoot n point, your not going to be dissapointed. The zoom lever is for me anyway so easy to use, not having to take your eyes off the subject to use it. Macro, again for me, is super, then to be able to zoom in even more and to save the frame without loosing the original.|#|I'm sure that there may be one or two for the more discerning photographers out there, but again for me, I haven't found any that affect my personal experience with this camera.
10.0|#|A compact nicely made camera that a novice can use happily with enough features to keep a more serious photographer happy.|#|Some of the menus are not that intuitive.

9.0|#|Easy to use, and not complex considering how many features are packed in.  Compact and lightweight too. the large screen makes it a good point and shoot camera. Also not affected too much by direct sunlight on it; still easy to make out.|#|i am used to SLR'S so I find the powered zoom a little frustrating to get right for the picture.  zooms in and out too quick at times, and control is a bit fiddley. The battery life could be better, though I have obtained a spare from fuji so, that is not a problem now on all day trips.

After reading several reviews and taking the advice of friends I decided on the Fujifilm S1800.  I have found this camera easy to use, in fact easier than some point and shoot cameras.  It produces good quality photographs under a wide range of conditions.  Overall I am very satisfied with this camera.

The picture quality is superb.|#|Accessing some of the functions can be a bit fiddly and the camera doesn't cope well if you're taking lots of pictures in rapid succession

10.0|#|The picture quality is excellent and can be easily be set for for different conditions in which you are opperating - once set the settings remain until they are changed.|#|If using the anti-shake facility you really need to maintain the camera position for longer than normal after clicking the shutter.
8.0|#|The camera was a gift for parents.  I briefly used it when chatting through the controls - and it seems to be up to Fuji's usual standards.  Light, easy to use and good quality photos, for the price bracket.|#|Standard AA batteries is actually preferred by my parents (easy to carry replacements, cheap), but I would have preferred a standard Li-ion battery pack.

9.0|#|Lovely clear large 3 inch screen. Quick and easy to set up and start taking shots. Slim and compact for your pocket|#|Initially, the sensitive zoom button makes for a jerky action.
8.0|#|Its light weight,a nice camera comes with its own carry case(sold seperately)and its pink.|#|Its battery life is poor,it should be replaced with rechargeable batterys,i think its rediculous to have to pay so much for the camera in the first place and then have to constantly buy batteries for it

9.0|#|The camera is easy to use and for a compact camera focuses reasonably fast.With 5 times optical zoom and an internal lens system it is small and light enough to take anywhere. The battery life is good with approx 300 or more shots available on one charge. The dedicated video button makes taking video's quick and easy, and the ability to zoom while filming is a bonus.|#|Low light sometimes makes the auto focus struggle.
9.0|#|Easy to use, small and light. Lots of features.|#|Camera often comes on in bags or pockets bacause the cover will slide down when nudged. Lots of battery power lost in this way!

9.0|#|its very easy to use, and easy to load pictures onto my laptop. it looks great, and was great value for money.|#|the length of time it takes to take a picture once you've pressed the button; is a bit slow.
8.0|#|Ease of use. Picture quality. size|#|Battery/card cover does not lock positively. No pouch provided
8.0|#|The image qulity is good and easy to use camera.|#|For some uknown reason the flash must always go off twice. This si not the anti red eye feature as this makes it flash around 4 times before the picture is taken. So any time you use it in low light the camera flashes then flashes again to take the photo meaning a delay and therefore you mostly miss the action.
9.0|#|Good value for money|#|Lens cover too easily slides down when stored in consequence it can be switched on when encased in carrier

10.0|#|Ticking the boxes says it all!|#|
9.0|#|I bought this camera specifically because of the 15X optical zoom feature it has, and it really is good compared to cameras I've had in the past with 5X zoom.  The camera has point and shoot settings on it which will automatically take the best quality picture it can or if you prefer to select your own scene choice and iso etc the camera has a huge facility to do so.|#|The batteries that came with the camera lasted a very long time, however the duracell batteries I put in afterwards probably less than half that time, definately worth buying proper camera batteries.
10.0|#|Macro settings are uncanny! Photograph an insect on Super Macro and then blow it up (the photo, not the insect!) on the computer....Wow!|#|Haven't found one bad point yet.
10.0|#|very easy to focus and quick to change settings a great all-rounder my granddaughter just loves to take it away from me for her own use its that easy she is only 12 and takes great photos all the time|#|none that i can think of
10.0|#|I bought this for my wife who wanted a small but good quality camera. Having used compacts for years, she wanted something better, but not as big as my DSLR. This fits the bill perfectly, easy to use from point and shoot, through to fully manual, the range of zoom is excellent, and the image quality is surprisingly good even at maximum zoom.|#|I was surprised at the AA batteries, my previous experience of cameras with AA's has been the rate at which they get used up. So far though, it doesn't seem to be chewing through them as fast as other cameras.
9.0|#|3. The scene recognition setting makes it easier to get the pictures you want without fiddling with the other settings.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|easy to use, nice shape of camera makes it easy to hold, pics are brilliant, love zoom and panaramic pics, love the extra features|#|no bad points
9.0|#|The camera is quite balanced and easy to operate.   The 15x optical zoom is excellent and brings the object close up. The display for viewing photos is a good size in general.   The camera is very good value for money.|#|Showed low battery after around 120 photos.   I have purchased the recommended rechargeable batteries today and hopefully this will save buying batteries.

9.0|#|An excelent Range of features,the antishake mode the best i have seen. Good battery life.Light and easy to handle.|#|Movie mode spoiled by noise from the zoom motor
9.0|#|I liked the auto scene aplication. Ease of use. Took it on holliday recently and it produced some of the best photos I have ever done. I got stunning picures of the Alps and great portrate pics too. Very impressed.|#|Not much wrong with this camera
9.0|#|It's very easy to use, and good for first time photographers. If you like photography, but you're not really sure how to go about it; this camera is perfect for you!|#|My little sister couldn't find the battery display to show her how much battery she has left!
9.0|#|brilliant picture quality, even when you zoom in.|#|batterys dont last very long. a good idea to get rechargeable ones to save money.
9.0|#|It is simple and easy to use.|#|The continuous shooting mode does not work as well as my previous purchase of the Fuji FinePix S1500
10.0|#|excellent dialed options,really good zoom facility,I particularly liked the veiwfinder, (missing on some similar new camaras) ideal for focusing on moving objects.|#|I do not like the finish of the camara but I can live with it!.
10.0|#|usual fuji quality well made easy do use for the novice with auto facility or for rhe  more advanced  photagrapher using other features has a  super digital  zoom for close up photagraphy nwhich is very useful and thats why i bought the camera as it has everything you can use in a modern camera good value for the price.|#|Non as yet

9.0|#|the camera does everthing you could want it is easy to use , great pictures and good value|#|none
10.0|#|is very advanced.|#|When you turn the camera on to view your pictures the lens automatically moves out causing the cap to fall off. To be honest this is mildly annoying and is the only criticism I can think of!
9.0|#|i took this on holiday to monte carlo and it was great the panaramic shorts turned out great i liked the fact that the ladt part of the picture would become translucent so you could line up the next image so when stiched together they were seamless, other great features are the continuous shooting which you can set for 3 images or unlimited which is nice if you're looking for that once in a lifetime shot :)|#|night shoots are probably the only bad point, if the flash is on it somehow comes out dark (have not quite figured that out seeing as its a big burst of light!!!!!) and when you take the flash off the images come out bright and blured which is a real shame when shooting at night as i love taking night photos
9.0|#|Good value for money|#|limited amount of user guidance provided with the camera

9.0|#|Very easy to use and takes great photos|#|
9.0|#|Has a viewfinder - I cannot understand why all digital cameras don't have them as black screens on a sunny day render a camera not fit for purpose, so this was specifically why I went for this model|#|

8.0|#|Looks amazing|#|Screen should be able to twist laterally too. (To aid composition in portrait format in a high or low angle)
9.0|#|Excellent image quality. Amazing performance at high ISO settings. Very good value for money.|#|Focussing can be slow in low contrast situations. An eye-level viewfinder would be nice but adding this and improving the focus speed would greatly increase the price.
9.0|#|Noticeably smaller than the higher X series models and still handles very nicely - and I have big hands!|#|Appreciably 'cheaper feeling' due to slightly lower build quality compared to the higher models (and the X10 I upgraded from)

5.0|#|Good quality results|#|Compared to my previous Finepix550 this camera is very compact and difficult to handle as a result. Every control is really very small.  No viewfinder and not intuitive to use. Battery is dedicated to the camera so there is no chance of easy back up without buying another battery.
9.0|#|Bought for work use, so great that it is small and lightweight.|#|
8.0|#|Excellent camera which takes brilliant sharp pictures and is easy to use and has everything you want on it. Great zoom lense and good lcd screen. Great video, face detection, snap after snap, panaramic pics, it does it all if you want one small pocket size camera that is easy to handle and takes great pics this is the one. Lovely feel in your hand so easy to navigate around it. Great purchase.|#|Only one small problem, If you zoom whilst videoing it distorts the video and becomes blurred for a few seconds until it gets into focus again. So the video and zoom do not work well together. Great for videoing without the zoom. All in all an excellent camera.

10.0|#|Menus easy to navigate|#|
9.0|#|Does all it says, I have reviewed the red version. Excellent picture quality, very neat. On/off button can get pressed when opening the battery cover, needs downward and slide pressure to open.

10.0|#|I love the touch screen and viewing images is easy.|#|The pictures look better on the camera viewer.  When they are downloaded and viewed on my computer, the quality isn't so good.


10.0|#|so many good points|#|I haven't noticed any yet
9.0|#|The camera is sleek and sophisticated. The touch screen is very responsive and easy to use. There are lots of different modes and features, some I haven't even got around to using yet. The slideshow viewer is a fun easy way to flick through your photos and the collage creator is great as this then goes onto your computer as a separate photo and is great for making custom backgrounds!|#|Picture quality doesn't fantastic on the camera screen at first but it does sharpen up after a second or two and once on the pc (or mac in my case) the pictures look fab.
10.0|#|compact, touchscreen.|#|None
10.0|#|everything about the camera is right, I cannot fault it.|#|
9.0|#|Almost indestructable. Double lock mechanism on battery compartment. Battery charger and battery - awesomely compact. Features are brilliant particularly 360 degree panorama option.|#|A memory card and camera bag would have been nice to include in the price/box the camera came in as opposed to having to purchase seperately. I'm sure a deal can be struck with suppliers.
8.0|#|great little camera, fantastic idea with separate button for video recording - no more confusion, loaded with custom programs, good lookin'|#|none

9.0|#|easy to use,good picture quality|#|complicated menu when changing from point + shoot mode
9.0|#|Easy to use and picture quality is good for what I needed it for.  Basically just needed a camera for taking pictures on holiday and nights out etc and it does the job fine.  I wasnt looking to spend alot of money so this camera was perfect.|#|Batteries run out pretty quickly but still find it better than using a chargable battery as find you often get caught out when you dont have the charger with you/dont have anywhere to charge it.  So as long as you keep a supply of batteries with you, you will be fine.
10.0|#|for someone who just wants to aim the camera and take a picture,this is idea and it is so easy to use.|#|there is nothing bad about this camera,its well worth the money.

9.0|#|Excellent value for a budget digital camera, a good handy size for your pocket. An ideal beginers camera, easy to use, a good list of features and excellent image quality. I bought this for my grandaughter for Xmas and found it got better results than my own quality camera from a few years back!|#|Gets through the batteries quickly so carry spares.

8.0|#|Looks great, Size is great, and waterproof! Easy to use.|#|Picture quality is average to good, a lot of pictures have parts which are non clear.
9.0|#|For point and shoot it is good but when you grasp all the extra features it is really good.  Need practice with the panoramic shots.|#|The poorer element is when the sun is on the LCD screen as you wish to view the picture pre/after taking.
8.0|#|easy to use, clear instructions, on screen help.  good clear pictures.|#|
5.0|#|Easy to use and good picture quality. Panoramic setting good.|#|I returned this camera and requested a refund. The battery cover was flimsy. The batter meter was erratic and sometimes showed a low battery when it had just been recharged. Sometimes the camera 'froze' when turned on and all buttons were unresponsive; I had to wait a couple of minutes for it to turn itself off, then turn it back on and start again. Not satisfactory!
10.0|#|BOught for my 12 yr old daughter.  She loves it.  Easy to use and takes great photos.  Loves the colour too.  Couldnt be happier - so far.|#|

1.0|#||#|Camera never received so how can I review it!!
10.0|#|Fantastic little camera, light, stylish and easy to use for great quality photographs. Brilliant zoom before and after taking the photos. The only test now is time...|#|Little slow when flicking through pictures. However the positives outweigh the negatives by far.
9.0|#|Very easy to use, excellent picture quality.|#|Build quality - does not feel very robust.
8.0|#||#|none really for the price, nice and compact so just chuck it in your pocket and away you go!
5.0|#||#|Didn't actually use the camera because as soon as the camera was turned on it started ticking so sent it back the day after i received it
10.0|#|The picture quality is fantastic!|#|Sometimes the images have an orange tint, but this is few and far between!
6.0|#|It's small and lightweight, fairly ease to use once you get the hang of it. A decent, simple camera. Comes with FinePix Studio software.|#|The User Manual didn't work. It came on the same disc as the FinePix installation but it (the manual) wouldn't load at all, so I had trouble working out how to use the camera. Also it takes ages to focus when you're taking a photo and I often get blurry pictures. It comes with a lead for uploading but it's too short.
1.0|#|None|#|it didn't work out of the box! Bought as a Christmas present and made the mistake of not testing it beforehand - Christmas Day was a big anti-climax as a result.
10.0|#|I have not had the opportunity to use the camera often, but am delighted with those I have taken|#|Not really, but I think a camera pouch would be an asset.
8.0|#|The camera is very light and easy to use.  Many of the features of the camera and quality of photographs have been commented on by mant of my colleagues.|#|I was disappointed that the camera memory would only allow me to store a few shots.  I was unaware that I would need to purchase a memory card.  This caused some upset because I bought the camera for a specific purpose and could only take some photographs of the occasion.
10.0|#|so easy to use|#|none
9.0|#|good product|#|there is none
8.0|#|Compact little camera.|#|LCD display rather small.
10.0|#|easy to use,good picture quality|#|no syme card with it I had to buy one
9.0|#|Excellent 9M images. Best movie capture I've seen. RAW images open in Photoshop CS2 with Adobe's plug-in. Third party lenses available - handy wide angle. Takes AA batteries, which last pretty well too.|#|You've got to be picky to find fault with this camera: The manual focus is poorly implemented, but be honest how often do you use it? Disconnecting from a Mac before unmounting volume often corrupt card data (so don't do it and you'll be fine!).
10.0|#|Excellent feature set. The most comprehensive Digital Compact camera on the marget today. It has many of the features you would get on a low end Digital SLR and features expansion options.|#|The expandibiity option is a little on the steep price considering for example that you only gain an extra 1.94x zoom. If you want the best from this camera you have to read the manual...that is eiher a given to some or seems rather mundane to others.
6.0|#|compact|#|software a bit basic
6.0|#|Just what we wanted -  an easy to use camera that was a vast improvement on our 3 year old digital camera.  We especially liked the quick startup time and image quality.|#|None really.

9.0|#|Very well built with lots of features, very good for the price and comes with some very good software.|#|
9.0|#|Great for amateurs who want lots of features that they are used to on their SLR. Great for having 800 ISO. Great for fitting in a pocket and taking everywhere.|#|A compact is a only a compact however - the delay between pressing the release and the picture taking, will mean that you miss plenty of shots in the street that you would have captured with an SLR; autofocussing in low light is also an issue.
9.0|#|Large LCD.  Easy user interface|#|Bit limited
8.0|#|Very good image quality and very robust. After being left in snow after skiing and retrieved a day later, dropped in a night club and had water spilt on, it's still all in working order!|#|

9.0|#|This camera needs very little start-up time and has very good quality movie recording. There are manual modes of operation too, which allows for more precise photos. The colours and geometry of the images are excellent. It is lightweight and compact. Battery time is fantastic.|#|the power-on button is badly designed and allows for the camera to be switched on inside the leather case.
9.0|#|Good design, good image quality, compact and generally a pleasure to use.|#|No viewfinder.
8.0|#|Picture quality 2nd only to the Fuji f30 and battery life similar.|#|xd memory cards more expensive than sd or cf and not stocked by everyone.

8.0|#|Good quality pictures, very compact.|#|Only gripe is sometimes it is difficult to slide open front cover as fingers slip
10.0|#|small and sleak|#|no realy bad points concidering the size and price.. flash is a bit weak but then again for its size its great
8.0|#|Small, light and compact with good image quality. Easy to use and quick to respond|#|Needs cradle to connect via USB to computer. Would be better with direct mini USB socket on camera rather than bespoke Fuji socket.

10.0|#|compact, robust,easy to use. excellent for night's out flexiable enough for days out great little camera + fuji build and image quality i give it 10/10|#|Finger marks from above
9.0|#|This camera has a good compact design with a good size crisp display.  Good for quick snaps.|#|The menus and set up of the camera are fairly simple but has far too many features and settings for most users.
9.0|#|This camera is great in low level conditions. The battery is pretty good. It's a very handy size - no bumpt bits - so slips easily into a handbag or pocket. It's easy to use and has a lovely big screen.|#|The sharpness on the screen when you take a low level pic can be a little misleading when you come to print - but it's still good quality. The flash is a little too harsh, but I suppose it's the same with all digis.
8.0|#|very easy to use|#|provided memory card could be larger

8.0|#|Good picture quality. Movie mode very good. Very compact and portable. Both Mac and PC friendly. Low light mode very impressive.|#|Because of the size sometimes when taking a photo pressing the shutter button can cause some camera shake.
10.0|#|Very easy to use, excellent screen (even in bright sun). Good quality feel. Excellent battery life.|#|When using flash for potraits can give a lot of skin glare. I generally always leave the flash of as the camaera takes very good pictures in poor light without a flash.
8.0|#|Small, light, easy to use, good results|#|Initial memory (16 meg) much too low.
