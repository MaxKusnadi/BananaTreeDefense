You have to use a computer to download the user manual 389 pages  takes a little while to assimilate.

8.0|#|Incredible zoom; Excellent software and menus with easily understood text prompts for each feature; Light and small fits in a pocket with ease;  Have not rated image quality as I'v not had it long enough but initial results are very good.|#|Perhaps a little pricey. Spare battery definitely expensive at £25! Would have expected a dedicated charger at this price.
8.0|#|Versatility, picture quality good enough for any hobby photographer who doesn't need larger than a3 printing.|#|Needs practice to use all features, if no intention to use them may be better to by rugged point and shoot only.
10.0|#|If you want a point and shoot camera with a good optical zoom, this fits the bill. For the more creative enthusiasts, there is access to aperture/shutter modes of priority and full control of pre-focus.|#|Setting up direct printing via wifi and sending files to the pc proved a challenge to me but it is the first time I've used such facilities. The more savvy may not struggle as I did.
9.0|#|Amazing piece of kit. So light to carry and easy to use (or hard if you want to delve into all of the facilities and manual settings). I am used to using a 4/3 system SLR. People said, don't buy a compact superzoom because the cmos chip is too small....what a load of rubbish. If I were a professional I could see sense in going for a full plate type camera etc... but I'm not a professional. I win prizes in my local show and I am happy with this camera. It's sturdy and fast.|#|If it was waterproof and I could fit a polarising lens and the controls and viewfinder were a little bigger, it would be perfect. I'll have to manage. You have to be carefull that you do not bump the long lens, but that is the same for most cameras.

5.0|#|Has all the features you would expect and the remote operation from a phone or tablet is useful.|#|I have an earlier version of this camera and the build quality and materials used are so much better than this one. Consequently I am disappointed by the strange rubbery finish. Considering the price of this camera it should have a much better finish. In addition the screen is smaller than previous models.
10.0|#|As a travel camera this one seemed to be the most complete. Slightly more expensive than it's competitors but worth the extra money. I love the build quality and  how easy it is to use. Takes nice clear images on zoom. Easy to transfer images to pc. Lot's of other settings to play around with for more experienced photographers.|#|No bad points. You need make sure the wrist loop is on when handling it, especially when taking it out of a case to take a photo as it would be easy to fumble and drop. Manual view finder can be a bit fiddly and small but is a feature that is not available on other cameras in this category.
9.0|#|Works really well in low light conditions|#|Easy to get your finger over the flash
9.0|#|Nice sturdy case and always good to have a spare battery.|#|Shoulder strap that comes with case doesn't appear to have any attachment points on the case. Battery doesn't have a travel case so I've put it in a small sealable bag to stop keys or the like touching the terminals whilst in pocket/ bag. Older TZ camera battery came with a protective plastic travel case.
9.0|#|Relatively small and light weight for all the features. Fits in a pocket easily. Viewfinder great help in certain conditions. Tripod mount handy - mini tripod useful at x30 to aid stability.|#|Price dearest I've paid for a compact but plenty of features. Battery life seems low but probably no worse than other modern camera's.

7.0|#|Good 30x zoom range, good screen resolution and useful eye-level viewfinder.|#|It`s  complicated to use, menus are not as obvious as previous Lumix cameras. The user manual is 329 pages (just the English language version). I guess I will get the hang of it eventually!
8.0|#||#|Flash is hit 'n' miss when in Ai mode.  I was hoping that Ai mode was going to be a simple 'press and shoot' mode, but at a Christmas party it failed to flash 50% of the time and we ended up with lots of blurred images. I am sure there are ways around this, but its not 'smart auto mode' in my book if I have to disappear into menus or manual setup modes to cure issues like that.

9.0|#|Superb quality Leica lens. Camera is small enough to fit into hand yet has 30x zoom, 18mp and a viewfinder (the main reason I upgraded from my TZ8, as I couldn't see the screen well in bright sunlight).|#|Would like a separate battery charger to be included, similar to the one that came with my old TZ8.
9.0|#|Once programmed, the ring focus is good, and switches easily to a stepped zoom. The viewfinder is good in sunny conditions.

The photos are really good quality even with the lens on full zoom.  There are so many great features on it and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  I am an amateur photographer and I think it is just brilliant.|#|

9.0|#|A lighter weight camera that in many ways similar in handling to a DLSR, but with the convenience of keeping a camera by your side at all times.

9.0|#|Whilst sophisticated it is simple to use|#|No
8.0|#|Great zoom|#|The guidance manual runs to 250+ pages but the instructions are on a disc and this is useless when one is out in the field.

I would be happy to pay for the paper version but was denied the opportunity.

8.0|#|Fantastic zoom range and reasonably intuitive controls. Compact, light and easy to handle.|#|Viewfinder could have better resolution but apart from that, nothing of any consequence.
8.0|#|I bought the camera for its huge zoom capability and am delighted with it. The digital zoom does get a little fuzzy, but that is to be expected when you are up to ×120!|#|The overall build quality is no more than adequate.  My previous Sony bridge camera felt far more robust.

9.0|#|It is lightweight and produces good quality pictures. Really like the fact that it saves RAW files and has a limited ability to bracket a sequence of pictures.|#|It does not save RAW files when using the fully automatic setting.

9.0|#|A camera packed with features which produces excellent images and fairly easy to use.|#|Lack of an instruction manaual which has to be downloaded - over 200 pages! A proper view finder would be useful as the screen is poor in bright sunlight.
8.0|#|It is easy to use and responsive. The burst mode is handy for capturing images of my children, who move about very quickly, although many of the pictures end up being blurry because the camera does not have adequate time to focus.|#|None so far, but I've only had a the camera for a few weeks.

9.0|#|Every feature you would expect on a DSLR, but with the compactness of a bridge camera.  The 24-600mm (equivalent) Leica lens is fantastic, especially as you get f2.8 at every focal length.  The screen is brilliant and the electronic viewfinder also very good. The camera handles well, and the menus are easy to navigate. It has every type of shooting mode anyone could want, from scene modes to full manual control.  All in all an excellent camera.|#|It's heavier and bulkier than most bridge cameras due the f2.8 lens, and it's also more expensive than its rivals. The thumbwheel for adjusting the manual settings takes a little getting used to. However, none of these points should put the serious photographer off of buying.
9.0|#|F2.8 lens throughout zoom range. Excellent quality images for compact with small sensor. Zoom range. In camera editing features.|#|I'm used to the build of a mid range Nikon SLR so poor comparison but at this price, compromises have to be made. Not really a bad point, just an unfair comparison, really.
9.0|#|I used a SLR when birding but with a big lens hanging off it it got very heavy after a few hours. Also changing lenses in the field was not that easy. 2.8 apature through the range is amazing!|#|Not used it enough to comment.

8.0|#|Ease of use and fast lens allied to rapid start and focus.  Superb camera.|#|Image quality is not quite as good as I had expected - even after having two previous similar Lumix cameras - but it does take a satisfactory picture of things I've not been able to photograph before.
10.0|#|This camera oozes quality! It is really well made and intuitively learn how to use it and get the best from it. It is lighter in weight than a comparable DSLR with equivalent zoom lenses attached.The results are first rate in all light settings. It is a Best Buy Camera!|#|None to date
8.0|#|Lightweight. Very good substitution for your DSLR when you don't want to carry the weight around.

10.0|#|So easy to use good operating instructions|#|Citrus deal included a case which is no where big enough for camera ,filters etc
9.0|#|At its simplest it remains a simple point and press camera delivering high quality images. But it lives up to its promise of giving you the scope to be more adventurous and creative with your work. It may not meet the needs of the ultra serious DSLR user but then they wouldn't be looking at this camera. I am looking forward to continue my learning curve and discover just how much more i can get from the FZ200. I am really pleased with my buy.|#|I feel it remains a tad on the expensive side.

But the best function for me is the burst mode, this camera can take 10 pictures per second at great quality. I bought this camera to take pictures of my daughter showjumping and the burst mode is fantastic, I can get the perfect shot over every jump and unlike lots of the lumix's competitors the camera can be used while the shots are being written to the memory card making this a top choice for anyone wanting to regularly use the burst mode.|#|I cannot fault the camera at all.

I can think of no reason why I would ever use that. Perhaps a professional would but it would be better to be an optional extra and make the basic camera a bit cheaper

The movie feature is high quality in recording clear and colourful images.  It is very easy to use.  I used it for an African holiday and was thoroughly impressed with the 16 x zoom which can be extended to 21 x when editing photos.  Used it in wet, weather and it coped very well.  Sunny we|#|Big downside is no eye viewing option which means when the sun is bright (okay I suppose in Britain, but, it was very sunny in Africa!!) it is almost impossible to see anything on the large screen when you are attempting to zoom in on something or just ensure that what you are taking is really what you want.  Also the power indicator drops from 3 bar to zero very quickly and not in a steady run down.

9.0|#|excellent image quality. long optical zoom. good build quality. HD video is excellent.|#|In certain conditions when using a flash you may get a slightly dark bottom left corner caused by a shadow from the lens. This is due to the lenght of the lens and proximity of the flash. Easily fixed in photoshop. No printed manual this is an issue as there are alot of functions on this camera. slow/motion video is very low res to the point of being useless.
10.0|#|Like that you can take a still photo while videoing.  Very easy to use and picture quality excellent.  The battery seems to last quite a long time.|#|Only slight grumble is that you review your photos and switch off the camera it automatically goes back to the view mode rather than being able to take a photo straight away.  And I think that is probably the only bad thing I can find to say.

9.0|#|Had this camera for nearly a month. I'm no camera buff, but I'm very pleased with it. Still discovering its capabilities. Zoom is terrific and on max with image stabilization and hand held, results have been quite good. At a recent premier floodlit football match, action shots at the far end of the pitch on sport mode, resulted in some excellent shots. Some blurred some mediocre. . I like the GPS telling you where you are. Metal construction means it's robust. Screen is bright sharp and clear. Not had much chance to test in bright sunshine though. Easy to take movie by pressing different button. Means you don't forget which its set for. Also holds settings (ie date/time) for 24hrs whilst battery is out being recharged and forgotton !! Wife liked the scrolling description on screen when changing scene modes and other helpfull setups. All in I think this camera is brilliant.|#|Possible to take pictures by tapping sceen, usufull, but I've not noticed it set and taken a lot of pictures of the inside of my jacket pocket !!!

It was a replacement for an earlier model which got chewed by the dog and I was a bit concerned about the reported poor light performance (I use the camera for industrial shots of failures and accident scenes which are often in poor light) but there is no evidence of this and the camera works perfectly in all lights tested so far.|#|Sat Nav is still a bit slow and the menus unclear but this hasn't affected my use of the camera at all.

Can be used as just a point and shoot camera but the options are there to be very creative.|#|I find myself having to keep referring to the instruction booklet or camera magazine reviews in orderf to turn off or on certain functions. I do not like the touch screen shutter release function and i havent yet found out how to disable it. Operating instructions do not do the camera justice as there is a lot more to this camera than at first meets the eye.

9.0|#|, the lens aperture and the LVF are what does it for me, and I don't  think I'll ever leave the house without it.|#|The price is quite high, despite its brilliance; but to be honest, if the tele went up to100mm, this would the perfect camera.
8.0|#|Small size. Good quality lens. Very easy to quickly adjust shutter speed and/or aperture. The many features it has, including the horizontal and vertical level indicators and wi-fi.|#|Limited zoom range.
9.0|#|Simple Menus bars and image quality|#|Connecting to computer remotely etc - way too complicated considering how easy Panasonic have made the basic and advanced principles of digital photography for the amateur.

10.0|#|Really good looking peace of kit. Compact enough to put the camera with 20 mm lens in pocket. Image quality is really good. And also it is packed with features.|#|I gues only the price is bit high.

10.0|#|Great options for video at a good price|#|


9.0|#|The FX500 is the best compromise between image quality and features. Full manual exposure, aperture priority and shutter priority modes give you full control over exposure and makes low light shooting easy. The touch screen works very well although can be fiddly at times. High def videos turn out great...just make sure you have a high speed high capacity SD card! One of the best point-and-shoot alternatives to an SLR.|#|Missing manual focus and the ability to zoom while in movie mode. Takes a long time to process long exposure shots. Bad points FAR outweighed by the good.
9.0|#|Basic functions useable straight from the box|#|As with most modern electronic items, a thorough reading of the manual is necessary to achieve the best results.
10.0|#|Pretty easy to use if you want to choose your own settings. If you don't the camera selects everything for you. Great quality of images. The manual is a bit complicated to read through, but once you get the hang of it, the camera is a dream.|#|If you want to take quick pictures - increasing shutter speed, you can't use the flash. Doesn't come with a bag - which needs to be bought separately.

9.0|#|light weight, excellent wide angle lens, Intelligent Auto mode is great, sharp pictures with good exposure, even with flash, touch screen interface is very intuitive and useful. Variety of exposure modes including fully manual. Large screen.|#|Zoom motor is a bit clunky, joystick button a bit hit-an-miss to operate, battery/memory card cover seems a bit flimsy and has to be locked shut manually. Not the fastest to focus and take photo but a lot better than many.
9.0|#|Easy to use, excellent image quality which is what it's all about.  LCD screen is large and okay in bright light.  Fits perfectly and unnoticeably in a pocket so it's no trouble to take around.|#|Although menu controls have shortcuts to various options, the buttons are small and it can be easy to go into the wring option and have to back out, just when that photo opportunity goes by!  Sometimes with bright light source coming into the lens, the final image quality is a bit grainy.  This may be typical I don't know. Little to complain about overall though.

8.0|#|Dont be put off by the low pricepoint - its been replaced by the FX550, which comes with one or two extras at a substantially higher cost. Its features are still very much up to date. If you're out for a bargain - this one is not to miss! I bought it on simplyelectronics for less than 2/3rds of its original  price.|#|

10.0|#|! ...Can't be bad!!!|#|The only bad point I can think of is trying to eliminate the light reflections (not sure if thats the best way to describe them!) you get on the picture when taking a photo at night - I found them to be especially bad on the auto setting - however when I changed to the night setting they weren't as bad.

7.0|#|This is a very stylish and slim camera that easily fits into your pocket. It has many features, a very useful one being the Intelligent auto-focussing where it follows the object around and keeps it in focus. it also is a very fast shooting camera, ready to shoot on turning it on quickly and ready to shoot between shots quickly.|#|I have two main issues with this camera: 1) It does not always seem to focus (in picture and video mode) too well. 2) This camera is not the easiest to use. Choosing different modes and features, playing videos ... the menu is not that obvious and you find things in places where you would not expect them to be. I have had to read instructions more than I would normally do to be able to work the camera.
9.0|#|Very quick startup, sharp image, small handy size and smart looking.|#|No cover for lens.

9.0|#|As a retired professional photographer, I wanted a small compact to fit in my pocket as a fun travel camera. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ10 fits the bill perfectly and is packed with features that far outweight it's price. It's very easy to use once one has become familiar with it's various operating modes and for a small compact it's response is very fast, so that you don't miss a shot  waiting for a slow auto-focus to kick-in.|#|Flash is off-centre and so produces a shadow behind the subject - would be better if it was directly over the lens.
9.0|#|Incredible camera for price range.  This camera is so easy to use.  It has an easy straight forward menu on the LCD screen.  Nice to be confident that almost every picture will be sharp and in focus.  Intended to save up for expensive digital SLR camera, but I have no need for that now.  I personally think  (I am an amateur photographer) that this camera is capable of producing professional prints for us.|#|However I was using the burst frame in menu and had taken around 250 photos
10.0|#|The image quality if fantastic and video is awesome,  the focusing it great and the micro option is truely amazing picking out the finest of detail, the tz10 feels like a quality product and would instantly recommend it to a friend.|#|Being a new product on the market you would expect it to support new sdhc cards, but I have a class 6 8gb sdhc card and the video will only work in the lowest quality, but not in super high quality, you get an error message to this effect on turning it on, although everything else appears to work fine, I have tried a class 4 sdhc card and this works fine, so something to watch out for! Also a tad pricey, (but in this case you do get what you pay for)

This camera is excellent quality and feels substantial.  It has many functions which I haven't yet explored.  The picture quality is excellent, and once camera is set up which is very straight forward its just point and shoot.  Brilliant lens, and zoom.  The battery seems to have a long life also.|#|

9.0|#|All the good things I'd heard about the TZ10 are true, it's build quality and features are excellent and the large screen makes framing easy.

9.0|#|Very good zoom, GPS is very good when travelling, easy and quick to use as the controls are dials rather than just software buttons|#|GPS uses battery so it needs to be charged regularly when GPS is left on, cannot charge battery without removing it from camera.
10.0|#|Great buy.|#|None!
9.0|#|Its High Dynamic scene setting is really good!!!  and the colours are bright and saturated.  Really happy with the camera.|#|
9.0|#|malarky. The video quality is awsome! The ammount of detail you can pick up in some pictures is soo good, i swear this camera can see better than my eyes.|#|when looking really closely at the pictures, some things seem to take on an almost oil painting quality. I'm not sure what causes it, but it doesn't take away from the image quality very much at all, especially at the resolution of picture this camera takes.
10.0|#|Excellent image quality. Very easy to use.|#|
9.0|#|Good zoom lens|#|Image quality poor in low light
9.0|#|Excellent quality pictures, and a good range of features.|#|GPS runs battery down quickly and is not really a useful function.
9.0|#|Telephoto lens; compact; flexible operation; features; I use this as my second, compact camera to a semi-pto SLR|#|Viewer needs a Delkin screen in sunlight - most compacts suffer from this.
9.0|#|Excellent product, the 4th panasonic camera I have owned. A bit bulky but has GPS and things get smaller all the time. Great  HD movie quality. A bit disappointed that it doesn't automatically link up with i-photo still events as it did before on my Apple macbook.|#|I have yet to find any manufacturer of any product that produces really clear 'how to use' instructions.
10.0|#|I brought this for my daughters birthday/Christmas present and all I can really say is she is absolutely thrilled with it.  She constantly goes on about how clear it is, how easy to use it is, the great gps etc. etc. My dad's always done photography and knows a lot about camera's and he agrees, says it's an excellent little camera.|#|I've not heard a single bad point!
9.0|#|Strong case, but lightweight and compact. Easy to use with great clarity.|#|
9.0|#|I haven't used this very much yet but from what I've seen so far I'm really impressed. Image quality is amazing and the zoom really works. I saw some shots taken at a gig by a TZ8 and that's what inspired me to buy the 10. Not sure if the GPS thing is useful or just a bit of tech you don't need. I bought it for the zoom and the pixels and both are spot on. I purchased a spare battery for it as well.|#|
9.0|#|Point and shoot mode works very well.|#|Charger cable a little on the short side.
9.0|#||#|Viewing the screen in bright weather, which of course is the norm for all digital compact type cameras.
9.0|#|Sharp pictures, HD video very clear. Great zoom. Nice and compact. Loaded mine with a 16 gig data card, which can be greater capacity if necessary.|#|Proprietary usb cable will cause a problem if lost.
8.0|#|One touch HD video, you can turn off the GPS tagging and save battery, large screen and wide aperture lens for a compact.|#|GPS tagging uses too much battery, menus can be a little involved.
10.0|#|For a keep in the pocket; point and shot camera it is excellent. Good Zoom, quick focus, reasonably good in low light conditions, quick start-up, Image stabilisation on zoom is good, HD recording quality was better than expected. GPS may be gimmicky, but I am sure over the years, the GPS tagging on the photos will help you work out where a particular photo was taken.  Oh, not forgetting; the 25mm ultra-wide-angle lens is brilliant for getting everyone in the shot|#|GPS does drain battery when not in use, so if you don't use regularly, either turn GPS off, or ensure you charge the battery before going out.. Also if you are snap happy, a spare battery is going to be a must for those days out.
10.0|#|Have not tried or used the GPS function yet, and wonder if I ever will, but that is a personal choice. Also yet to try the movie mode, which could be of invaluable use in the future.|#|Not found any
10.0|#|Really good and it takes really good photo's|#|have not got any bad point's
8.0|#|I cannot fault the basic use of the camera as applied to it in the very small start up booklet that comes with it.|#|There are many features that are impossible to use without the aid of a comprehensive guide.  The operational manual is contained on a disc.  Panasonic have overlooked the simple fact that when away from home it is impossible to consult the disc with out previously spending hours on a computer trying to download the appropriate pages from the disc.  I have spoken Customer Services as was informed that they no longer print a manual to save paper!!!  This is a nonsense as much or more paper is required to download 173 pages of instruction from the disc.

9.0|#|Fabulous optics with good stabilisation|#|Can't think of any
9.0|#|Lovely looking camera. Easy to hold. I am only using it as a point and shoot camera at the moment so not using all the features. I have turned off the GPS as I didn't really want to use this feature but it is there if I ever need it. I haven't printed any photos yet, only looked at them on the pc but they seem very good.  I have used various modes on the scene section and they seem fine. I don't seem to get much red eye at all.|#|None that I have found yet.
8.0|#|It takes good photographs.|#|The instruction manual is over 176 pages long. It has many ptrobably unused features.
9.0|#|This camera has surpased my expectations and is a real point and shoot camera that takes great pictures.  It is easy to operate and for the novice like me means I can take decent photos without too much fiddling with features.|#|It is fairly bulky for the type of camera it is so isnt really pocket size but apart from that I love it!
10.0|#|i love this camera why... well i had a small cannon and dropped it once and it broke.. this is the second lumix  i had the build of the camera is fantastic... the first one i had dropped once and in sand another time and it worked.... i gave it away to a mate as i wanted to upgrade and my mate dropped it yikes and it works.. but the reason i like it is the features... the grainy black and white is brilliant.. i am  a photographer and a compact like this is nice to point and shoot. with  a leica lens easy to use and good colours i am hooked..|#|
9.0|#|Excellent build quality. Super zoom lense. Great flexibility of programs whilst also offering a vast range of auto functions.  The slow zoom in HD movie mode is impressive as is the GPS system when used properly.|#|Battery life seems rather short. It is important to turn GPS off when not in use. AF can take a while to catch up when zooming in movie mode in low light conditions.  Accompanying software is not as easy to use as expected.

8.0|#|The TZ10 is my second Lumix camera so knew what to expect - excellent image quality and good features.   Slightly heavy for me after my previous camera - the FX07 which is the same size as the LCD screen on the TZ10.|#|Panasonic don't include a camera pouch/bag, and the accessories are very expensive.
9.0|#|Very good quality pictures. Whilst there are quite a few buttons and options which you might use if you know more about camaras than me, once you put it in automatic its quite easy to use.|#|GPS drains the battery but i just turned it off, then it was fine!

9.0|#|Easy to use (fully automatic), or very flexible if you have more time.|#|Panasonic software is hopeless, often does not register the existence of pictures on the camera (so be careful if formatting the SD card).  Use something else (Canon software we have for an Ixus is much better)

10.0|#|to give it to her - thats why I had to buy a new Panasonic Lumix and this time the new TZ10. It´s amazing that a compact camera includes so many features: great wide angel 25mm, real optical 12x zoom and last but not least video in HD quality with great sound. I have not yet experienced all the new new features such as GSP and all the manual settings, but the IA-mode works very well for me. More than 90 percent of all pictures taken in IA-mode.|#|Cannot think of any - perhaps except that the menu languages are only in exotic languages and of course in English, but no other European Languages i.e. Danish :-D

9.0|#|Good lens: wide angle to 12x optical zoom, and very stable at max zoom.  Good battery life.|#|Slighty larger and heavier than previous Panasonic but thats due to range of lens.

9.0|#|A very easy camera  to use|#|A bit pricey
10.0|#|Best camera on the market for me! I had the TZ 3 for some time and found it to have superb quality features and pictures and this one tops that .  Once you have read the instructions and got yourself around all the features it  has you won't find a better camera. A * in my opinion|#|

10.0|#|.  The image quality is superb and the vast array of features are easily accessed with the menu systems.|#|I had to replace the carabiner (used to attach to a belt) because it opened too easily when it was not intended to (inoperative spring).
9.0|#||#|Definitely need a second battery when you're away from home. Especially if you work the GPS
9.0|#|scene setting resulted in excellent video and stills - even in murky water. On-screen menus are clear and it's easy to see what you can do on each screen, as a handy guide is shown that details all possible functions within a given screen. The camera is light but feels very sturdy and well made. Instruction booklets are easy to follow and the bundled PhotoFunStudio software is excellent for converting the video to MPEG2.|#|The GPS function uses up the battery even when the camera is switched off. This is mentioned in the instructions but there's no guide as to how much battery is used. Ensure this function is disabled between uses and you'll avoid nasty surprises!

10.0|#|Takes absolutely beautiful photos with minimal effort - and that's without exploring all the extended features.|#|Nothing really, although there is so much to learn to get the most out of this camera and to do that you have to use the CD manual which is not so easy when you're in Spain without a computer to hand!
9.0|#|Great zoom|#|Panorama mode could be better
9.0|#|As a purely point and shoot photographer, this camera does all I ask and more besides. The autofocus and auto exposure modes are great for me as they give me good pictures without trawling through menus and settings.|#|Not sure what the point of the gps is
10.0|#|I was really interested in this camera as it has a Leica lense. and I always buy on the quality of the Lense, without it you dont stand a chance  It is of course an up to date camera, so the modern features are pleasing|#|Not really interested in GPS

Still nice to have GPS in a travel camera.

9.0|#|I am personally delighted with TZ10 camera and can't fault it, but i'm not an expert in cameras or photography. I was looking  for a camera that would take a good photo and auto set its self, and fit in my pocket and take hardly no more space than a mobile phone. I dont really see myself as being qualified to rate it. thats why I have not given no 10 point scores|#|

8.0|#|The picture quality is just great and the zoom (x12) makes outdoor long range shots esay to take. The features are simply to use and it has everything the average user will ever need.|#|The software supplied has been problematic. I run windows 7 and have found it to be unstable on this platform. I also find the software is poor in terms of how you view the pics and print them. My last camera was a basic fuji and the software was far better.

Love this camera, so easy to use just point and click - brill...|#|My only concern is that not being a photo buff found that it has lots of settings and haven't really got enough time to sit and read through the manual for 2 or 3 hours so i'm probably not using it to it's full potential.

10.0|#|I previously had borrowed a family member's Panasonic Lumix TZ-3 or 4 and really liked the menus and how easy everything was to find and use; plus the all important picture quality is top notch for this range of camera. Having read lots of different reviews, I decided on the TZ10 over a Ricoh, Sony, or Nikon etc. All-in-all I cannot fault this camera.|#|The AVCHD Movie mode is not as accessible as it could be although the HD quailty is fantastic; however the alternative JPEG Movies provide me with quailty at a good enough level for my needs.

Many, many options (which can be a good thing) so trying to find the setting to change can be tricky as you wander throught he setting.... Some of the metering can overexpose objects.

Either I haven't got to grips with the GPS, or it only provides a very simple stamp of where you took your photo near to - I was envisaging that you could view this on google maps similar to iphone photo GPS tags.

7.0|#|Has plenty of features|#|Quite a long delay from the point of pressing the photo button and the image being taken resulting in possibly missing the shot wanted. I found it rather complicated to work out the different features and the instruction booklet was very limited.  Flash photography has not been very successful
9.0|#|Amazing zoom and excellent quality of photos.|#|Feels a bit old-fashioned, but actually, this means the controls and on/off button are really solid and stay in the mode you set.

10.0|#|Fantastic camera and perfect for my ability and usage. I wanted to be able to take high quality shots on my Year Abroad in Andalucía, and so far it hasn't disappointed. Takes great night shots, no blur, no dullness as with my old Nikon Coolpix. The 20x zoom is amazing and the camera takes great HD movies. The autofocus macro mode is my favourite feature. I haven't got to grips with all the camera's features yet but so far it's proved a worthwhile purchase!|#|None so far!

10.0|#|This is the second Panasonic camera I have bought and they just get better.|#|If there is any bad points it might possibly be it weighs a little heavier, but that is of little consequence in relation to the quality of the camera overall.
8.0|#|Very light with amazing zoom for its size.  Love the panoramic photo feature.|#|My previous Lumix 'felt' nicer being more metallic and with more tactile buttons etc.  Also had more and better pre-set 'Scene' options.  This one has Baby 1 and Baby 2 (no use to me at al) but no 'Beach' or 'Snow' for bright days.

8.0|#|On a recent holiday to India it was a real advantage and 'crowd-puller' particularly amongst children who were thrilled to see the pictures I'd taken of them.  The next stage for development would be an integral facility for instant printing (a bit like the old Polaroid).|#|One minor ciriticism is that the Menu Set and 4 surrounding controls get in the way of my thumb (and activated) when taking a picture.  This is probably just because I'm not used to it yet.
9.0|#|Solid feel to camera and follows panasonic's previous 'easy to use' symbols even though it is a technological breakthrough in terms of magnification for this type of camera (compact).|#|None

9.0|#|is fantastic to be able to really see what your taking a photo of and the ability to adjust the screen settings makes it usful for if the sun is shining bright behind you (you are still able to see the screen on the correct setting) and and high angle view makes it brilliant for take photos above your head for example at a concert|#|software for transfering photos is slow and difficult to use.  the camera has a lot of features which to benifit from them all requires a very long reading session of the instruction manuel.  The OIS feature on the camera is not so good and i've found that if a subject moves even a little it doesn't adjust like advertised. the Intelligent ISO doesn't achieve very good results and you end up manually changing the settings to get the best results.

9.0|#|I replaced a Kodak digital camara which I liked but it was bulky. This camera does all that it did and more and is slim. apart from the all the features I purchased on slimness and it does a great job.|#|One bad point and I knew it before I purchased.  It has no viewfinder which is a barmy idea. You cannot see your subject in sunlight. it becomes guesswork.
8.0|#|Generally easy to use, great LCD display, quick to start up, good control and shutter speeds, easy to hold, well built and good looking.|#|No ability to zoom whilst using video, excessive noise from internal microphone whilst using video, doesn;t rotate picture view according to camera orientation on playback (but I think this is a minor / gimmick issue).
9.0|#|large screen, good zoom. loads of features and good value.|#|
10.0|#|Really good build quality with an excellent LCD screen to review and edit pictures before saving. The picture quality is excellent and it is very easy to use, the controls simple and well laid out. The digital x40 zoom feature is absolutely amazing and allows you to get close-ups from a distance. Connection to a PC to backup pictures is also very easy. I would also recommend the LEXAR 2GB card with this, stores over 600+ high resolution pictures! technology has come a long way since the old method of sending a film off and getting prints of variable quality.|#|The battery does not seem to retain its charge as long as an earlier Sony 7.2M Cybershot camera which used to go several weeks of usage between charging - that said the battery does last a few days of use which is adequate. Another minor point is that I do not like having to remove the battery from the Panasonic DMC-TZ3 in order to charge it - the Sony had a very convenient power plug on the camera.
9.0|#|SIMPLE  TO USE... SMALL... LOTS OF FEATURES... GREAT LENS MAKER (LEICA)!|#|NONE REALLY...
9.0|#|Amazing features for a reasonably compact camera, especially the 10 x optical zoom and image stabiliser.  Very comfortable to handle.  Very versatile and takes great pictures in a variety of scenarios.  Fantastic LCD screen.|#|Takes some effort to get realistic colours in automatic ISO Mode and some Scene Modes e.g. sunset.  Microphone is a bit weedy but that's probably to be expected for a secondary feature on a compact.  Need to buy a memory card straight away - the internal memory is tiny.
10.0|#|The optical zoom is superb.  The quality of the video function.  The large screen at the back and the fact that there is no delay when taking the picture.  Also, the fact that it takes quality picture without having to be a large clumsy camera.  It is small enough just to slip into your pocket on holiday etc.|#|

8.0|#|The build quality is very good, the 10 x optical zoom is very useful although camera shake is a bit of a problem at the top end. The camera is loaded with enough features to keep most users happy. The ability to use the camera above head height and still see what you're taking. Size is excellent.|#|The amount of choice you get to take a photo can be a bit confusing. It has taken quite a while to get to grips with the different settings and just when I think I've got it, I take a photo and it turns out to have a blue colour through it. This is especially annoying when you are taking candid photos that can't be repeated. The battery life is also poor, I am considering buying another battery to keep topped up.
10.0|#|Small and compact, 10 x optical zoom is fantastic, it does everything you need plus it fits in your pocket and gives fantastic quality pictures.  Unbelievable for such a little camera.  You can't go wrong with this one.|#|Cant think of any bad points.

This is especially true when in bright sunny conditions, however I have not let this put me off and I have many excellent photos as a result.

I am very happy with all aspects particularly the solid feel of it (it feels a quality product), the images are clear, the printing true and the anti-shake feature is invaluable - and works. It's nice to buy something and realise that you actually made the best choice for once!|#|Mine didn't come with a case but that's all I can think of in the bad point department.

Very easy to use menu system to access the many features and a useful 'quick access' button the get to the most common options which you might need to access frequently. Large and clear screen.|#|Need to have a very steady hand when using the zoom lense on a high zoom setting, otherwise pictures can easily come out blurred, but then this would be the same with any camera with a powerful zoom.

10.0|#|Easy to use. Fantastic quality photography|#|
10.0|#||#|Button on top seems a little flimsy
10.0|#|Having researched before purchasing I had been recommended to get more optical zoom on a camera rather than higher resolution. 8.1mp is more than enough for any personal photography. The camera is easy to use. It is slightly bigger than a lot of compact digital cameras but for 10x optical zoom you can understand the need for this. Also the video quality is really good, records at NTSC 30fps. I purchased a 8gb memory card which allows for more than 1900 photographs at highest resolution.|#|

8.0|#|shooting is a breeze. The image stabilisation is the main reason I bought this, though. Picture quality is fine (much as I'd expect from a Lumix).|#|Not the most user-friendly of instruction books - sometimes a product can do too much!
9.0|#|Small and light enough to fit in your pocket and yet extremely versatile with the 10 times zoom facility. The perfect camera for everyday use.|#|The tripod fitting point is at one end of the camera. Consequently when trying to use it with my mini tripod, the camera easily topples over.

10.0|#|I have worked my way up to this product from 3 pixels to 7 to now. I think it is super and being very mature myself and a bit forgetful I like the idiot proof basic features and I learn the others as I go along. I have become a very good photographer if I say so myself!|#|None,  any problems were operator error at setting up.
7.0|#|Wide angle lens|#|Using the auto intelligent mode, any movement causes blurring which I've never experienced with any Canon Ixus camera I've ever owned so I am very disappointed with this.  Other than that it's OK, though not very straightforward to use.
9.0|#|Close-up (macro) picture quality is very good. Very compact and light. Face detection and anti-shake fuction are helpful. 25mm wide lens is very handy when you take group photos.|#|Very awkward to adjust the zoom scale (it's OK if you want either close-up or zoom-in). For the money spent, it should come with tele-lens more than 4x optical.
9.0|#|Excellent point and shot.|#|Haven't come across major or minor to grumble about

7.0|#|widescreen lens is good|#|could have had a barger zoom
9.0|#|I would go as far as to say it's almost a mini, pocketable SLR in terms of use and results.  It gets far more use that my DSLR!|#|For some people, the maximum zoom may not be enough at 2.5 times (60mm).
10.0|#|An exceptional camera, the reviews I read all pointed to this being an excellent piece of kit and I am not disappointed. If you want a small camera with full manual control this is the one for you!|#|shot outweigh the small zoom in my opinion.
9.0|#|Lovely looks and solid-feeling metal body.|#|Battery cover is a bit flimsy, hasn't caused me any problems in a month's use but you wouldn't want to drop it while the cover was open in case it snapped off.
9.0|#|Build quality; flexibility of controls (menus and buttons); range of controls that provide a good deal of artistic input to the imaging process; image orientation is recorded; image quality is superb. Video quality is good. Battery charger is compact and convenient.|#|All very minor quibbles: did not include a case, wrist strap (there was a neck strap) or memory card; the manual was a terse reference manual; the tripod mount is off center. Note that the white balance performance can be improved by a firmware update.
9.0|#|Good to have the 24mm (35mm equiv) focal length for landscapes|#|
10.0|#|Decent bundled software for handling RAW images.|#|
9.0|#|Handles very well. Excellent wide angle lens, Plenty of features and above all excellent quality photos for a compact.|#|Lens sticks out a bit so harder to slip in your pocket.
9.0|#|Manual control, long exposure facility, rapid multishot, HD video. Also a great point and shoot when you want.|#|It goes in your pocket but doen't leave room for anything else.
9.0|#|Excellent manual handling through menus and the joystcik but the Intelligent Auto programme is really very good so you can use the camera in point and shoot mode with confidence.  While the optical range of the lens is only x2.5 (24mm to 60mm equivalent)/ F2.0 to 2.8 that is more than adequate for my needs. It shoots in RAW too.  Overall I am very happy with it.|#|The screen is hard to use in sunlight, (see above).  Lack of a wrist loop.  (The camera comes with a strap but no wrist loop so I have had to swop one from another camera).
10.0|#|Superb quality photos for such a small camera.  Great range of controls available and RAW files if wanted.|#|Small zoom range, but worth putting up with for the plus points above.
10.0|#|This camera is absolutely gorgeous. It's been nearly 5 months since I bought it and Im still enjoying using it.The image quality is superb, it's user friendly and build quality is 9 out of 10. The only weakness I see is the battery. If you buy this camera, you might want to buy an extra battery as well.|#|
10.0|#|take images. go on spoil yourself you wont be dissapointed.  The only downside is that I would have really liked to have a viewfinder, I know i will get used to composing the image viewed from the screen but the `normal` viewfinder way is so natural.|#|No real bad points. a viewfinder would make it the perfect digital `leica` replacement.
9.0|#|Fine lens performance (Leica Summicron). Image stabilizer. Compact design. Large, brilliant screen. Fast, responsive control. Quiet operation. Low image noise at lower ISO settings. Good quality movies. Battery life very good.|#|ISO settings buried in menu system. Screen (as in common with similar cameras) can be difficult to view in bright conditions. Noise can be an issue at the higher ISO settings.
10.0|#|4. Good design and build quality|#|2. It's not a bad point, but using all the possibilities of LX3 requires some photographic knowledge.
8.0|#|I bought this camera for times when I did not want to use my bigger DSLR. It is compact,  well made and fits into my pocket but it is over priced. The camera does not have a viewfinder and to purchase an external one to go with the camera is very expensive. The facility to take RAW pictures is good and they can be viewed in Photoshop Elements 8 only (none of the earlier versions work) or you can use SilkyPix which comes with the camera, strangely this software is only good for viewing RAW but will not display any JPG pictures you may have taken with the camera, it is quirky software but seems to be quite effective in photo manipulation.|#|The lens cap is its worst feature. On most digital compact cameras the lens retracts into the body of the camera when it is switched off, on the LX3 it retracts but you then have to physically fit the lens cap on otherwise the lens remains exposed and it can be scratched as there is no facility to put a Skylight filter on which would protect it. I was out taking street shots just after buying the camera and it was only when I got home I noticed that a lot of pictures were partially out of focus. What had actually happened was that I had touched the lens with my greasy fingers and because it was such a bright sunny day I could not see the pictures clearly on the screen, careless, yes, but it happens. Finally the zoom is only 2.5 which is not very good.
10.0|#|Very good quality of pictures with regards to the compact category of the camera. Many various functions for amateur and/or semiproffessional photographer. Possibility to use a RAW picture format.|#|Very good lens speed can cause issue when you take pictures in strong light environment - e.g. snow in the moutains. Min. ISO value 80, Max. aperture 8.0 and shutter time 1/2000sec. needn't be enough in that conditions.

9.0|#|A compact but powerful camera, I have found myself taking far more great shots simy because I'm not afraid to take it everywhere unlike my DSLR which seems to sit at home. The camera offers a wide range of adjustability great for playing around. The quality of build is top notch and feels solid, just like the cameras of old which inspired is clasic asthetics.|#|A little on the expensive side for some, and can take a little while to process long exposure shots, but only a small niggle at best. Can produce slightly noisey results if your used to a DSLR standard but is what you expect for a more compact design.

7.0|#|Can't compare to a good DSLR,but it certainly puts most of those other point and shoot cameras to shame.I also like the mild retro look of it as well,although the end result (the picture quality ) is what counts.|#|Bad points,the only one I have encounted so far, is short battery life. Haven't had it long enough to rate it in any other area.Will have to get back on that one.
9.0|#|Great fast lens. Great image quality. Great handling and build quality - menus are so intuitive that when it arrived set up for Japanese I managed to succesfully change the language to English!|#|Shame not a little more zoom. A little bulkier than expected as the lens doesn't retract fully - and lens cap is a bit of a faff but it's the same with a dslr.

10.0|#|Superb video performace with creative capabilities that are impossible to achieve with a camcorder.|#|
9.0|#|Excellent camera, good value for money considering the kit lens and full HD video capabilities. Well made, practical size and easy to use. HD video results are impressive as is image quality once you master the settings.|#|Very few... Takes a while to get decent results using AVCHD video format, but worth making an effort to get a decent work-flow set up, as the end results are very impressive. Also need to fiddle with a the various settings to get decent image quality, but thats more a question of my knowledge of photgraphy rather than an issue with he camera. The price... its expensive. But considering everything it can do (in the right hands) and the excellent kit lens, its decent value for money.
9.0|#|Good camera... does what it says in the adverts. Good quality electronically. Easy to use. I really like the flip-n-tilt view finder.|#|Expensive, but does what I wanted very well. Some buttons look a little fragile. No AVCHD video viewing or editing software. Errr... the USB lead is quite short.
9.0|#|Low light photography even at ISO 3200 is acceptable.  I don't envisage parting with this for a long time and will definitely get the 7-14mm zoom too.|#|It doesn't come with a high definition tv cable - unbelievable.

10.0|#|Features of an S L R  and the ease of use of a compact|#|
9.0|#|The GH1 produces very good photos as well as great video. The ISO may not go as high as some DSLRs but even so, it's enough for me with great pictures up to ISO 800 which I find more than enough. The kit lens is a cracker - but it should be for the price! It auto focusses  silently when shooting video. Takes a little while to comprehend the multitude of camera settings, but it is quite an advanced bit of kit. All in all a very versatile package which saves carrying around a dedicated video camera as well.|#|I have owned the camera for about 1 month and haven't really found any. But thinking about it, the SD card door has a slightly flimsy feel to it, though in practice its probably just an illusion. The other point worth mentioning is the cost of genuine batteries - 50 GBP plus. There are aftermarket versions available that work fine for a fraction of the cost, I've got one, but be careful what you buy as GH1 firmware updates can render some inoperable - thanks a bunch Panasonic.
9.0|#|Full contol and handling like any other D-SLR but in a substantially more compact and light weight package. The included 14-140mm lens may be the only one you need to fit! The image quality is a definate step up from my previous Panasonic FZ28 bridge camera and the full HD movie mode is a great addition.|#|Higher ISO images (above 800) show more noise than a normal D-SLR (Nikon D90 or D3100) but generally is not a problem.
10.0|#|Great camera. I spent my life as a pro cameraman, and this little camera now gets used more than the other cameras and lenses that I own. Super results and ease of use. I'm grateful that these were not around when I started in the business some 50 years ago - makes it too easy!|#|None so far
10.0|#|Full of easy to use features, excellent image quality for the type of camera. Excellent results with intelligent Auto setting.|#|Intelligent Auto better than I am at setting camera !  Other than that for the money and type if camera it is, I am extremely impressed with it.
10.0|#|An excellent buy.   Smaller, lighter, more convenient and more versatile than the FZ30 and many a DSLR, the FZ38 is very easy to use and has hidden depths once you have mastered the (on CD only) handbook.   The LCD is surprisingly visible even in very bright sunlight.   Good value for money.|#|The handbook is the worst thing about the FZ38, being only on disc and there being no 'field guide' to go in the pocket or camera bag.   That is thoughtless when the camera has such an amazing range of excellent and often not imediately obvious features.
9.0|#|It allows you to be creative so a good camera to buy if your moving away from a point and shot camera and want to learn more about photography.|#|
10.0|#|Comfortable feel with ease of use.  Had a panasonic previously and this one is just as good with a few more added features.  I just really like the quality of this camera and would recommend this panasonic to anyone|#|None
9.0|#|Camera is easy to use and produces some really good results. So far I have been very impressed with the quality of the shots taken and when I line them up against my compact, there is a massive difference and improvement. It is very easy to use semi-manual modes as well as fully automatic modes.|#|The outer casing of the camera could be a little more robust or at least feel a little bit more robust. Night shots don't seem to turn out so great, but, that could be me that needs to learn a bit more about the camera's features.
9.0|#|A step up from the FZ28 that I had before - the 18 X Optical zoom is excellent. In my view everything you could wish for - I looked at lots of other makes and decided to stick to Panasonic - comparing to friends cameras I haven't found anything better for ease of use, image quality etc and certainly not at this price. It takes a 32MB SDHC card too so for videos and loads of 12mp photos it's great.|#|None that I've found so far.
10.0|#|I upgraded from an FZ-7 and so glad that I did as I enjoy taking pictures of birds and wildlife. I've just been on a recent trip to Sri Lanka which is why I wanted to upgrade and the photos I have taken this time with the X18 zoom are so superior to the others I can't believe it's me who has taken them! The new tracking is brilliant and the auto focus a gem for flying birds. I'm thrilled with this camera and have no regrets at all about upgrading apart from the fact I didn't do it earlier. It is light to carry, fits into my handbag for safe keeping and as far as I'm concerned has all the benefits of an SLR without the disadvantages. How many times did I hear the complaint go up that the right lens was never on the camera at the right time! I certainly NEVER had that problem|#|None, apart from the fact that the wide angle lens and the tele-photo lens that I had purchased for the FZ-7 of course don't fit this camera and they are quite expensive to buy
8.0|#|Light , easy to carry round, good compact for a professional used to DSLR. excellent image results Inc raw option.Macro is good. Easy to use, lots of manual functions too. Very pleased with it !|#|as with all compacts, the delay between pressing Shutter button and image being captured is frustrating to a DSLR user. There is a sports continuous shutter function but the megapixels are reduced.
10.0|#|Excellent camera for the price and the mini DSLR feel. Compared to the Nikon P60, this camera is miles ahead. Only comparison could have been a Canon, but the bulky AA(x4) batteries in it ruled it out for me. Panasonic's battery life is superb.300+ pics.|#|Could have had a more metal body than the plastic but after a few shots you might prefer it in plastic :)
10.0|#|When I recieved it and saw all the buttons and dials, I thought oh no!!!  But its so easy. Im one of these that likes to mess about with the camera and not read the instructions, and its that easy I worked it out within a short time. Well done Panasonic!!!!|#|None.
9.0|#|Excellent images and great value for money. This was the same price as the previous model.|#|
10.0|#|Some months ago I purchased the compact Panasonic TZ7. I was so impressed with the all round quality of this camera and wanting a replacement for my Fuji S9500, which I now find to be a bit on the heavy / bulky side, I decided to purchase the more compact Panasonic DMC-FZ38 which has proved to be an excellent buy.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this camera to any enthusiastic amateur photographer.|#|As yet have I not discovered any bad points.

9.0|#|An overall excellent camera that I have already used extensively.|#|
9.0|#|It gives such a wide range of flexibility and bridges the price gap brilliantly between a compact and a full SLR - the wide angle/telphoto range is excellent. And it can even take lens filters which many of these units can't - a 46mm one.|#|I haven't found any yet.
8.0|#|size closed to 'in pocket'|#|- Lens protection not 'included', has to be placed manually
10.0|#|Excellent camera. I bought this to replace my fz7, and it does the job immensely well. I couldn't believe just how much better it is. It takes brilliantly sharp images even in low light situations i.e taking photos in a dim lit indoor skate park. The video features are also  amazing it manages to stay in focus well and the quality is awesome, There are also many different formats to record in. Overall I think the camera is ace.|#|The only bad thing is that panasonic don't provide an avcHD lite  software editor.
9.0|#|I expect it to fulfill this purpose with ease.|#|Personally I would have preferred a printed instruction book rather than the CD format, but this is a common issue with many camera manufacturers.

9.0|#|It is light and has many easy to access features. I like the close up feature and the general sharpness.    I find it easier to carry around at all times than my SLR, and I don't have to change lenses when an unexpected subject emerges.  I was recommended to buy this model by two friends who take beautiful photos!  All the features seem easy to access.|#|Just occasionally, the auto focus feature fails to focus on the image for no apparent reason.
9.0|#|Great picture quality with the Leica lens  and easy to use. The zoom  is sharp and clear. The camera is really light. Battery life is long.|#|Video hasnt been totally straightforward although to be fair I havent been that interested in the feature. The only time I tried to use it I dont seem to have achieved a result!  I dont like having the major instruction manual on line. I like to be able to refer to finer points instantly whilst away from the computer and a compact manual would be useful.

9.0|#|The super zoom provides impressive results. Even hand-held at maximum zoom the anti-shake feature means pin sharp images. The movie mode works well and the one-button control makes it easy to switch from stills to movie mode. Pictures are bright and colourful. Light and responsive, this is an enjoyable camera to use.|#|The zoom control is not in the most convenient place and the zoom speed is quite slow, especially in movie mode, but this is really nit-picking. All in all a very good camera and definitely good value for money.

10.0|#||#|The quick fire or continuous shot function only offers 3 photos at full resolution, you have to go right down in quality to get full use, but I don't think many people will be using this at the end of a catwalk! (unlikely many will find this a problem, It has a fast pet function so I didn't need it for that)
10.0|#|This camera has delivered everything it promised and more. It has 13 different settings on the dial along with 14 different buttons, I was a bit daunted by this but soon got to grips with it. It is really easy to use in the IA and the P mode but as I am a point and shoot man I have had to get some books out of the library to help explain the finer points of photography to a camera simpleton. The photos I have taken are outstanding, and I have taken several photos with this and another camera with the same settings and the difference in quality speaks for itself. Overall an excellent purchase of a camera I would highly recommend to anybody from amatuer to budding professional.|#|The camera is so good I have had to read a few books on photography otherwise three quarters of this cameras capabilities would be wasted.

Very fast focus. Pinsharp lens with useful focal range that will cover virtually every photographic opportunity. Not pocketable but much smaller, portable and versatile than an SLR with a standard zoom.|#|In manual mode the camera should give an indication of the 'correct' exposure so that the user can more quickly assess how the chosen exposure will fair.

10.0|#|A good all round camera with excellent features. Image quality for stills and video for this type of camera is exceptional. I highly recommend this camera for the amateur photographer. Possibly one of the best cameras in its class.|#|The lens hood is a little cumbersome but not a major problem.
9.0|#|Portable, lightweight body which is smaller than an SLR but has almost all the capabilities. Phenomenal zoom which will do everything you need (27mm-486mm equivalent), cracking Leica lens produces crisp and clear photos. HD video is great with an instant access button on the camera so you miss nothing. Bundled software is good and the Panorama Maker in particular works really well.|#|I'm sure there are some and there are certainly better cameras out there, but they will cost a fortune and won't be as portable. This is an unbeatable value for money proposition.

9.0|#|Bought this older model in preference to later FZ45 or FZ100, despite their slightly longer zooms, because several other reviews rated its image quality higher. Used at ISO 80 we it is very acceptable for a long zoom camera, rendering fur or feathers far better than our previous FZ50. Much quicker writing RAW files to card, about 4sec compared to 20+. Autofocus and exposure seem very reliable, mostly set to P mode. Much lighter and smaller for carrying. Being rather traditional, have not tried the many scene modes, etc. yet. Overall, well pleased so far.|#|Motorised zooming harder to be precise than manual ring as on FZ50. Fixed LCD screen less versatile and more vulnerable (fit a screen protector!).

7.0|#|The strong point of this camera is its versatility. It offers a huge focal range in a compact, lightweight body; HD video; raw; custom menu settings; a fully auto setting, various scene modes, but also the options of varying degrees of manual control.|#|As with all these small-sensored superzoom cameras, the price to pay is in image quality. Keep it to low ISOs in good light and it performs well, but in less than ideal conditions it soon struggles. The dynamic range is also limited, with highlights easily blown. The write time when shooting raw is also rather slow, and the viewfinder is poor.

9.0|#|My first digital camera. very easy to use. very impressed withe quality of pictures. I bought this after reading reviews and they were confirmed. took pictures at night on fairground came out brilliant.|#|Nothing really so far apart from the instructions are includeed as a cd rather then in print which makes them not so accessible.
9.0|#|This camera is very easy to use in Intelligent Auto mode, has simple and clear displays, and good picture quality in photo and video modes. The zoom is very smooth, and there are oodles of pre-set function options for different conditions and occasions. However, to get the best out of it requires some understanding of its manual capabilities, as it offers considerable opportunity to be creative and experiment with shutters speeds, aperture, white balance etc. I would say it is a step up from a point and shoot camera, although it can do that very well. I am inexperienced in this more creative photography side, and purchased this camera to learn more and take better photos. The instruction manual on CD is very comprehensive yet clear, and although it takes some getting through if you are not already familiar with more advanced digital camera functions, I am confident that once I grasped these this will be a very capable, attractive, and well constructed camera, and is good value for money.|#|None so far, although you will soon need a good camera case to look after it in. There are newer, albeit more expensive, models and alternatives.
10.0|#|I'd recommend this camera to anyone wanting more than a compact without wanting the price tag of a DSLR, I'm no expert but I just can't fault the camera at all.  It's so easy to use, packed with features to allow you to take more control of your photos, small enought to carry around all the time and  it takes great photo's and video's.  The sound quality is brilliant, one button to switch from camera to video makes filming easy.  The lens range is more than enough for people getting into photography or without the budget to buy all the lenses to accomodate a DSLR.  Buy and enjoy.|#|None yet.

9.0|#|My dad has the FZ28 and it is fantastic, that is why I purchased the FZ38.  Having looked at the new F45 and F100 - the reviews were not good.  Stick to FZ38 I say|#|
10.0|#|Not got to grips with all the features as its got a fair few, but its made me want to get back out and take pics to find out what they all are, which is great|#|Only had a couple of weeks so not found any as of yet - will update if I do !
9.0|#|Good versatile camera for beginners and those wanting to explore the manual use of a digital camera with an excellent telephoto lense.|#|The lense cover removal before switching on though you do get a reminder if you forget.
9.0|#|Digital view finder an excellent alternative to LCD screen|#|
9.0|#|very good quality photos,excellent HD video and has virtually all the manual features i'm used to on my DSLR|#|only bad point i've found is that fitting a tripod mount prevents access to the battery compartment, but this is only a minor niggle
10.0|#|The fz38 has a great zoom can also be used when video recording and quiet in use ,excellent picture quality wheather using close up macro mode  or using full zoom video shooting is also excellent god colour very sharp footage and can be manualy set to your own taste ,its a great all in one and has won numerous awards and a great price!!!|#|none to mention it has set such a great bench mark for others to try and follow.

9.0|#|although at first glance looks like a complicated camera but take your time and go through the instructions slowly and you will discover a superb camera that you have purchased|#|
9.0|#|BTW, the battery life is awesome compared to my previous 2 Panasonics.|#|A little slower to auto focus and lacks a little in colour vibrancy compared to my TZ7/ZS3 but there is a manual setting to set your own colour preferrences on th FZ38 which I haven't tried yet.
9.0|#|I think it a very easy camera to use i like that it as  a veiw finder which is what i was looking|#|Not found any yet
10.0|#|I am very pleased with this camera.  Although I have only taken a few pictures so far, I have experimented with almost all of the different auto modes and the pictures have been excellent  - macro in particular is very good.  There seem to be plenty of different features and I think that there is likely to be something to suit most types of pictures.  I think it will probably take me a little while to become familiar with the location of all the facilities, but most things seem easy to find.  I haven't yet experimented with the manual mode.|#|None so far!

The panasonic fz-38 also has alot of features internally eg different scene modes alot of picture modes and the movie (recording) side is superb.|#|The only bad point is the picture can be slightly blurry if taken in motion but I'm sure I'll find a setting for it!
9.0|#|Easy to use for the not so experienced photographer especially the intelligent auto mode which did a great job of assessing the scene and picking the appropriate settings for you. Plenty of manual settings also if you fancy playing about.|#|Sometimes the autofocus took a bit longer the sharpen up but that was few and far between. Excellent camera otherwise.
9.0|#|Lightweight and comfortable to use. well constructed and most frequently used controls are easy to access. battery life exceptionally good. nice clear pictures under all conditions. easy connection to computer for downloading and editing pictures.

9.0|#|This camera is very easy to use in its automatic mode and gives superb quality results. The zoom range is excellent and I certainly don't need separate supplementary lenses. There are lots of additional features which you don't need straight away, but they are there to take up.|#|The paper instruction manual is rather brief and whilst the cd-rom is comprehensive you don't usually have it with you on holidays etc.

10.0|#|It's so easy to use.  I've only had pocket compacts before so I'm a proper novtice re cameras.  The Intellegent Auto mode is good for 90% of situations (great for me).  Read the manual for the other 10% of times when you'll need to set stuff yourself and trust me you'll impress yourself with the results.  For the price it's a steal, it really is.|#|There aren't any bad points.  The body isn't metal but for the money I wouldn't really expect it to be.
9.0|#|Great zoom range and very good for night shots|#|Video limited to 30 mins while US version is dependent on the memory card size
9.0|#|excellent features for the money, better then average picture quality, excellent HD video,|#|My opinion very poor body build quality, cheap plastic, easy to scratch/damage..  Not excellent grip for large palm and  far too light camera (extra few grams would make it more steady) Menu can be complicated for some users...
10.0|#|Very nice to handle, not to heavy, and very good quality pics and vids, great telephoto for the close ups, even after you have taken the photos you can zoom in on the picture for some great quality close ups. Will give the top end of the digital cameras a run for its money|#|None at moment

9.0|#|Both Image Quality and Video Quality are excellent. Very easy to Use but I am yet to do complete hands-on on the Camera so it will be little early to say anything... Overall, I have already done good research on this Camera so I think this is one of the best in Digital Camera with 18x Super Zoom (really v good). I can suggest someone to buy this blindly :)|#|Yes to discover :)

9.0|#|Light weight and compact.  Very good image stabilisation makes hand holding maximum zoom easy.  Excellent image quality at all focal lengths.  Surprisingly nice viewfinder.  Very good battery life.  Handles nicely. Intelligent auto is a very powerful point and shoot mode. This camera exceeded my expectations based on the reviews and sample pictures, and I took to it immediately.|#|Would have preferred an additional point and shoot option with no sticky settings after switch off.
9.0|#|Great 18x zoom lens and the ability to capture video in HD mode|#|None that I know of so far.
8.0|#|very well made, lightweight considering the size. Faantastic Intelligent auto button to help the likes of me get started??|#|Lots of buttons that do all sorts, but not sure what they are all for yet, so the bad point is really ME the technophobe!!
9.0|#|Excellent all round camera for those wanting to have the option of experimenting a little further from fully automated point and shoot  compact cameras.|#|Haven't yet come across any significant bad points.
10.0|#|I am not technical, so probably dont make the most of my panasonic DMC-FZ38, but I find it a joy to use. Lovely clear pictures, everything I want from it. You will not be disappointed if you buy one.|#|No bad points that I am aware of yet!
10.0|#|Superb! Having already experienced  the Panasonic LS80 8 megapixel we thought that we'd take a step up the ladder for our trip to Kenya on safari.  David Attenborough eat your heart out!|#|
9.0|#|The pictures are high quality, with different options for the discerning photographer. The ability to record HD (720p) video from a one touch button is good, although it does take a couple of seconds to start recording, and you can only record 29m59s of video in one go, otherwise it would be classed as a camcorder and would cost more.|#|Feels a bit plasticy for the money, sturdy though. The screen can be difficult to see in sunny conditions and the button to switch to the Electronic View Finder, although pleasing to use at times, does feel more gimmicky than anything else

10.0|#|small, lightweight camera but with an 18x zoom and best of all great image stabilisation allowing you to take great hand held shots at the equivalent of over 400mm. This camera has a multitude of options and settings for the more experienced photographer, but also has an automatic mode making it a great point and shoot for the beginer. Also can shoot HD movies and you can zoom whilst taking movies. Even has very clever tricks like face recognition.|#|not found any so far!
10.0|#|great camera overall ... iam really happy with it.|#|nothing as of yet ...
8.0|#|Excellent automatic use - just point and shoot - excellent for choosing focus|#|Short battery life
9.0|#|The camera is light which is great for traveling. I'm pleased with the lens which is giving me good quality photos and not too obtrusive when trying to get sneaky shots of people! It is very simple to use in comparison to my last camera and does not have a huge number of buttons and dials! I like that there is a button to review the photos that you.ve taken rather than the same button that you take the photo with, sounds trivial but it's handy! The screen is fine and there is a nice creative setting on the camera which gives nice results. It's also a sturdy camera having survived a couple of drops unscathed! all in all good value for what you pay.|#|The fact that it's light can also be a negative as you can get camera shake. however if it's a camera for traveling with then lightness is a bonus! You decide.
10.0|#|Good start-up, features, comprehensive manual.|#|None really
9.0|#|Very easy ti use, wonderful photo quality|#|Lot of noise when taking photo inside the night without flash... but eh no camera is perfect :)
8.0|#|Logical Menus, Good Zoom Range. Light weight|#|Slow  to zoom and focus.
9.0|#|Very good product. Easy to use. Numerous possibilities. Light device. Intuitive and clear menus. Almost completed device!|#|It should be situated in the center or to the right of the device. Indeed, by maintaining the device with the left hand, as recommended for any reflex camera (and Bridge), the left thumb can take place easily in front of the assistance's light of focussing and so falsify the sharpness of the image.
10.0|#|Close up macro captures amazing images.|#|It takes too many steps to get to manual focus although it does work well once in manual focus mode.
9.0|#|Well designed and ease of use. With the amount of features on the camera, you can spend fiddling and trying different things. I would definitely recommend the camera. Love it!|#|None...Yet :)
8.0|#|Good product at a very good price.|#|
8.0|#|Feels like a proper camera. Image quality good. Long focal length lens. You can put plenty of manual input into your pictures.|#|As usual with digital cameras there are far to many features that you will not use and remembering how to use them nearly impossible. Screen easily washed out by sun. Software that came with camera would not load onto computer.
7.0|#|Quality of pictures taken so far very good but as yet still to use some of the modes where little information given in the manual.|#|My previous camera was a Panasonic DMC TZ7 where the instruction manual was excellent, had I been aware that the instruction manual on the DMC FZ38 then I doubt if I would have purchased this camera..

9.0|#|Bought this for a tad under £180. Had it a month and really pleased with the camera. It is quite complicated to set the type of photo, but after a couple of hours of use it is very easy to use. As with most things, leave it with one of the kids and they tell you how to use it.....looking forward to trying it out for real in the Big Apple next week....|#|None at present, a little uncomfortable to hold but that is being picky.
9.0|#|Good Quality. Results so far have been very good.|#|No proper Instruction Manual, only for initial set-up. The rest is on Cd to load on computer but that is difficult to read as there are so many pages and it is awkward to get from one page to another. Too many pages to print out!
8.0|#|Versatile. Lightweight. Quickstart. Excellent zoom range. Electronic View Finder useful in bright light surroundings.|#|Full operating manual only in digital format.

10.0|#|Exactly what you would expect from a Panasonic product. Very impressed with the optical image stabilizer and also the many options on the camera usage ie. shutter priority, aperture priority, and manual setting all which allow for creativity if you want it. A real quality camera all round.|#|
10.0|#|Light weight. Superb image quality and colour. Packed with features including high quality HD video. Taking a picture can be as simple (with intelligent auto) or as complicated (with manual setup) as you like. Good value for money and from a manufacturer you can trust. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for the improved quality and control offered by a bridge camera.|#|I haven't found any bad points as yet but if I were more serious about photography I'd probably invest in a second battery pack so I didn't get caught out.
10.0|#|Amazing quality and zoom facility and I'm sure there is much more to this camera than I have already found but it is so clever in auto mode (idiot proof) that I am becoming a very lazy excellent photographer. Colours are very true and the video facility is also very simple. My last camera didn't allow me to zoom during filming , this on does. Very Happy.|#|Not fould any yet.

10.0|#|i think is one of best camera in market and best picture quality|#|
9.0|#|Lightweight and very quick start up|#|Working through the menus and remembering which options are allowed.
7.0|#|nice looking camera, takes pictures quicklu no need to wait for it to load.|#|Imae quality is poor, hard to focus colours corecctly as currently blonde people come out in pictures as strawberry blonde.
9.0|#|Compact. easy to handle|#|view finder LCD monitor  not flrexible being fixed
8.0|#|Really good - natural colours in terms of picture quality. Video good and sound loud enough. Excellent battery life.|#|None major bad points so far...
9.0|#|it certainly does what it says on the box but...|#|setups. Also, it has a habit of ignoring some of your settings and introduces some of its own defaults, which sometimes affect the result you were after or else are just an annoying intrusion. A regular user would eventually get accustomed to its idiosynchratic nature, but a less regular user would have difficulty in remembering what's what.
9.0|#|GReat Camera. Takes lovely pictures. Loads of settings which I havent worked out how to use yet. Great High Def video with HDMI socket. Better than normal digital cameras.|#|Only small gripe but its onlty a small one. No proper camera case so you just have to find one thats fits
9.0|#||#|It has little internal memory. It has been discontinued
10.0|#|Picture quality is very good, backed up by a very long zoom. Did not think I would notice such a big improvement over my, Lumix 10x zoom TZ 2.|#|Somewhat bigger than my TZ 2, wont fit in my pocket.
10.0|#|everything is adjustable its amazingly complicated but quite rewarding. A perfect starter digital SLR|#|not for the faint hearted
7.0|#|I cannot much about the machine, because I am very inexperiente and feel that I need some courses/book.|#|Cannot see any.
10.0|#|Generally enjoying my Lumix very much.|#|Would have appreciated a printed instruction manual to have with the camera at all times.
9.0|#|Still getting my head round the manual part but my images are improving every time! Great image quality.|#|some of the modes e.g. night mode automatically compensate image quality.
9.0|#|Quite easy to use but needed to refer to the manual which is only on CD. Considering I took it out of the box and played with it before reading anything, the pictures were much better than my one year old compact. Fantastic size, not to big or bulky. Can do so much with it and looking forward to taking it to Egypt later in the year.|#|Manual only comes with on CD so have to boot up laptop each time to read up on it, minor niggle.
10.0|#|Quality of still shots|#|Nothing yet
10.0|#|Its a great camera to handle. Focusing is excellant|#|Have not found one yet
10.0|#|Very easy to use and understand.  Perfect bridge camera.|#|I guess the only thing might be the little joystick to change apeture and shutter speed.  A little bit fiddly.
1.0|#||#|Just found out after buying it that this model is discontinued. I would have been far happier to buy the latest model even if the cost was higher! (Within reason.)
9.0|#|Good pictures, and great HD video|#|
9.0|#|At first if you do not understand all the functions which can take time to get used too just use the auto-focus which takes great photos.You can then start using the manual features at your leisure..The camera looks like a top of the range expensive one because of all its features but for someone to move up from a pocket digital and do not want to spend hundreds on a SLR and end up confused this camera for me ticks all the boxes.|#|the intelligent auto focus produces great shots.
9.0|#|Photographs so far appear to be crisp and clear.|#|Would have been nice to have a manual incuded.
10.0|#|I upgraded to this camera from a Fuji finepix but didn't want to send a lot.  I have read lots of excellent reviews and I've not been dissapointed.  Its easy to use and can be used as a point and shoot if thats what you want.  I wanted to start learning a little more about the techincal side of photography and have found it easy to apply to this camera, on the semi-auto settings and on the fully manual settings. Overall I'm really pleased with this camera and would recommend it to anyone wanting to get into more creative photography without spending a fortune.|#|

10.0|#|Excellent point and shoot camera with fantastic results, pictures are sharp and bursting with colour, loads of easily selected modes for outdoor / indoor, portraits sport etc. Intelegent auto takes brilliant photos effortlessly. Powerfull flash with red eye reduction and excellent HD Video thrown in too. Using this as a stepping stone to the bigger digital SLR cameras but to be honest this has it all..... fantastic value.. highly recommeded, this camera will not disappoint!|#|Cant think of any!

9.0|#|I'm just a novice but, this camera is so good even I can take brilliant pictures.|#|
9.0|#|Good picture quality. Easy and quick to use. Few hours play without reading manual and you are an expert. Battery and charger is a great idea.|#|Menu is not best quality and sometimes confusing. Could have spare battery that could help in long trips.
10.0|#|Although it has a very efficient automatic program, you can also progressively use it more personnaly. A good transition to the reflex camera.|#|
10.0|#||#|THE FACT THAT THE NIGHT VISION IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH I.E. I AM NOT ABLE TO USE THE FLASH AS WELL AS THE NIGHT VISON AT HE SAME TIME... COULD I GET HELP WITH THAT??
10.0|#|Very easy to use, great image quality, considering all features really good value for money.|#|In manual mode you do seem a little limited as to aperture settings etc at slow shutter speed couldn't set aperture of say f16 or higher. But need to have a better play as may be able to get round this.
10.0|#|So far, the quality of the photos are super fantastic, the battery seems to last for ages before needing charging. There are so many features I keep coming across which is fun to use.|#|

9.0|#|Excellent lens, easy controls, clear rear screen and a viewfinder (so, so useful in really bright circumstances.|#|Far too clever for me --- too many options so most of the time I let the camera do its own thing (Intelligent auto -- unlike the owner)

8.0|#|High quality video and good image definition|#|Solwly shutter speed, so you can't take pictures to medium-high speed.
9.0|#|My first experiences using the camera have been positive.  I haven't used it enough to award a 10 in each category however I found the menu system very easy once I had taken a few minutes to study it.  The picture quality is extremely good and the camera is small and compact.  Opening and closing the lens cover is a novel way of turning the camera on and off whilst protecting the lens and I like it.|#|Not really a bad point just different from what I have been used to. Haviing to remember to press the iA button on top of the camera before pressing the shutter button to take an automatic picture.  I'm sure in time I will get used to it.
9.0|#|I already owned a Lumix and so did my husband. He had his stolen and so I replaced it with the FP3 for Xmas. He used to be a professional photographer and is quite particular about what he uses. The Lumix has a Leica lens. The FP3 is ultra slim and can fit in a top pocket - which is why I chose it. Means he can have a decent camera with him wherever he goes. It has a large display screen and intuitive menu.|#|The touch screen is very appealing but can be slow to work and sometimes needs repeated tries.
9.0|#|Easy to use point and shoot camera with good quality pictures and build quality, even the most techno feared person can use this camera.|#|Because of its size and style the zoom capacity slightly lacks clowt

Compact and user friendly you really don't need to look at the instructions to know how to do most of the things you need|#|None what so ever. the touch screen wouldn't work with my fingers at Christmas taking photos outside, however I think this was because it was about minus 10 degrees not the cameras fault.

10.0|#|Bought this camera for my grand-daughters 21st and she is delighted with it. she wanted a camera for essential use relating to her university. This is the camera I would buy for myself!  I was talking to her last night and she has already posted some of her pictures on a social networking site having used the camera for both work and pleasure. She said that it's brilliant for taking a 'quick opportunity' snap as it does all the work for you with the auto setting. I have recommended this camera to a friend for both excellent features and excellent value for money.|#|None as  yet.
9.0|#|It is an amazing little camera - great battery life - easy to use menu - very quick response - short shutter lag|#|no in-car charger
8.0|#|The fold out touch screen viewfinder is more than just a gimmick, it really does give you more control. The camera is surprisingly light in weight and controls are positioned perfectly (as long as you're right-handed!). The flexibility of shooting stills or HD video with the same unit is valuable when touring. It comes with a proper printed manual, you don't have to download and print a pdf at your own expense as so often nowadays.|#|The zoom action of the standard 14-42 lens is not as smooth as I would like and I'm not sure how durable the plastic mount is going to be. The built in flash is little better than useless, but there is a hot shoe for an accessory flash. There is no accommodation for a cable release which I would have found useful.
9.0|#|The twin lens kit comes with lens hoods which can be reversed and securely stowed on the lens and also individual lens bags which I thought was a nice touch|#|Spare batteries have to be Panasonic batteries as they are 'chipped' and thus they are three times more expensive than alternative makes.
9.0|#|Very light to handle, with either lens. This is particularly useful to me as I find the heavier cameras create more camera shake, especially when using a telephoto lens. I like the size also.  Probably men with larger hands might find it too small to negotiate the controls, but being a woman with smaller hands, I found it to be the perfect size for me.  The menu is very user friendly and simple to negotiate. Very good for the amature who likes preset menus, but also very good for the enthusiast who like to do the manual thing.  I particularly love the swivel back screen as safety for the actual screen as well as for those awkward shots.  I'm not too tall so I can hold the camera higher and still what I'm taking.  The same applies to low to the ground shots.  Especially if kneeling or lying down is not an option!  The controls are placed really well and easy to locate.  I like the material the camera body is made of.  It helps with grip.  Overall, I'm really happy with it.|#|There's a bit of a lag in shutter time between shots.  But, given the overall good points, I'm prepared to put up with this.
10.0|#|videos even in low light conditions.|#|button to release in small gap, makes release tricky if you have large fingers.
9.0|#|High quality images lots of good features on stills and video, light weight|#|Can be a bit complicated for a beginner
10.0|#|Size reduction, much lighter in weight - comprehensive addition of 'extras' with many other cameras. Performance is something yet to determine, but the Panasonic name must infer excellence.|#|Too early to make much comment, but the camera book is not very well laid out as some other (Canon) makes are, and it is rather more of a battle to understand the basic layout and operations - but perhaps time will pay-off on   the study part - especially for those moving up from the more simple point-and-shoot cameras.
9.0|#|takes high quality video and the flip out screen is useful.|#|menu navigation in a bit cumbersome.
9.0|#|For the beginner, this is a very good starting camera and the Manual is very simple to use.|#|The only bad point of the design is the position of the lens release button.  When holding the camera ready to take a picture, the button can be accidently pressed.
8.0|#|The rubber feel to the body makes it secure to hold. The features are good although i havnt tried most of them yet. Really like the touch screan. I feel that the camera has alot more to offer than i have experience so far. Will just take me a little time to get to grips with what it can do and im justing starting out in photography.|#|None so far
10.0|#|Has the right feel when shooting photos, not too heavy or too light. Image stabaliser works really well.  The large moveable screen helps when taking awkward shots, tough screen is very helpful as well.|#|A lot to learn, but then I am fairly new to this type of camera.  Takes a bit of getting used to the manual.
9.0|#|shooter to the keen amateur.  Touchscreen is useful if required or you can use the buttons instead.   Too expensive when first released but a bargain at current prices.|#|Limited to 720p video
9.0|#|Very well built and high quality|#|bit fiddly to get used too, while bought for its compact size, buttons are very cramped.
10.0|#|Fantastic compact camera with every feature you could require, we especially liked the video capability and quality of recording.|#|The instruction manual.   Not easy to follow and does not have  quick reference section,

6.0|#|lightweight, strong|#|does comes with a t.v. cable, but my only gripe was, perhaps this wouldn't be a problem with others, that whilst I was moving the camera, I needed to see the movemnts live on the t.v. screen as I did so. with another camera that I had, this wasn't a problem
8.0|#|Compact, good screen size, comprehensive instructions.|#|short battery life, battery has to be removed to charge.

9.0|#|well made. Fully manual setting is also achievable which is great for when I am more experienced. Small size makes for a truly pocketable, high quality camera.|#|that is not ideal. No flip-out/movable screen. These 2 omissions are all that separate this camera from perfection, in my opinion.
9.0|#|When used with the 14mm lens, this camera is very compact and produces superb images, the menus are logical and makes setting and using the camera very easy. The touchscreen is very responsive and practical.|#|None to-date
8.0|#|Lightness and compactness combined with good quality images: near-SLR quality images at a near-compact camera size.|#|This is more a lacking of suitable cases to go with this camera, rather than a problem with the camera itself: I wanted a camera case that would not be too bulky. However, most small camera cases do not cater for the lens sticking-out at the front.
8.0|#|Compact, light, with inbuilt flash, and with the interchangeable lenses it is really portable as well as taking great quality pictures.|#|some of the modes are fairly complicated but overall is a great product!
9.0|#|Amazing value for money|#|Menu a little complex - although got used to them fairly quickly
9.0|#|The image quality is excellent, the features are all very useful( when you can find some of them), the feel and size of the camera, build quality, lenses.|#|Very very fiddly and awkward menu's, they are a real pain to get your head around and a real pain to adjust things that are simple. Sometimes the quick menu is actually slower!

9.0|#|The colours are so vibrant and the pictures are crysal clear. It will take a while to figure out how to use it properly as it has more options than I can figure out. The flash works instantly so when my kids are zooming around it actually captures them in shot.|#|You can change settings without realising what the hell is going on and the leans cap likes jumping off on the big lens as there is no string to secure it to the camera.
8.0|#|easy to use. good functios|#|none so far.
4.0|#|Plenty of features|#|May as well buy a quality Nikon SLR such as D90 will be cheaper in the long run as you still need to buy extra lens's for the Panasonic which are priced at a premium. The camera is not that good to justify the cost of add on's. This purchase was a mistake.

10.0|#|Very easy to get started - (once the battery is charged) - just turn it on and start taking pictures!  The auto function pretty much takes care of the vast majority of photos/conditions. It feels more substantial than a lot of other cameras I looked at and the touch screen is very easy to use and understand (if you already use a smartphone, it'll seem like second nature). I've only had it for a couple of weeks so I'm still getting to know it, but I'm glad I went for this.|#|A very minor point, which does not affect the camera in any way but, I always find it a bit annoying when you have to download the operating instructions via a computer. It's a very easy camera to use but if you want to learn a little more or use some of the other functions you have to go online as the camera only comes with a very basic start up guide.  Sometimes it is nice to have a booklet to refer to!

8.0|#|Easy to use. Didn't even have to look at the instructions however it does help if you already have a lumix as they are pretty much all the same. Superb compact for the pocket. Didn't want the TZ versions with extra zoom as this makes them bulkier. Have had Lumix cameras in the past and find them really easy. The touch screen is easy to use once you are used to it. The touch screen is great for getting focus. You just touch the screen on what you want the camera to focus on and it does it, rather than the object behind or next to etc.|#|Struggles a little with fast moving shots. My 8 weeks old moves so quick with her arms and legs its usually blurry. The only down side to the touch screen is when you want to turn the flash off it is a little slow to get through the menu...by which time the shot has gone. On my normal lumix you quickly press a button.

After using it for a couple of weeks half the screen went black, although it still took the whole picture.  I contacted Panasonic, got the address of the repair shop and it was all done on the guarantee and back to me within 10 days.  So I was very happy with the fix.

8.0|#|Very simple to use. I find the menus quite intuitive.|#|None that are immediately apparent. It does feel a bit plasticy, but that of course help it to be lightweight. A worthwhile compromise for me.

10.0|#|A bridge camera with manual focus and automatic features, it also includes interesting creative styles. It records HD video with stereo sound, which is something unusual on a camera this prize. The picture quality is great too. The thing I like the most is the ability of taking night shots without a tripod! They look so sharp everytime, the same for super zoom photographs, the stabilizer is superb!|#|Haven't found any yet

8.0|#|Chose the FZ48 for the higher zoom and for the good reviews including excellent macro results. Agree that both zoom and macro are superior in the 48.|#|I miss the movable screen - used it a lot on the FZ30 for getting a good shot from above people/barriers in front of the subject.  Not sure the FZ48 shoots in RAW, though I didn't use that feature anyway in the FZ30. The zoom bracket is not as smooth as the zoom ring on the 30. Not had chance to experiment much more yet!

10.0|#|Great lens and picture quality. This model lacks the GPS of the TZ30 which means longer battery life and cheaper price, and I usually know where I am when I take a shot!|#|Not as yet.
8.0|#|Very clear photos, and easy to use. I particularly use the Macro a lot, which is perfect|#|USB cable is too short, and the camera isn't able to charge via USB cable connected to PC, so it means you have to lay the camera on the floor to charge

8.0|#|It is however a superb camera.|#|The feature that allows the camera to upload pictures to your PC via WiFi automatically whilst being charged can be difficult to set-up if your network is slightly non-standard or you not tech savvy and the manual is poor in the area.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality and impressive telephoto lens. Useful ability to control camera from an ipad. As usual with the Panasonic Lumix range the Intelligent automation setting produces stunning pictures by just pointing and shooting. For the more experienced photographer there are more than enough advanced features to keep one  enjoying the camera for many years ahead.|#|Not exactly a bad point but considerable time is needed to study and effectively use all the interesting features. The plastic body rather than the metal body is less pleasurable but equally functional.
9.0|#|Does everything.|#|Remembering what it can do. Wont make cappuccino.
8.0|#||#|Can't see the point of having to charge the battery in the camera ; effectively the camera is out of action whilst the battery is charging. A separate mains charge would be much more sensible

8.0|#|Takes good photo's and 20 zoom is good.|#|Cannot get wifi to work. Spent money to get instruction booklet printed but this is vague and is really not that much help.

9.0|#|Excellent light compact camera, fab photo quality and so easy to use, this is a must for anyone who likes to take photos, wants great picture quaility without taking the kitchen sink!|#|Hard to see screen in bright sunlight, but that goes for all camera and phone screens, maybe a small pull out shade for around the screen on the next model :-)
9.0|#|Supper zoom with image stabilizer makes it total usable in low light at full telephoto. Intelligent program mode detects common modes such as close-up, portrait, landscape, night sky and more automatically. Oodles of creative controls and scene modes to choose from for that professional touch. Touch screen focus, shoot and zoom control is a bonus over the nearest competition. Small enough for your pocket but not too small that is difficult to hold with two hands. With GPS and the best Wi-Fi implementation in the peer group makes this the best all round compact for your pocket.|#|Not much, I would prefer an external battery charger and exposure assistance in A and S mode like in the M mode would help. Not the best resolution of the bunch in very low light conditions but this is being a little picky.

10.0|#|Haven't fully explored all the functions but the video quality and sound seems superb, the start up to photo capture speed is the fastest I've come across, photos seem brilliant quality, am used to panasonics so all the rest is up to the usual standard.|#|Not found anything I didn't like yet. Just once the shutter didn't fully open but was on a beach so probably down to sand getting involved as it was quite windy.
9.0|#|simple to use just point and press. can also record 10min videos|#|none
10.0|#|got it on sal can't complain, it is certainly good enough, had Lumix in the past and they are really good|#|too early to say
9.0|#|Very lightweight, not too many buttons but plenty of features including different shooting modes, filters and photo editing capability. Any easy 'point and click' camera|#|
8.0|#|Great optical zoom.  Compact.and light.  Very high quality pictures for such a small unit.  Some fun creative effects that kids will love.  A perfect first proper.camera for an older child.|#|Controls could be a bit fiddly if you have big hands but then it's a small camera.

9.0|#|ease of use ,size,quality.|#|very few..:-)
7.0|#|Settings on the camera are quite easy to work out, and are fairly intuitive.|#|Doesn't seem all that robust. If you just put the SD card into your laptop it doesn't seem to find the photos - you have to use the Panasonic software to view and copy them across, and I haven't really figured out how to use that properly yet. Seems to take quite a long time to get ready for the next shot, but maybe that is due to the speed of the SD card.
7.0|#|Good while it worked!|#|It broke within 18 months :-(
10.0|#|Easy to use|#|Not found any yet
7.0|#|Good picture quality. Quite easy to use if you've had a similar model. Plenty of features to play with.|#|Feels cheap - this could be to do with making it lightweight rather than scrimping on quality parts but for me it doesn't feel like the money I spent on it.
9.0|#|easy to use|#|
9.0|#|Size, very compact.|#|No case, no macro
9.0|#|Definitely a perfect choice for anyone who wants a compact camera which packs many features seen in SLRs but at a much lower price. I'd suggest that anyone buying this camera get a 16GB SDHC memory card at least as this will give you about 2 hours of HD video at highest quality. I highly recommend this camera.|#|They could have packed in a case and HDMI cable, but there camera is great value as it is, so these would only up the price.
10.0|#|It also compensated very well for shaking hands, the pictures were crystal clear.|#|Secondly, just watch out for the video mode.  I don't think it was automatically in HD mode, but rather a lower spec, and we didn't find out until after we had taken them, which was a disappointment.  I guess if we had read the instructions - that wouldn't have been a problem!
10.0|#|feature is generally very intelligent.|#|The zoom and mode switches are a bit flimsy, but not too bad. Whilst the HD video is excellent, the accompanying software is, quite frankly, a dog.
10.0|#|Great range of functions, all of which it performs well. 12x optical zoom is quite quick and useful. AVCHD lite movies are excellent quality for a still camera, not high def in quality but easily standard def on a HDTV. Takes good macro photo's and IA works well in most situations. Writes to SDHC very quickly. Stereo microphone works well.|#|The mode dial moves easily and the camera won't do anything until it's in place. Zoom is slow in movie mode. Battery life is not great, probably only takes about 80-100 photo's but the battery charges quickly.
8.0|#|Easy to use, great zoom range and wide angle, and  good quality outputs.|#|Battery life limited, motor of movie quite noisy, format of  ACHDlite not recognised by Google Photos or Mediaplayer
10.0|#|Great build quality- metal body with good grip.  Fab as a point and shoot as it has auto intelligence features so it will do everything for you at the push of a button (even your nan could use it!!) or it has other advanced features for more experienced photographers. will zoom in and out in video mode. Great battery life - when you just want to view your pictures the lens does not come out - saving your battery. I did a lot of research before i bought this camera and it has definitely lived up to its reviews - would recommend this camera to anyone as it suits all types of photographers and produces good quality images.  Bit more expensive than the average compact camera but definitely worth that bit extra if you can afford it as you wont be wanting another camera for years.|#|the control dial can easily get knocked out of place when getting your camera in and out of your bag - not a big deal but just make sure you check this before taking your photos.
9.0|#|hd video great for such a compact camera, image quility very good, 12x optical zoom is impressive, large screen is a plus, very easy to use, point and shoot|#|battery life, would suggest buying additional battery, operations can be a little slow at times, you will need a class 6 sdhc card for hd video, all in all i have not any major complaints.
10.0|#|Love the wide angle and huge zoom on such a compact camera. Screen is fantastic and picture quality brilliant. Lots of great features, and the video button on the rear panel makes switching from still to video so easy. Great HD videos too! Sounds like you're actually there!|#|Have to remember to take video in HD jpg format as opposed to AVHDC if you want to be able to use footage easily.
9.0|#|The TZ7 is slightly smaller in size than earlier TZ models and doesn't bulge a jacket pocket, therefore more likely to be taken out and about and capture those fleeting special moments.|#|
9.0|#|Great zoom lens (12x). High def movie capability. Great quality.|#|Would like more manual controls. Shutter / aperature priority. Included PC software clunky (best find alternatives)
9.0|#|My husband is a keen photographer but wanted a second camera that is light and small but still excellent quality, this camera certainly fits the bill!|#|
10.0|#|Sturdy design and construction of camera. Excellent features on the camera when using manual intelligent mode. Excellent software provided by Panasonic, especially the panoramic picture creator.|#|Wish I had bought it sooner.
10.0|#|great picture quality, excellent zoom, good size display screen, compact, good features, easy to use.|#|would prefer a view finder along with the display screen, for the days when it is sunny as the sun can block the view through the display screen. Remember to buy a memory card, as the camera memory isn't great.
9.0|#|There's just so many to list... went out on a day trip to Go Ape and took this camera round with me. and filmed people and myself jumping off things and going down zip wires, All i can say for such a easy camera to use its photos and videos are out of this world.. if your looking for one at this price and size then this is the one for you.. Hope it helps|#|i would say to get a memory card made by PANASONIC as i went on holiday with a diffrent make of memory card and after a few days of taking photos it stopped working, this is nothing to do with the TZ7... I'm just saying don't go cheap on HDSC....!!!!
9.0|#|Picture Quality, versatility and ease of use|#|Short battery life from charge
9.0|#|handy having a camera and camcorder together|#|dial on top of camara does tend to get knocked and turn
10.0|#|Really easy to use|#|The camera does not come with a case, screen protector or a very large memory card and these can all add considerably to the price.
8.0|#|Very fast at previewing photos.|#|No viewfinder, can be difficult to use LCD in bright light.
9.0|#|superb photos - movie quality excellent- sound on video better than previous model|#|when using video - diificult to initially focus - due to no picture on screen at start
9.0|#|Ergonomics good, no Buttons to press accidentally.|#|No camera Case Included. Owners Manual not easy to assimilate.
9.0|#|Auto-intelligence modes enables great quality, easy point and shoot photography. Excellent quality with 10M effective pixels and 12 times optical zoom magnification. High resolution video is a good as a decent HD camcorder. An excellent high resolution rear display. Quick and accurate face detection.|#|Being picky, the Auto-focus in video recording mode can be a little slow and it would be nice if it was a little less bulky (but I don't know of a smaller camera with all these features!).
9.0|#|Excellent camera with tremendous functionality. Superb quality pictures.|#|Mode dial relatively easily disturbed. Screen difficult to see in very bright conditions.
9.0|#|Light weight, good to have 12x optical zoom in such a compact camera. easy to change to different settings.|#|Can't see the screen in bright sunlight. Sometimes have to take photo blind then look at result. Delay between pressing to take the photo and the time the photo is taken.
9.0|#|Very simple to use, small enough to fit in a pocket if necessary.|#|A bit slow when there is a need to take several pictures rapidly.
10.0|#||#|Not quite worked out the MS1 and MS2 option but I will investigate when I have more time.
9.0|#|Great camera for the money. Some features which make this camera stand out above the rest.  The picture quality is excellent. The HD video is second to none.|#|There are some small niggles in the design which might annoy some; function select knob is vulnerable to being knocked; zoom is very slow.
9.0|#|Intelligent Auto system works very well!|#|A little more control over individual settings like exposure time would be nice!
9.0|#|The video is again very good for a camera this size, Great for casual videos without the need for a video camera as well this will do the job!.|#|Cost of spare battery. No view finder, in bright sunlight the sceen is hard to read.
9.0|#|HD movie function is excellent, having the zoom capability is very good. Image quality is also very good and very simple to operate. As the TZ7 is now end of life I would strongly recommend the TZ8 ... worth the money. Great camera.|#|None spring to mind as of yet but have not used it in all light conditions yet.
10.0|#|Awesome quality movie footage and excellent still camera too. Usually you have to sacrifice 1 for the other, eg. a good quality still camera usually has a standard definition movie camera and thus a HD definition camera usually has a poor quality stills camera. Also it has stereo sound recording whereas most around this price range only have mono sound recording capability. Best around for the price if you ask me.|#|None to think of. Very pleased.
10.0|#|Easy to use and great to have the HD option for videos.|#|Doesn't come with any software to play any HD videos - had to download from the internet a compatible codec to play HD.
9.0|#|Everything else, especially wide angle lens and ease to switch to video mode.|#|Would prefer snapshot button on far right of camera and option wheel (which moves a bit too easily) to the left of it.
9.0|#|Simply stunning camera. HD video, beautiful photos, looks fantastic and very easy to use due to a FULL auto setting (selects picture type, white balance, flash, just about everything automatically). The LCD display is high res so pin sharp. I upgraded from the TZ3 and it is worth every penny over an already excellent camera.|#|HD video is glorious - but - the auto focus gets confused easily and is slow to respond. It failed to capture some scenes but overall due to it being a compact digital this is a small, if slightly annoying issue.
10.0|#|big screen fantastic lens producing great photo's superb colours|#|a little bit dificult to hold without putting fingers on screen
9.0|#|EASE OF USE,|#|NO VEIWFINDER
10.0|#|Very good quality images. The camera is extremely smart - makes adjustments automatically to ensure you get the best result - so long as it is set to do this automatically of course. In practice, I find that pictures taken in poor light and of moving subjects are excellent without having to spend much time correcting images on the pc with photo software.|#|The catch is slightly flimsy on the cover for the memory card slot - hasn't caused any problems however. I had read other reviews saying the same but I took the chance and I am happy with the product.
8.0|#|Compact, excellant zoom and picture quality|#|A lot of features to get used to.  It closes itself down, which would be good if it also turned itself off as well.  Remember to turn it off yourself the battery didn't take long to go flat.
10.0|#|Briliiant video, good zoom|#|Taking good stills takes practice,
8.0|#|Love the 12 x zoom and the fast picture capture. Have got the hang of the basic functions which is enough to go with for now|#|Battery does not last long, had to buy a second one, and it would be better if you could charge battery on the camera, sad you have to buy memory for the camera, and no case for camera.
10.0|#|Picture quality, HD video quality played back on Panasonic HD plasma TV blew my mind. Superb.|#|Battery cover and lens cover a bit flimsy.
8.0|#|HD video with stereo audio and use of zoom during recording.|#|Not much to hold when taking a picture, must be careful not to cover the flash and/or AF sensor
9.0|#|Excellent easy to use with AI turned on just point and shot; also great to be able to see results on large three inch screen|#|Lack of guidance from Panasonic on card capacityies and likely configurations
9.0|#|The HD video capture is superb,as is the pictures.|#|None so far!
10.0|#|A compact all automatic, that's what i wanted and it's good to.|#|With time, learnt the good way of taking it.
10.0|#|Very good X12 zoom. Image quality excellent. Image stability good.|#|
9.0|#|Good build and if you need it to do everything as a point and click then you can. Alternatively if you want your default settings to it then you can set them aswell.|#|Only slight negative is that the battery doesn't last as long as it could and very rarely the mode selection button can be caught and the mode switched.
9.0|#|12x optical zoom, picture quality,|#|zoom difficult to control,acts to quickly
9.0|#|Its very easy to get great photos everytime using the IA functionality. Build quality is very good and confident it would never break if dropped. Zoom is great, I used it in Egypt and got lots of up close photos of monumnets event thought the focus point was very far away.|#|Although I rarely need it, the functionality to manually tweak photo settings would be great. This is very much a point and click camera for people who have no idea about cameras.
9.0|#||#|to easy to push buttons on the back
7.0|#||#|difficulty in viewing lcd screen in sunlight.had to buy a screen cover to take sunlight pictures.
10.0|#|Wonderful lens; bright screen,for such a complex camera , its ease of use.|#|For its price and what it aims to do I really can't think of anything bad. Caontrary to my expectations in the light of slight criticism in the camera press, I think the battery life is very good and the mode selection button is not easy to accidentally turn. In three weeks of travelling on holiday when my camera was in constant use the button had only accidentally turned a couple of times.
9.0|#|Panasonic had done it again with the DMC, wither you are an amateur or professional photographer this provides everything you require. With the zoom capability while filming a video if HD you can reduce what you have to carry around in a convience excellent pirece of kit. It did look at the Canon sx200 is, however this did not meet the all round quality of the Panasonic DMC0-TZ7|#|As yet not found any real bad points which would put anybody of seriouly considering this model again any of the competition.
9.0|#|Excellent zoom facility. Size of the camera is good for fitting into pockets and the buttons are not too small for the larger male fingers.|#|Still miss not having a viewfinder (much easier in snow conditions), would prefer a rocker button for zooming/windangle and would prefer the button that you press for taking the photo to change place with the feature button.
10.0|#|Easy to use , HD video capability ,Panasonic Quality|#|Image transfer slow via PIC Bridge need to use USB card reader
9.0|#|Takes detailed pictures, looks good as is generally easy to use. Can be used as point and click with auto setting or has manual control, if required. Good zoom and takes HD movies, if required. Overall, pleased with purchase.|#|Mode dial on top moves at times during transit, so you have to put back in place. Flimsy door mechanism catch to battery and card compartment.

10.0|#|The main reasons for choosing this camera were the X12 optical lens and very wide focal range.  I like the large and clear LCD display|#|Although not really a bad point, I miss the viewfinder. And some way of coping with very bright sun on the display would be an improvement.
10.0|#|Very easy to use.  Picture quality is very good.  A lovely compact camera that easily fits in a pocket. I love the 12 optical zoom and wide angle lens. Haven't had it that long so I'm still getting use to it, but am very pleased so far and have no regrets buying it.|#|Battery doesn't last that long.  Would recommend getting a second battery as a back up, especially if going on holiday. The instructions aren't very detailed.
10.0|#|Can't really fault this camera at all except....|#|Why oh why don't they put the cables in the box that you are going to need like the HDMI cable with the small fitting for the camera to a standard socket?!

10.0|#|Software which comes with it is very good to quite easy to use.|#|Would of liked it to come with a carry case but  never mind carn't have everything cost me £30.00 for the proper leather case.
10.0|#|Video recording with stereo sound, large LCD screen and my favourite feature is the 12x optical zoom which allows you to take crystal clear pics from a great distance.|#|Battery life. If like me, you like taking a lot of pics and recording the odd video, i would recommend investing in a spare battery. I used my camera at my Nephew's wedding for the first time, i managed to take about 150 pics before the battery died on me, the flash was used in all pics and there was a lot of zooming in and out.
10.0|#|For the money this little camera does it all, the HD filming function, although not as good as a dedicated HD camcorder, does an excellent job for the times when you only want to carry a small device.  General image quality for stills are again excellent for such a small inepensive device, highly reccomended.|#|
10.0|#|small enough good zoom and good build quality|#|no view finder, difficult to frame picture in bright light
10.0|#|Very easy to use.  Excellent telephoto facility.  The screen is of a very high quality making picture arrangement very easy.  The amazing number of facilities make all picture taking very easy.  Having always used SLR cameras I am very happy with this relatively small camera.  I do not miss a viewfinder.|#|Still looking for them!
9.0|#|Awesome camera, the 12x optical zoom allows quality image closeups from a distance. The HD video recordings are incredible quality. I took this camera to a gig recently and was amazed by the photo and videos captured. It has a wide range of automatic settings covering almost every situation. Quickly powers up and is ready to go within seconds. Would highly recommend it!|#|Not really a bad point but you do need a large SD card if you are capturing many images and HD vid.
8.0|#|Quality optics and processor. Zoom range, wide angle lense, zoom video with stereo sound. Price.|#|Minimal manual control.
7.0|#|Excellent zoom range and zoom works even when taking video. Intelligent auto mode is amazing at selecting best shooting mode for shot. Very effective image stabilisation. Audio is surprisingly good despite apparently poor placement of microphones. Controls are very intuitive and screen is excellent. Good that there is a separate activation button for video rather than a video mode and hold down the shutter button - reduces camera shake and lessens chance of mistake.|#|

10.0|#|Small;easily handled;clear LCD screen; good quality pictures and clear menus.|#|Full opticaol zoom only available in intelligent mode.
9.0|#|Image quality is excellent and the large LCD screen gives a very clear picture. The 12x zoom and wide angle were the main reasons I went for the TZ7, however I was blown away with the video and sound capabilities so much so I left my video camera at home on a recent holiday. The software supplied makes organising and editing easy.|#|Only two negative points, one is the location of the mode dial, its too easy to accidently change mode when handling. The other is the wide angle, perfect for close group shots but stay way from long shots of buildings as they all turn into the leaning tour of Pisa.

10.0|#|An outstanding point and shoot camera with a hugely flexible optical range. A variety of excellent features with the ability to shoot HD video footage make it a complete bargain. Picture quality is almost on a par with my digital SLR.|#|Battery life and price of replacement/spare battery. Other than that, I really can't fault this fantastic little camera.
10.0|#|I found this camera very easy to use its picture quality is brilliant my previous camera was a canon  powershot S5, which i didnt like, too complicated for me.  The feature i find really good is the fast shutter speed which allows you to take picture after picutre great for catching those precious moments of your children, some cameras take so long after taking a picutre that the moment has passed before the camera is ready again. very very happy|#|Not keen on the leather case, it looks nice but when on you wear it on your belt the magnet fastening tends to pop undone go for the zip case.

8.0|#|The Leica lens with its 12x optical zoom is the outstanding feature.|#|Massive shutter lag despite claims to the contrary is the biggest disappointment but in all other respects it is an excellent camera.
9.0|#|Nicely built camera, quality Panasonic.  Very good zoom. Nice images. facial recognition.  lots of manual controls if you want to use them.  Pretty fast press-to-shutter time.|#|Zoom is slow while doing movies. The shutter button is a bit confusing - I keep pressing on the selection wheel instead. It doesn't use a standard mini usb connector, yet another special cable to cart around.

Video is excellent, low light images superbly free from noise, Zoom range unequalled in non DSLR range, versatility is outstanding.|#|The only missing feature I would have appreciated is the squaring up of recatngular objects such as information boards and text documents that the Ricoh R4 to R7 possess. This has proved very handy and I will keep my Ricoh in use if onlt for this.

9.0|#|This is without doubt the closest thing to an Digital SLR in a compact form than you can get. Its a top camera, amazing pictures with even the most amateur of photographers using it. Also has the capabilities to do nearly everything manually as well for the more experienced photographers. The video is brilliant too, with its high definition capabilities.|#|the camera itself, none that i have come across yet. The video format is not widely recognised yet (AVCHD) so some video players will not be able to play the hd videos. Its large in comparison to other compact cameras but the tz7 is far superior with all its abilities, especially the zoom!

9.0|#|Powerful optical zoom,  excellent photos produced under miost conditions, easy to get going with intelligent auto mode and point and shoot.  Some reviews have said the battery life is too short - I 'm quite happy at present with the battery capacity.  Getting good photos is easy.  Not a cheap camera but lots of features for the money .|#|High visibility jackets at night give it a problem.
9.0|#|This is an excellent compact camera, my third digital camera, second Panasonic camera after my last one was lost.    The wide angle and macro are excellent for geting panoramics and close-ups.    I notice it is often described as a travel camera in reviews, which is a good description, I have been on 2 trips away and have many excellent photos thanks to its versatility and intelligent auto functions.     According to reviews I read, the battery life was supposed to be poor, however I find it very good.|#|Very few bad points, don't expect SLR quality pictures when you zoom in on detail, but it is still very impressive quality and probably best in its class (as a travel compact).    Flash looks small but comes out pretty good, may have been better with a shoe for additional flash capability.
9.0|#|A good solid camera. If you buy this, you won't be disappointed.|#|None of which I'm aware.
9.0|#|The screen is wonderfully clear. The simplified range of features accessed from the selector on top of the camera is also good. The speed of picture taking is a distinct improvement on my old model. I particularly like the 12x zoom and the 25mm wide angle lens.|#|like myself there are too many choices and I am not able to make my choice in a short enough time before the subject has long gone. Maybe I have purchased too sophisticated a camera for my ability.
10.0|#|Clear View screen. Ease of downloading photos. Neat, comfortable in the hand. Colour rendition very good.|#|
9.0|#|I bought this camera in anticipatio of the birth of my first child. I have therefore found the baby setting on it useful. It records the name and age of the child on the picture.|#|The shutter release button should be where the scene dial is, in my opinion.
8.0|#|Nice camera with loads of features. The image quality is excellent in well lit conditions. In low light, subjects at a distance can suffer. The person recognition works quite well and overall I am very pleased with the camera.|#|It unit is a little chunky and heavy. Panasonic battery and charger so I can't use my high powered AA's. The camera requires a mini-HDMI cable to connect to a TV that you have to purchase seperately.

8.0|#||#|Too many pix to my mind. 6Mpix are enough for making A4 prints. Who is making more than A4 prints ?
9.0|#|Excellent zoom and macro, super quality shots and lots of different modes to choose from, really impressed with this camera and would buy it again with no qualms!|#|Not too much really, the mode dial can be nudged a bit when putting the camera into a coat pocket but once you know that happens you look out for it.

10.0|#|Compact camera, good quality images and very easy to use.|#|Not found any so far.
10.0|#|Nice large screen, excellent zoom, great picture quality and stability control. Propbably the best compact camera out there, excellent considering it can fit in your pocket still. The HD video is unbelievable - looks as good as TV pictures when you hook it up to the screen - it captures everything, no matter how fast. We experimented with filming star jumps, punching air etc and there is no blurring at all. The same goes for the sports mode on photography - perfectly frozen.|#|The wide angle doesn't provide quite the width that you might expect. If you are in a normal sized living room, you would probably get 1 ft extra in additional width than a normal camera (I tried it out with my old one) on either side. The zoom is not especially easy to acurately control - difficult to do very small adjustment. The speed of taking the picture after pressing shutter could be better - as with all digital cameras.

As long as I leave it on intelligent auto it does every thing, it even bleeps to tell me it doesn't want to take a photo. I can't compare it with other cameras, the last one I bought was an Olympus 1.3mp, 9 years ago and still going strong, but I read every report I could find and the TZ7 came out best... I'm very happy with it.|#|The worst thing about the camera is the greedy company who made it PANASONIC, they charge nearly £50 for a spare battery, they want us to be ggratefulbecause now we can't over charge the thing, it has some sort of chip in it to stop that happening.... when was the last time you overcharged a battery?? If your camera was made after some time in June, or had the firmware updated to ver 1.2, you must buy their battery, I tied a cheap replacement and a message came up telling me it would not work with that battery and switched off. Panasonic are just getting two bites of the cherry.. the same way as the inkjet printer people tried. I can buy a heavy duty battery for my car for less.. Still it's a great camera.

9.0|#||#|One bad point is that when you are shooting a motion picture and you are in the sun, occasionally you get sun lines running down the picture and this does not go away when you transfer to a computer. Apart from that the blurring of the motion picture when you move the camera due to the auto-zoom is slightly frustrating but move slowly and it doesnt happen - if anyone knows how to turn it off - great! . So I would say that if you are more of a movie-mode person then this is not the camera for you.

It is simply extraordinarily good, all functions considered carefully and results beyond reproach.  It is the only camera which daily comes out with me, safe in the knowledge that I shall get the results I desire. Not quite as pocketable as the Canon but you can't have everything.  One day I will and until then TZ3 is my winner.|#|Bulk

9.0|#|push with excellent immage stabilzer and AF.  Good reange of features which allow more technical photography.|#|Slightly cheap feal to build quality compared to some major compeditiors such as the Cannon IXUS. Many of the better functions are burried quite deep in the menue system and the camera does not automaticaly save adjusted settings after switch off.
8.0|#|The 10x zoom combined with Image Stabiliser is a great feature. One of the few, if not the only, compact camera with a 10x zoom.|#|. Even at the lowest ISO setting, and this features in many reviews by the camera websites/magazines, the image in low light can be a bit grainy. This is a bit disappointing, as it only gets worse the more the ISO is bumped up to compensate for low light. Then if you limit yourself to only using ISO 100 to 400, you can still get good shots but again the graininess may show if you're printing larger prints.

8.0|#|The wide angle lens is excellent and the zoom has been better than I expected - really quite good results at x10.  The macro lens is adequate - need to try this out more in the summer on butterflies and dragonflies to get a better impression of the quality of the macro.  I like the size and shape of the camera and it's easy to use.|#|Flimsy cover over cable fittings.  Otherwise, nothing really bad about the camera.
9.0|#|Great photo's, great large screen. Very simple to use - the iA feature is very good at selecting the best mode for the situation. Excellent zoom means its a great all-round camera.|#|A bit larger than hoped - it doesn't easily fit in to your pocket and is extra bulky once you add a case.  This is more suited to fitting in a day bag or handbag.  If you want an ultra slim point and shoot  to suppliment your SLR, consider a smaller alternative. However, If you don't have an SLR, this camera is a really great all rounder. Also, I don't understand why Panasonic have used a proprietary USB socket - whats wrong with a mini-usb, it would have made it so much more versatile.

10.0|#|Great design, some camera's are two small and are all about looks, this is a medium sized camera that allows the user to pick and point without thinking they will drop it. The 40 X zoom is fantastic and the ease of use is great, charge the battery and then just take photos, Having taken over 3000 photos in a month I am very impressed. The burst feature is great taking pictures in the snow this year.|#|Why have a small usb what is wrong with keeping the usb the nomal size, more leads and more clutter. I wish it would have a more responsive flash, ie I hate having to wait between pictures and I also want it to be instant when I push the button thats the image I want, sometimes it slow.  Most people complain about the battery, I think with the amount of photos I have shot it is more than acceptable.

I bought this as a simple point and shoot for my wife, what we got was much more. The images are nearly as good as my DSLR. The battery life is also very good, charged it once so far and only needs charging now some 30 + days later and 200 shots on. The Intelligent Auto mode works a treat making this a true point and shoot.|#|None I can think of.
9.0|#|So pleased I went for this one, very easy to use but with some great features if you want them|#|Only down side I found was that the battery needs recharging often. Might be worth buying a spare battery.

First impressions, as still getting to know the camera and what it can do, looking forward to those summer pictures (if we get a summer of course!).|#|Getting round the instruction book takes some getting used to and you have to play with the camera to understand it, mind you it is a good toy to play with!!

10.0|#|picture quality is amazing|#|dosnt have any
7.0|#|TV. Playback through TV very good. Included battery and charger means you dont have to buy batteries.|#|Compared with our previous fuji cameras we are getting reddish pictures with the flash sometimes (haven't read the manual yet however) and find it tricky to press the button to take a picture without moving the camera on portrait shots. This may be due to using the screen as the viewfinder instead of having a dedicated viewfinder as our previous camera's had. Specialised battery hard to get as you need a spare.
10.0|#|A good compact size camera. It meet all the requirements that I wanted from a camera except one. It was one from a choice of three. I like the colour. I chose it for its ease of use and value fro money as well as its high specifications regarding Isos, zoom and Megapixels.|#|The manual is too complicated. It was easier to learn how to use the camera by playing aroung with it.
10.0|#|perfect image quality, light and stylish excellent value for money|#|
10.0|#|Fantastic picture quality, good wide angle lens, small enough to put in your pocket. Great flash, good range of tone and colour. The intelligent auto feature detects the best picture mode ie landscape, portrait etc every time so far. Without a doubt, a superb camera.|#|None really. This is a pocket camera so don't expect too much in terms of manual adjustment, or for decent sports photography - I also own a Canon Powershot S5, which has a dedicated sports mode and manual shutter speed adjustment. The Panasonic has no manual shutter adjustment, but does have a sports scene feature, but to be honest its average, but this isn't why i bought the camera, so not an issue

10.0|#|Fantastic lens quality and zoom coverage, lightweight, compact, very easy to use, well made, video mode very impressive. For those that are interested, as an added bonus I have found this camera is very well suited to infrared photography (with suitable filters attached) as it does not block out very much light. You can compose shots even with filters attached. Results with infrared are very impressive even straight out of the camera with plently of white balance adjustments available etc. Metering is also spot on. Much easier than an SLR.|#|No bulb setting, no flash hotshoe for external flash guns (inbuilt flash coverage is very good though).

Great picture quality and good fast shutter and rewrite speed, which is always the achilles heel of the Digital camera.  Bridge is the right description for this one as you will not get better with heamoraging cash for an SLR|#|Not many, but if I was to really be petty, I could say that the lightness does on occasion make you quetion the robustness of the camera, but unneccasarily so as it turns out.
9.0|#|Manual options|#|None so far
10.0|#|Excellent intuitive menu, easily the best I have seen.  Amazing choice of options for taking photos plus superb 'Intelligent Auto' function.  The build quality is the best I have seen on a bridge camera and nearly up to that of my professional Canon digital SLR.  The pictures are clear and capture very accurately colour, even in low light and challenging situations.  This is my fourth non-SLR digital camera and easily beat even my high expectations.|#|Some people may find it a little odd that the flash never pops ups automatically.  You have to manually push a button to activate it and pop it up.  You have to decide for yourself whether or not to use flash.  Personally I think is is good as stops the many infuriating times when the camera pops up the flash when you don't want it.  To some, including me this is a good point, but to many it may be a bad point.

10.0|#|Everything - fantastic zoom and macro especially. I also like being able to attache a polariser. I wasn't keen on having a proprietary (rather than AA) battery, but like it now as it makes the camera very light. Even at full zoom, the lens doesn't protrude very much, which makes it possible to use a small gorillapod.|#|Sometimes options are very hidden away in the menus. The manufacturer's two-year warranty requires a dealer signature which is missing from my delivery. I emailed customer services about this immediately but have not had a response in 5 weeks.

Fantastic image quality and much better than my previous Canon digital SLR camera.   This was my 3rd Panasonic Lumix camera, which says something.|#|only an electric zoom on it, so not possible to zoom by hand.   Slight bad point is that you have to buy a plastic adaptor if you want to use filters.   Minor points only for what is an excellent camera.

10.0|#|It took me nearly a year of research to find my FZ28, I did not want an SLR but wanted a camera that would do a little bit more than the normal compact cameras to suit my limited buget, so I chose the bridge camera FZ28, obviously it's a bit bigger than the compact, but it is so very comfortable to hold, it's light in weightand has everything I need even shooting pictures and movies in widescreen and HD. For me it's perfect.|#|It should come with a memory card included
9.0|#|The Panasonic FZ28 is very light and compact. The menu is easy to use and there appears to be a setting to cover every situation.

10.0|#|Having upgraded from a Lumix FZ5 to have the benefit of the larger LCD, the improved control layout and easier menu access are an added bonus. The zoom control is better, enabling far quicker subject framing. Being of 1934 vintage, I did not require the additional quasi-video features of the FZ35 and the design of the FZ28 is excellent for my amateur and personal use. I would recommend this camera to anyone not needing one for professional use.|#|None

9.0|#||#|Use of flash wasn't clear on some settings and not covered fully in the manual - it doesn't work when in multi shot mode and I couldn't work out why initially!  I swapped the camera in store as the staff couln'd work it out either then I twigged what was going wrong...!!  Quite funny really!  Still really like it!
9.0|#|we wanted the next stage up from a small compact and this fits our needs brilliantly. It's 18 x zoom gives good pictures over distances, and has a fairly easy to follow menu system for various different situations. The colour quality is vibrant, and when playing back pictures within the slideshlow mode it provides accompanying music.|#|The various playback options are a little confusing.

10.0|#|The best bridge camera you can buy. I had the previous model but the 18x zoom is perfect. You can get over reliant on the auto settings because it takes such good pictures, however, have a good fiddle and you will be surprised just how well the camera performs in most lighting conditions. Another huge advantage is that this camera makes movies in true 1080p HD. It doesnt brand itself as such but if you look under the settings it shows it in black and white, and as the lens is so good the filming is excellent. I dont need to carry around my DVD recorder anymore as this out performs it.|#|Sound recording is not great when recording films

10.0|#|A truly excellent camera for the money.  Lovely build quality and great photos.|#|When not in use the lense shade does not clip on upside down (sorry don't know how to explain it!) so when you put the camera in the case you have to remove it or just place it loosely instead of just turning it round so that it clips back on whilst not needed.
9.0|#|Excellent optical zoom (can be extended even further optically by reducing resolution down from 8 to 5 or 3 megapixels ); very good wide angle too; easy to operate; good battery life; seems to be well built; good range of manual controls but also very good as an automatic. Like having a manual flash button to open flash rather than automatic.Good LCD screen. A good bridge camera - not as bulky as DSLR but substantial enough and yet fairly lightweight.|#|None specifically yet, although it could be improved with a folding LCD screen which  I suppose may occur in a subsequent model ( high shots are OK though because of LCD high angle setting -it would have been good if there was a low angle setting too)

The camera tucks away easily whilst I am using binoculars but is quickly brought to hand and made ready for use when required.|#|The finger grips on the lens cap catch are fine when removing it but irritatingly difficult to get hold of as the cap swings on its string.

9.0|#|Good value. Good photos. Fast locking an quiet autofocus. Wide angle 28mm  to superzoom 512mm range is very useful. Excellent AUTO mode, it will even switch automatically to macro if needed. Light weight. Long battery life. Works well in low light. Most of the controls are easy to access and to use , though the shutter button is not ergonomically positioned for my fat fingers. The face recognition works well. The explanations shown in the mode selection and menus is very helpful.|#|No Hotshoe or PC flash socket. The power zoom is twitchy and frustrating to set quickly - I would prefer a manual zoom ring. No 'B' bulb shutter speed for long exposures.( the starry sky mode is not quite the same as 'B').  No remote shutter release socket for tripod work. The focal length of the lens is shown as percentage which means nothing to me. eg when taking portraits what percentage is equivalent to an 80mm lens?  Unfortunately these omissions take it from being a good semi-pro camera to a just another compact camera, but bulky and with a long lens.

10.0|#|Can be as easy or a complex as you want it to be, its quick to use in a rush for those on the spot photos and it stores large pictures at a sensible speed as long as you have a good fast memory card.|#|I haven't found anything im not happy with
9.0|#|Fantastic zoom and picture quality.|#|It does so much it takes a while to read the manual !!
10.0|#|best optical zoom in a hybrid on the market - very quick start up time|#|can't seem to find a water proof housing for it - it appears that Panasonic make housings for other models but not this one

7.0|#|Lot of features, good lense, easy to use, image stabilizer, raw mode, good video|#|FULL OF NOISE, ISO performance very bad above 200
10.0|#|Switches on very fast so unlikely to miss a shot. Battery lasts about 5 days if you took about 300 pics per day using the eyepiece. Actually has a battery guage so you know how long it will last. Dials seem to be in the right place for controlling the camera. Very lightweight and comfortable to hold. Loads of different scene types so easy to take the perfect picture for every setting. 12 megapixel so very high quality pictures. Advance user settings like grid, histogram and overexposure highlight make this a good camera for the slightly more experienced photographer. Overall a nice starter DSLR camera.|#|Easy to move the single to timed shot dial instead of the on/off switch as very close together. Not all the scene type settings allow you to use the 4x digital zoom. This particular model has no video function. As it's a micro four thirds lens system there aren't many lenses at the moment but I believe more are coming out. There is also an adapter ring you can buy to mount normal lenses.
9.0|#|Tiny, fully spec'd, large screen and usable large electronic viewfinder. Very customizable and nicely laid out buttons.|#|On low light conditions this camera seems to have a harder time with shutter lags, screen readability, noise, manual focusing... but you can manage with some practice. If that's not your usual environment for shooting, then this camera is a wonderful compact camera. Lens selection very limited at the moment.
9.0|#|Small and light for a 'DSLR'. Good size screen and good viewfinder. Comfortable to use. Quick response.|#|Manual difficult to follow with so much cross referencing. Unable to use second source batteries. Original batteries expensive

IMAGE STABALISATION EXCELLENT.  CONSIDERED NIKON AND CANON BUT QUALITY WISE FOR THIS MONEY PANASONIC MILES BETTER|#|CANNOT THINK OF ANY BAD POINT FOR THIS CAMERA EXCEPT MAYBE THE INSTRUCTIONS COULD BE EASIER TO USE

9.0|#|Great camera and small enough to take everywhere !|#|
10.0|#|the fact it has a view finder to use in sunny weather|#|a bit on the heavy side
10.0|#|For its compactness, price and weight (I want a camera I'm happy to carry around everywhere) its image quality and flexibility is excellent. Auto is very easy to use with good results while you learn all the other functions!|#|

9.0|#|Very good image quality straight out the can, better than expected low light performance, good performance in mixed lighting. more features than you need, I find it more satisfying to use than my Sony A350 and puts its live view in the shade.|#|It says a lot when all I can find wrong is a little used feature I wished it had (1x1 image format) Firmware update please Panasonic.
8.0|#|The LCD screen is great, being able to alter the angle of the screen is a great feature.|#|Nothing major as yet.  Although I would prefer the strap to clip onto the camera rather than threaded on, doesn't feel too secure.
10.0|#|exellent camera best ive ever owned n well impressed with its abilites|#|no i can think off
7.0|#||#|No Video Record Facility
9.0|#|I didnt want to fork out on a new release piece of kit , niether bothered about  video, but very keen on the rotating LCD  monitor. As a end of range camera the Panasonic DMC  G1 filled the gap and once I famillarised the many programmes it turned out to be just what was required. Plenty of opitions to become creative also a intellgent auto mode if in a hurry . The supplied 14-45 mm Lumix lens will turn out to be a good work horse in its own right a little disappointed at its total length at max zoom.|#|Lens release button  easily depressed by accident when taking the main weight of camera in left hand.

10.0|#|Really easy to use, especially as a beginner. The picture quality is great. Quick to take photos.|#|
8.0|#|Lightweight and compact ,impressed overall with its ease of ease of use|#|none realy,pity no movie
10.0|#|Not only does the Panasonic look great but it really delivers in terms of picture quality and ease of use. The viewiing screen is really clear and the features are easy to find (without even reading the manual).|#|Sometimes when I put my camera back into it's case the off switch turns to on, so it would be good to have a more positive off switch or way of locking the camera once it has been switched off.
9.0|#|easier to understand and use the features than other cameras .  superb quality of image and build , really hard to fault in any way . I wanted a compact that gave top quality and a wide angle lens  but was easy for the rest of the family to use , this camera has fulfilled those needs perfectly . It has allthe features I need without useless gimicks .|#|it seems if i want a spare battery then i have to buy genuine , as the chaeper generic brands don't work withy the latest firmware in this camera . However the battery life has exceeded my expectations by far even using flash a lot so the battery really isn't too important.
9.0|#|The ability to automatically select the setting to suit the picture you want to take.|#|The dial can get nudged onto the wrong setting easily unintentionally.

9.0|#|Very easy to get first class pictures even if. like me, you are not a camera buff.|#|There are a lot of, opyions programmed into the camera, but it is not alweays obvious how to utilise them quickly and consulting ther handbook takes quite a long time because it dodges from one page to another to complete a process.

8.0|#|easy to use just read the booklet , picture quality is very good|#|none as yet
9.0|#|Amazing zoom, and an amazingly wide angle! You don't have to go a mile away to get pictures of big groups, etc. Fantastic quality of pictures so far, both close up and far away. Great colours. Enough features to keep most people happy. I would definitely reccomend this for any amateur or professional who wants a compact camera that will deliver.|#|I would say the size is a slight disadvantage - it can be kept in a large enough pocket, but maybe not so good for someone who needs something that fits neatly away. Also the menus can take a bit of getting used to, but are not impossible to navigate.

10.0|#|Being a novice, this camera looked good and had positive reviews. The wide angle from the start is brilliant for capturing the family group in one shot without have to organise them! The iA feature is brilliant! Sorts all the focus issues and light adjustments, aboslutely brilliant value for money!|#|

10.0|#|Easy to use. LCD screen excellent, even with a protector added. Battery life excellent. Nice weight to carry in pocket.|#|Image processing a bit slow
10.0|#|Simple to use yet provides excellent quality under all conditions. The Leica lens is superb.|#|Viewing screen is very prone to glare from the sun or other light source. This results in taking the photograph blind. It becomes, literally, a point and shoot camera.
8.0|#|Very good quality camera. Numerous functions and features. Excellent picture quality. Massive zoom. Feels expensive, but decent value for money.|#|The instructions manual is HUGE and have not had time to read up on all the functions, so am not using the camera to its full potential. It's slightly bulky, but it's not an issue as it should be expected of a camera of this sophistication. Will take me a while to start using it properly. You could use it as a point and shoot, but it has so much more to offer, it would be wasted.
10.0|#|The picture clarity for distant objects is fantastic, it is pocket size, the features are brilliant, you would expect a camera of this quality to cost much more than it does.|#|

9.0|#|Excellent quality and build , easy to use and very good value, leica lens at this price is also super value. i have always had canon cameras so was a bit apprehensive to change but defo no regrets|#|only critism is that it can be slippery to hold on to  even with such good quality materials the wrist tag is very much needed
8.0|#|Product had problem after 1 month with display, very fast and good customer service of Panasonic|#|
8.0|#|Bought this camera for close up photos of insects and to take pics at concerts. Great for both purposes.|#|Controls are a bit small and fiddly.
10.0|#|Fantastic little camera,  Easy to use once you orient yourself round the menus.  Superb picture quality and very intellegent.|#|You cant see the screen in the sun, this is a univerasl problem.  Also should come with a case as I havent found one to fit it yet.
9.0|#|good image,basics easy to use but haven't attempted the really clever stuff yet. Bought it for a trip to Australia and was really pleased with the results. Proper instruction booklet rather than a CD much appreciated.|#|
9.0|#|Very good size for such an impressive zoom. The large screen is also invaluable especially if your eyesight has seen better days. Pictures are crisp and clear.|#|The only problem with any screen is when taking outdoor shots with the light behind you. I really miss the benefits of a viewfinder.
10.0|#|Great camera, would recommend this to anyone looking for an upgrade|#|
9.0|#|Different feature and photo options.|#|Battery life is poor so you are forever charging it up. Looking for replacement batteries will set you back over £30

9.0|#|Lots of different options to learn but, it's point and shoot is good and takes a lot of hard work out of the equation for a good picture.|#|Despite a good solid build, it is very surprising how easy sand can penetrate behind the lens and as such, make it malfunction which it sadly is now doing having dropped it at the beach. Up to then, it was functioning perfectly and producing really good results.

8.0|#|Bought this camera because we wanted to have decent camera that we could take anywhere with us and that was easy to use. We were not disappointed. It is so easy to use and the big viewing screen is very effective. The pictures on the computer and once printed are good quality. The colours are true and natural.|#|Only one, but that goes with all compact cameras. The inbuilt flash is not very effective and the shutter delay is a little frustrating.

The ZX1 has very similar controls and features including the IA (Inteligent Auto) and Lecia lenses. very happy with it so far.|#|I'm glad i've got finger nails the buttons are very small, but so is the camera so i supose you can't have it both ways.

Plenty of features on offer.|#|Would be nice to have a case of some sort included even if it's just a cloth bag which could be used to clean the screen.
10.0|#|Very good image quality, and the auto functions make it quick and easy to get going.

8.0|#|Overall it's a great camera - nice and compact in comparison to it's newer version (which is a grade up).  I'm not clear how much the iA feature helps - maybe that's just me, a non-techie.|#|Not so good for spur of the moment shots as it doesn't load up fast enough and it doesn't capture the shot fast enough after you press the shutter release.  Far too many picture options - I'm sure some of them are the same as others.
10.0|#|Easy to use|#|None
8.0|#|I'd describe this as 'a poor man's Leica' but without the useful split-range viewfinder and (obviously) not the quality. But if you're looking for a compact camera that can give you better-than-compact performance, this is definitely the camera for you. The 20mm pancake lens is a must, and with its f1.7 aperture, you can finally have things pleasantly out of focus in a compact camera. The noise at anything higher than 200 ISO is I think a bit high, and dynamic range is not as good as a DSLR, obviously, but under the right conditions, it performs very well indeed. The price is a little high, I think, but the build quality certainly better than the Olympus Micro two-thirds. I bought an adaptor to take my old Nikon lenses which is a great feature, although focussing can be tricky, especially in sunlight - I aim to get the viewfinder accessory at some point. All in all a worthy addition to the camera bag. Small, light, high quality, and without the constraints of a heavy DSLR. Great fun.|#|Pricey, ISO gets noisy above 200 asa and dynamic range could be better. Lenses hugely expensive.
9.0|#|Light weight, selection of lenses and ease of use. Image stabilizer and optional external viewfinder.|#|External viewfinder is a little pricey
9.0|#|excellent image quality|#|no stabilizer on pancake lens
10.0|#|If your thinking of buying this camera then you probably already know a little about it already. Its the new mirrorless DSLR systems. This is not going to the job of a Canon 7D for example, but i do love it. I found myself using it more than i would my standard DSLR because its smaller and not so obtrusive. I really dislike carrying around a huge camera and then whipping it out to take a photo and drawing attention to yourself; i had no problems with this. The build quality is excellent and it feels really solid. I haven't looked at my images in detail yet, but so far they look great.|#|Battery doesn't seem to last as long as a traditional DSLR
8.0|#|Provides many features found on a DLSR but in a smaller body without the weight. An ideal back up camera / weekend camera. Autofocus is quicker than my Nikon DSLR. Was able to pick up and use very easily - have not yet ready the instructions and can use most functions. Buttons are well laid out and its great to have some manual controls /  dials as you would have expected on older cameras e.g. quick fire, timer settings rather than having to go through the camera menus. Build quality is good. Style reminds me of old rangefinder cameras which is welcomed. Perfect size / weight for easy use.|#|Video quality does not seem to be as good as with some DSLRs. Flash may be a little under-powered - shadows are seen around the edges of pictures.
9.0|#|Great Image Quality|#|Expensive
9.0|#|An excellent camera - virtually DSLR image quality in a compact package. The supplied 14-45mm kit lens is the perfect range for me and produces very good results. This camera is ideal when the weight and bulk of a bigger camera are too much hassle (I do a lot of mountain landscape photography and the GF1 is perfect for this) A full range of manual controls and RAW image output puts the user in full control. However, the auto options give good results if you just want to use it as a point and shoot. Build quality appears to be good too.|#|The only downside from my experience is that the screen can be hard to see on bright days. The optional viewfinder would help here, but it is expensive.
10.0|#|I love the fact that I can change lenses and with the 20mm you rarely need to use the flash for indoor shooting which means you get much more natuarl looking photos.|#|This is not for people who simply want a point and shoot as getting the most from this camera involves using the manual settings.  Flash is awful but I generally shoot without it even indoors particularly with the 20mm F1.7 lens.
9.0|#|saturated images from this lightweight easy to carry camera.|#|getting used to the various menus takes a little time but once you get the hang of it it becomes very easy.
9.0|#|very good screen|#|Noise at higher ISO speeds.
9.0|#|A great little camera when you don't want the weight of an SLR but do want the versatility of interchangeable lenses.|#|Would prefer the electronic viewfinder to be included as standard.
9.0|#|Camera body feels nice and solid. Menu system logical once you've spent a while going through the manual. Terrific autofocus speed. Nothing missing from the feature set - and using aperture-priority or programmed auto modes are really straightforward with rapid changes possible to all the key settings. Great image quality from the 14-45mm zoom lens too.|#|14-45mm lens a little on the bulky side compared with what I'd hope for - you'll still need to trate this smallish camera differently to a compact unless you shell out for the 20mm pancake lens too - so this means a proper camera bag, at which point the benefits over a bigger, heavier dSLR start to become marginal. Lens also feels a bit plasticky if you've been used to pre-digital-era high-quality optics. Popup flash also looks a bit flimsy, but this probably won't be an issue.

10.0|#|EXCELENT CAMERA, very easy to use and handy to carry in pocket|#|It does't come with a semi-hard case, but these are cheap enough online.
9.0|#|This is a really well built, compact little camera; easy to pop in a pocket (but do use a soft bag to protect the screen).  Despite what I had read about the screen having a narrow angle of viewing I have found it very acceptable.  So far the screen has been easy to see but I have not yet tried it in brilliant sunlight.|#|stuff.  However the default settings have been fine so far.
10.0|#|It has everything you need to take great pictures - wide angle lens with 5X optical zoom (digital zoom is only really of use if you're using it to find things at a distance, it doesn't improve your picture any); 12M pixels; face detection; HD quality movies; and the intelligent auto button saves fiddling with modes if you're in a hurry.|#|Red eye correction doesn't really work but I've never known this to work well in cameras ever anyway - it's a feature of the subjects' eyes more than anything and it can be corrected when editing the shots; and the picture quality of the LCD screen isn't too brilliant when lining up shots, though is great for playback.
10.0|#|this little camera has so many features crammed in and it is so easy to use. I am not at all technically minded!  I am amazed at the quality of the pictures and I am constantly finding different features. (maybe because I didnt read the manual) Two friends have purchased similar models because of my recommendation.|#|There are none that I have found.
9.0|#|Great pictures from such a small camera and the wide angle lens is a bonus. Good to carry round when out walking as the SLR is too big and heavy so this is just ideal to capture things we would otherwise have missed.|#|Still getting used to much smaller controls!

9.0|#|Much quicker to point and shoot than the three previous Panasonics that we've had.  Image quality is good although they seem to have done away with the Leica lens on this one.|#|The same old same old with these Panasonics and the reason that we've had four now (you'd have think we'd have learned by now) - the battery and memory card holder is still flimsy and still feels liable to break (as it has done before0.  You'll see the same point on most reviews I'd imagine.

9.0|#|Easy to use, camera looks more expensive than it is, great Lumix lens which is more important than number of pixels. For the price it is a bargain! The Lumix lens is the only reason I bought it.|#|I thought the 720p HD video would give better results....it's not too bad though....but I guess the camera's primary function is to take great photos, not video....HD video is secondary.....if you want great HD video then buy a dedicated HD camcorder costing a lot more money :)

9.0|#|Camera is really easy to use, takes good photos, macro shots especially, has lots of different modes to get the picture exactly how you want it. Really good value for money.|#|I would have liked to be able to vary the shutter speed, the only way to do it is to use the starry sky mode which you can't use in the day or it kind of blinds the camera because daytime light is too bright.

9.0|#|Very thin  and compact, you hardly notice it in your pocket - just what we wanted.. Nice and easy to use but with loads of optional modes and features for a small camera, most which look like they'll be useful at some time.  Starts up quickly and takes very acceptable photos and HD video without fuss. Made a neat pouch for it from an old Specsavers glasses case - cost zero  except a few minutes time with scissors and sewing machine.|#|Downloading from the camera can be painfully slow at under 1mb/sec which can take ages especially if you have some HD video at 4mb/sec. so recommend getting an SDHC card reader for a few pounds which is around 10 times faster.
9.0|#|Does what it says on the box.|#|The software is not as good as one I already use. But it would be fine if you did not have alternative photo software.

9.0|#|Great value camera. I'm not an expert but have had several digital cameras and for the money it's amasing. Quality photos and feels good too. Girlfriend now about to get one also. Had comments on trip to Italy from people saying 'nice camera'. Buy the 16gb memory card, tho, as 12 megs does east into the memory especially if taking movies.|#|The camera is slow to start up. You have to wait a couple of extra seconds to wait for the words 'normal picture' to show before you can take a photo or zoom. Also, the image is lost in bright light.
9.0|#|Picture quality is extremely good (considering it is essentially a low cost compact).  Very easy to set up and use, works very well on intelligent auto, you won't be disappointed!.  Highly recommended.|#|None.

9.0|#|Well made and intuitive to use. Lots of choices about picture format and quality are available. Used it extensively on my last holiday abroad and found it to be excellent. The Intelligent Auto Function made taking good photographs easy. Found that the ability to put the 'Rule of Thirds' grid on screen made composing landscape scenes that much easier and led to better looking photographs. Fantastic camera for the price that I paid.|#|Minor point. Zoom not available in video mode.
10.0|#|Fatastic camera, great picture quality (exposure preview is a great feature), scene modes are good, pretty quick, and has already survived a very active holiday where we were using it all the time.

8.0|#|Nice looking camera, BUT and its a big BUTTT. When veiwing at the screen to take a photo the scree has a blue haze over the image, it can be screen wide or in thick bars.

8.0|#|Focus and lens good. Camera feels good as build quality is robust.|#|Zoom button a bit crude, no sensitivity.
9.0|#|Nice big screen and feels like quite a quality build. I'd recommend it if you don't have too much to spend / don't want to be lumbering an SLR around - but still want rich, clear and detailed images from your holidays / nights out / special occasions etc.|#|Can be difficult to see the screen in very bright sunlight, but this is no different to other compact cameras I have used.
9.0|#|it is too early to answer any of the above - being a slow reader and my brain is no longer a sponge i take some time in getting used to the modern laguage that is used to describe actions.  I have followed the instructions through to the basics and the results have been excellent. however i still have to use the camera fully. So once this has been achieved, i can come back to you. What i would like to say is that the camera arrived earlier than specified and in good condition. mny tks|#|

10.0|#|Very easy to use, attractive and great picture quality. Intelligent auto is ideal for point and shoot users.|#|Only small negatives, pictures taken in low light are not as good quality wise, but this is to be expected from most low budget cameras and its certainly better than my old one! The only other slight negative is that the cover over the battery is made from plastic (rest of camera is metal) so it feels a bit flimsy, but I'm sure it will be fine!

Easy to use, light, I'm pleased with my purchase.|#|I needed an additional memory card, didn't realise  when I purchased the camera.  Camera itself only holds about 10 pics.
10.0|#|Very simple to aim and shoot with Intelligent Auto.     Easy to turn of flash when not required.   on screen instructions very clear.    Nice product and good value.|#|Does not have a viewfinder IF that is important
8.0|#|There are so many sales on now so make sure you check out prices.|#|None that I have come across yet..
8.0|#|Battery life is very good.  I've had this camera 6 weeks and have only charged the battery twice despite taking many photos to get used to some of the settings.  Inserting the battery and memory card (bought separately) was easy.  There is an easy menu to change settings, although I don't know what everything does yet.  The video mode is pretty good and lasts up to 8 minutes or so.  For a point and shoot camera it is also really good as it can just be left in automatic mode.  All the pictures I have taken so far appear to be sharp.  Finally downloading pictures to my laptop was very quick and simple.|#|The casing is a little plasticky for my liking.  I also haven't found a manual to understand what all the settings on the camera do yet, although I suspect that it is somewhere on the disc provided.

9.0|#|Well made and intuitive to use. Lots of choices about picture format and quality are available. Used it extensively on my last holiday abroad and found it to be excellent. The Intelligent Auto Function made taking good photographs easy. Found that the ability to put the 'Rule of Thirds' grid on screen made composing landscape scenes that much easier and led to better looking photographs. Fantastic camera for the price that I paid.|#|Minor point. Zoom not available in video mode.
8.0|#|Nice looking camera, BUT and its a big BUTTT. When veiwing at the screen to take a photo the scree has a blue haze over the image, it can be screen wide or in thick bars. The product will have to go back and be replaced, I will not accept a repair on what should be a perfect and duly inspected item.|#|As above, it should never have left the factory in such a condition

8.0|#|Very easy to use and set up.|#|Auto focus not so good some pictures on zoom very blurred
9.0|#||#|To switch the camera on you have to move the front cover down. However the cover moves down in ones pocket  and uses up the battery. My solution has been to put an elastic band round it to keep it inplace. Perhaps the manufacturer could do something more sophisticated.

9.0|#|Compact size, very easy to use.  Outside shots quality excellent.|#|Sometimes discolouration when indoors and using the flash.
9.0|#|This camera has everything for me. I have wanted a SLR/DSLR camera for many years but I could never justify the cost. I'm glad I waited. The Lumix G2 is everything I have ever wanted. I am now a committed photographer and I am saving up for a telephoto lens and other goodies.|#|Phew! Cold wet towels around the head to decipher what it means. Steep learning curve!
10.0|#|And i recommend this camera for complete beginners in auto mode or the more advanced with the ability to set all the usual settings. good value for money. don't forget to buy a memory card as  manufacturers  don't usually supply them with the camera. If you intend to use the video mode then buy a fast video memory card which does for both video and still photography as well.|#|So i think the G2 is really good value for money at this time.
9.0|#|I would recommened this lovely camera for this price. Good all around camera. You will love it.|#|Sorry for my grammar, I'm not English:-)
8.0|#|Lot of camera for the money, with interchangeable lenses.Good quality pictures.|#|If not on 'IA' (Intelligent Auto mode) can be quiet complex to work out how to use various features but this is probably because manual is very unclear and you would have to spend hours studying it to work out 'whats what' and there was no 'Quick Start' guide included. Also be careful as the lens supplied. is quoted as 14-42mm. However the 35mm equivalent of this is 28-84mm. so always check this point when buying a digital camera. I think all sellers of cameras should quote 35mm equivalents.
10.0|#|Fantastic camera. So many new inovative features. The micro four thirds system is remarkable. Latest tecnology at it's very best. I can't wait to add other Panasonic lenses for even greater creativity!|#|None, only that it does take a couple of weeks use (and manual reading) to fully understand all the many but fantastic features.
9.0|#|A fantastic piece of kit, all the great points of a DSLR but in a smaller more compact version. Can be as simple or as involved to use as you like with an 'intelligent auto' button or you can delve into the wide array of customisable options... Or just film in HD!!|#|Coming from a compact camera to this takes some getting used to, will probably need to book a photography course to fully understand all the settings on this camera. I would like to have seen this come with a camera bag as standard, but I needed to purchase one separately.
8.0|#|Excellent Qulaity of photgraphs and the ability to use features to get the best from the environment and situation.  Bulid quality.|#|Complex and difficult to understand at times for a relative novice (me!).  Will need tuition to get the best from the camera.  However, that is not necessarily a bad thing and was alwys my intention anyway.
10.0|#|An amazing capable and powerful camera with an incredible number of options. The HD video recorder is superb too. Brilliant shots of high quality and a very handy rotating LCD screen for enhanced image viewing.|#|No bad points to note, apart from being such a feature-packed camera I had to book onto a course to learn how to really use it! Over the moon with the purchase though and pleased I went for the G2 having looked at many alternatives
9.0|#|Fairly easy to use,compact and not too bulky to carry on a day out,|#|Slight lag after shooting, dont always want to shoot 2 or more frames a go, but feel I miss shots in between exposing and the camera being ready to shoot again.
8.0|#|new to this type of camera.  brought model after research from Which.  still learning how to use it and image quality good on camera but not printed yet.  like the view-finder, keeps the carera steady.|#|Bad side not very good in low light, the shot button does not work when it is quite dark so have had to use my Canon point and shot that is much better for this.
9.0|#|and this feature packed camera certainly lives up to the hype. As a novice enthusiast upgrading from a point and shoot, I was looking for a camera that was not only easy to use but also had the ability to stretch me creatively. Apart from the excellent picture quality, the Ai mode puts the fun back into taking pictures and quite often gets the settings just right. With its extensive menus and range of options the Lumix DMC-G2 is a great intro to the world of DSLR photography and will keep anyone new to its complexities interested for years to come.|#|Very few if any, I did find the manual hard to understand initially but reading basic photography books from other sources helped tremendously. The 14  44 lens although adequate, does have its limitations and purchasing the 45 -200 lens will certainly be a future consideration, albeit an expensive one. Apart from that a very good all round experience.

10.0|#|Endless choices about what to do: fully automatic (iA) so anyone can use it as a point and shot camera, and with the intelligent computer system, it knows what setting to put it on; partly automatic, which allows the user to chose a main setting, and change finer details if necessary; and also fully manual, which allows more experienced photographers to take photos with very dramatic and atmospheric lighting.|#|The instruction booklet that the camera comes with is difficult to understand.

I was right to buy this dslr camera as it is the best camera by far ive ever had (and thats saying something!) and its a great value for money.

It feels and handles like a full DSLR and has loads of features in-built to explore and experiment with. You can also add to it with different lenses,it also has a hot shoe for an external flash.You can either use the eye-piece for picture taking or the 3'' lcd screen which is excellent. Overall it is a brilliant package for taking photographs of all subjects.|#|The only bad points about the camera is the manual that comes with it is difficult to understand and its a pity it did'nt have a swivel screen but thats being super-critical.

10.0|#|Excellent intuitive menu, easily the best I have seen.  Amazing choice of options for taking photos plus superb 'Intelligent Auto' function.  The build quality is the best I have seen on a bridge camera and nearly up to that of my professional Canon digital SLR.  The pictures are clear and capture very accurately colour, even in low light and challenging situations.  This is my fourth non-SLR digital camera and easily beat even my high expectations.|#|Some people may find it a little odd that the flash never pops ups automatically.  You have to manually push a button to activate it and pop it up.  You have to decide for yourself whether or not to use flash.  Personally I think is is good as stops the many infuriating times when the camera pops up the flash when you don't want it.  To some, including me this is a good point, but to many it may be a bad point.

10.0|#|Everything - fantastic zoom and macro especially. I also like being able to attache a polariser. I wasn't keen on having a proprietary (rather than AA) battery, but like it now as it makes the camera very light. Even at full zoom, the lens doesn't protrude very much, which makes it possible to use a small gorillapod.|#|Sometimes options are very hidden away in the menus.

This was my 3rd Panasonic Lumix camera, which says something.|#|only an electric zoom on it, so not possible to zoom by hand.

10.0|#|It took me nearly a year of research to find my FZ28, I did not want an SLR but wanted a camera that would do a little bit more than the normal compact cameras to suit my limited buget, so I chose the bridge camera FZ28, obviously it's a bit bigger than the compact, but it is so very comfortable to hold, it's light in weightand has everything I need even shooting pictures and movies in widescreen and HD. For me it's perfect.|#|It should come with a memory card included
9.0|#|The Panasonic FZ28 is very light and compact. The menu is easy to use and there appears to be a setting to cover every situation.

10.0|#|Having upgraded from a Lumix FZ5 to have the benefit of the larger LCD, the improved control layout and easier menu access are an added bonus. The zoom control is better, enabling far quicker subject framing. Being of 1934 vintage, I did not require the additional quasi-video features of the FZ35 and the design of the FZ28 is excellent for my amateur and personal use. I would recommend this camera to anyone not needing one for professional use.|#|None

I swapped the camera in store as the staff couln'd work it out either then I twigged what was going wrong...!!  Quite funny really!  Still really like it!
9.0|#|we wanted the next stage up from a small compact and this fits our needs brilliantly. It's 18 x zoom gives good pictures over distances, and has a fairly easy to follow menu system for various different situations. The colour quality is vibrant, and when playing back pictures within the slideshlow mode it provides accompanying music.|#|The various playback options are a little confusing.

10.0|#|The best bridge camera you can buy. I had the previous model but the 18x zoom is perfect. You can get over reliant on the auto settings because it takes such good pictures, however, have a good fiddle and you will be surprised just how well the camera performs in most lighting conditions. Another huge advantage is that this camera makes movies in true 1080p HD. It doesnt brand itself as such but if you look under the settings it shows it in black and white, and as the lens is so good the filming is excellent. I dont need to carry around my DVD recorder anymore as this out performs it.|#|Sound recording is not great when recording films

10.0|#|A truly excellent camera for the money.  Lovely build quality and great photos.|#|When not in use the lense shade does not clip on upside down (sorry don't know how to explain it!) so when you put the camera in the case you have to remove it or just place it loosely instead of just turning it round so that it clips back on whilst not needed.
9.0|#|Excellent optical zoom (can be extended even further optically by reducing resolution down from 8 to 5 or 3 megapixels ); very good wide angle too; easy to operate; good battery life; seems to be well built; good range of manual controls but also very good as an automatic. Like having a manual flash button to open flash rather than automatic.Good LCD screen. A good bridge camera - not as bulky as DSLR but substantial enough and yet fairly lightweight.|#|None specifically yet, although it could be improved with a folding LCD screen which  I suppose may occur in a subsequent model ( high shots are OK though because of LCD high angle setting -it would have been good if there was a low angle setting too)

The camera tucks away easily whilst I am using binoculars but is quickly brought to hand and made ready for use when required.|#|The finger grips on the lens cap catch are fine when removing it but irritatingly difficult to get hold of as the cap swings on its string.

9.0|#|Good value. Good photos. Fast locking an quiet autofocus. Wide angle 28mm  to superzoom 512mm range is very useful. Excellent AUTO mode, it will even switch automatically to macro if needed. Light weight. Long battery life. Works well in low light. Most of the controls are easy to access and to use , though the shutter button is not ergonomically positioned for my fat fingers. The face recognition works well. The explanations shown in the mode selection and menus is very helpful.|#|No Hotshoe or PC flash socket. The power zoom is twitchy and frustrating to set quickly - I would prefer a manual zoom ring. No 'B' bulb shutter speed for long exposures.( the starry sky mode is not quite the same as 'B').  No remote shutter release socket for tripod work. The focal length of the lens is shown as percentage which means nothing to me. eg when taking portraits what percentage is equivalent to an 80mm lens?  Unfortunately these omissions take it from being a good semi-pro camera to a just another compact camera, but bulky and with a long lens.

The powerful lens, size/weight, shutter speed, and image stabilisation features will be ideal for outdoors / activity shots, which was my main reason for buying it.|#|I was a bit disappointed with some of the focussing on the early indoor / portrait shots, but have changed a couple of the settings and that seems to have made a good difference.

It has allthe features I need without useless gimicks .|#|it seems if i want a spare battery then i have to buy genuine , as the chaeper generic brands don't work withy the latest firmware in this camera . However the battery life has exceeded my expectations by far even using flash a lot so the battery really isn't too important.

Enough features to keep most people happy. I would definitely reccomend this for any amateur or professional who wants a compact camera that will deliver.|#|I would say the size is a slight disadvantage - it can be kept in a large enough pocket, but maybe not so good for someone who needs something that fits neatly away. Also the menus can take a bit of getting used to, but are not impossible to navigate.

It's slightly bulky, but it's not an issue as it should be expected of a camera of this sophistication. Will take me a while to start using it properly. You could use it as a point and shoot, but it has so much more to offer, it would be wasted.

It is so easy to use and the big viewing screen is very effective. The pictures on the computer and once printed are good quality. The colours are true and natural.|#|Only one, but that goes with all compact cameras. The inbuilt flash is not very effective and the shutter delay is a little frustrating.

8.0|#|I'd describe this as 'a poor man's Leica' but without the useful split-range viewfinder and (obviously) not the quality. But if you're looking for a compact camera that can give you better-than-compact performance, this is definitely the camera for you. The 20mm pancake lens is a must, and with its f1.7 aperture, you can finally have things pleasantly out of focus in a compact camera. The noise at anything higher than 200 ISO is I think a bit high, and dynamic range is not as good as a DSLR, obviously, but under the right conditions, it performs very well indeed. The price is a little high, I think, but the build quality certainly better than the Olympus Micro two-thirds. I bought an adaptor to take my old Nikon lenses which is a great feature, although focussing can be tricky, especially in sunlight - I aim to get the viewfinder accessory at some point. All in all a worthy addition to the camera bag. Small, light, high quality, and without the constraints of a heavy DSLR. Great fun.|#|Pricey, ISO gets noisy above 200 asa and dynamic range could be better. Lenses hugely expensive.
9.0|#|Light weight, selection of lenses and ease of use. Image stabilizer and optional external viewfinder.|#|External viewfinder is a little pricey
9.0|#|excellent image quality|#|no stabilizer on pancake lens
10.0|#|If your thinking of buying this camera then you probably already know a little about it already. Its the new mirrorless DSLR systems. This is not going to the job of a Canon 7D for example, but i do love it. I found myself using it more than i would my standard DSLR because its smaller and not so obtrusive. I really dislike carrying around a huge camera and then whipping it out to take a photo and drawing attention to yourself; i had no problems with this. The build quality is excellent and it feels really solid. I haven't looked at my images in detail yet, but so far they look great.|#|Battery doesn't seem to last as long as a traditional DSLR
8.0|#|Provides many features found on a DLSR but in a smaller body without the weight. An ideal back up camera / weekend camera. Autofocus is quicker than my Nikon DSLR. Was able to pick up and use very easily - have not yet ready the instructions and can use most functions. Buttons are well laid out and its great to have some manual controls /  dials as you would have expected on older cameras e.g. quick fire, timer settings rather than having to go through the camera menus. Build quality is good. Style reminds me of old rangefinder cameras which is welcomed. Perfect size / weight for easy use.|#|Video quality does not seem to be as good as with some DSLRs. Flash may be a little under-powered - shadows are seen around the edges of pictures.
9.0|#|Great Image Quality|#|Expensive
9.0|#|An excellent camera - virtually DSLR image quality in a compact package. The supplied 14-45mm kit lens is the perfect range for me and produces very good results. This camera is ideal when the weight and bulk of a bigger camera are too much hassle (I do a lot of mountain landscape photography and the GF1 is perfect for this) A full range of manual controls and RAW image output puts the user in full control. However, the auto options give good results if you just want to use it as a point and shoot. Build quality appears to be good too.|#|The only downside from my experience is that the screen can be hard to see on bright days. The optional viewfinder would help here, but it is expensive.
10.0|#|I love the fact that I can change lenses and with the 20mm you rarely need to use the flash for indoor shooting which means you get much more natuarl looking photos.|#|This is not for people who simply want a point and shoot as getting the most from this camera involves using the manual settings.  Flash is awful but I generally shoot without it even indoors particularly with the 20mm F1.7 lens.
9.0|#|saturated images from this lightweight easy to carry camera.|#|getting used to the various menus takes a little time but once you get the hang of it it becomes very easy.
9.0|#|very good screen|#|Noise at higher ISO speeds.
9.0|#|A great little camera when you don't want the weight of an SLR but do want the versatility of interchangeable lenses.|#|Would prefer the electronic viewfinder to be included as standard.
9.0|#|Camera body feels nice and solid. Menu system logical once you've spent a while going through the manual. Terrific autofocus speed. Nothing missing from the feature set - and using aperture-priority or programmed auto modes are really straightforward with rapid changes possible to all the key settings. Great image quality from the 14-45mm zoom lens too.|#|14-45mm lens a little on the bulky side compared with what I'd hope for - you'll still need to trate this smallish camera differently to a compact unless you shell out for the 20mm pancake lens too - so this means a proper camera bag, at which point the benefits over a bigger, heavier dSLR start to become marginal. Lens also feels a bit plasticky if you've been used to pre-digital-era high-quality optics. Popup flash also looks a bit flimsy, but this probably won't be an issue.
9.0|#|This is a really well built, compact little camera; easy to pop in a pocket (but do use a soft bag to protect the screen).  Despite what I had read about the screen having a narrow angle of viewing I have found it very acceptable.  So far the screen has been easy to see but I have not yet tried it in brilliant sunlight.|#|stuff.  However the default settings have been fine so far.
10.0|#|It has everything you need to take great pictures - wide angle lens with 5X optical zoom (digital zoom is only really of use if you're using it to find things at a distance, it doesn't improve your picture any); 12M pixels; face detection; HD quality movies; and the intelligent auto button saves fiddling with modes if you're in a hurry.|#|Red eye correction doesn't really work but I've never known this to work well in cameras ever anyway - it's a feature of the subjects' eyes more than anything and it can be corrected when editing the shots; and the picture quality of the LCD screen isn't too brilliant when lining up shots, though is great for playback.
10.0|#|this little camera has so many features crammed in and it is so easy to use. I am not at all technically minded!  I am amazed at the quality of the pictures and I am constantly finding different features. (maybe because I didnt read the manual) Two friends have purchased similar models because of my recommendation.|#|There are none that I have found.
9.0|#|Great pictures from such a small camera and the wide angle lens is a bonus. Good to carry round when out walking as the SLR is too big and heavy so this is just ideal to capture things we would otherwise have missed.|#|Still getting used to much smaller controls!

9.0|#|Much quicker to point and shoot than the three previous Panasonics that we've had.  Image quality is good although they seem to have done away with the Leica lens on this one.|#|The same old same old with these Panasonics and the reason that we've had four now (you'd have think we'd have learned by now) - the battery and memory card holder is still flimsy and still feels liable to break (as it has done before0.  You'll see the same point on most reviews I'd imagine.

9.0|#|Easy to use, camera looks more expensive than it is, great Lumix lens which is more important than number of pixels. For the price it is a bargain! The Lumix lens is the only reason I bought it.|#|I thought the 720p HD video would give better results....it's not too bad though....but I guess the camera's primary function is to take great photos, not video....HD video is secondary.....if you want great HD video then buy a dedicated HD camcorder costing a lot more money :)
9.0|#|quick between shots.|#|
9.0|#|Camera is really easy to use, takes good photos, macro shots especially, has lots of different modes to get the picture exactly how you want it. Really good value for money.|#|I would have liked to be able to vary the shutter speed, the only way to do it is to use the starry sky mode which you can't use in the day or it kind of blinds the camera because daytime light is too bright.

9.0|#|light... does the job|#|Biit slippy to hold
9.0|#|Very thin  and compact, you hardly notice it in your pocket - just what we wanted.. Nice and easy to use but with loads of optional modes and features for a small camera, most which look like they'll be useful at some time.  Starts up quickly and takes very acceptable photos and HD video without fuss. Made a neat pouch for it from an old Specsavers glasses case - cost zero  except a few minutes time with scissors and sewing machine.|#|Downloading from the camera can be painfully slow at under 1mb/sec which can take ages especially if you have some HD video at 4mb/sec. so recommend getting an SDHC card reader for a few pounds which is around 10 times faster.
9.0|#|Does what it says on the box.|#|The software is not as good as one I already use. But it would be fine if you did not have alternative photo software.

9.0|#|Great value camera. I'm not an expert but have had several digital cameras and for the money it's amasing. Quality photos and feels good too. Girlfriend now about to get one also. Had comments on trip to Italy from people saying 'nice camera'. Buy the 16gb memory card, tho, as 12 megs does east into the memory especially if taking movies.|#|The camera is slow to start up. You have to wait a couple of extra seconds to wait for the words 'normal picture' to show before you can take a photo or zoom. Also, the image is lost in bright light.
9.0|#|Picture quality is extremely good (considering it is essentially a low cost compact).  Very easy to set up and use, works very well on intelligent auto, you won't be disappointed!.  Highly recommended.|#|None.

8.0|#|Great point and shoot camera, excellent in low light situations. Feels well made and is easy to use. If you want a camera that you dont have to faff with and rely on it to take great shoots then this is perfect.|#|None thus far.
10.0|#|video quality is good too,  it also has a larger screen, 2.7ins.  Put together with a 4gb sdhc card , it is a great little put in your pocket  camera.|#|If the camera is in constant use together with video maybe the larger size battery would be a better option.

9.0|#|Either select pre-set exposure settings per environment, fiddle with settings or just leave on the automatic setting as per many other point and shoot cameras. Lightweight,looks good in black and nice roomy screen.  Zoom in out with ease as this is incorporated as a swivel arm into the exposure button.  All in all a good camera which takes good pictures.|#|
9.0|#|Well made and intuitive to use. Lots of choices about picture format and quality are available. Used it extensively on my last holiday abroad and found it to be excellent. The Intelligent Auto Function made taking good photographs easy. Found that the ability to put the 'Rule of Thirds' grid on screen made composing landscape scenes that much easier and led to better looking photographs. Fantastic camera for the price that I paid.|#|Minor point. Zoom not available in video mode.
10.0|#|Fatastic camera, great picture quality (exposure preview is a great feature), scene modes are good, pretty quick, and has already survived a very active holiday where we were using it all the time.

8.0|#|Nice looking camera, BUT and its a big BUTTT. When veiwing at the screen to take a photo the scree has a blue haze over the image, it can be screen wide or in thick bars. The product will have to go back and be replaced, I will not accept a repair on what should be a perfect and duly inspected item.|#|As above, it should never have left the factory in such a condition

7.0|#||#|Personally, I didn't like the manual switch which toggles between record and playback modes. Would have preferred a 'play' button with a half-depress of the shutter to automatically switch back to record more: the manual switch I think is a little bit fiddly for podgey fingers!

9.0|#|So easy to use and the image stabilising software works fantastically, so good that our 3 year old can take pretty decent pictures.  The software that comes with it is easy to use and it is quick to download the pictures.  The automatic functions are great and produced good pictures even in difficult light conditions.  We haven't used many of the functions because the auto functions are so good.|#|None
10.0|#|CASE, I CAN'T PRAISE IT ENOUGH BRILLIANT AT THIS PRICE DON'T MISS IT.|#|NO FAULTS AT ALL
10.0|#|I am no good at all with complicated products.  This camera is so easy to use and to look back at all the photos.  Zooming in and out is so easy and the pictures are very clear.  I cannot find any faults at all with this camera.  It is the best one I have ever had.|#|
8.0|#||#|Would prefer a stronger lock on the battery compartment.

8.0|#|Focus and lens good. Camera feels good as build quality is robust.|#|Zoom button a bit crude, no sensitivity.
9.0|#|Nice big screen and feels like quite a quality build. I'd recommend it if you don't have too much to spend / don't want to be lumbering an SLR around - but still want rich, clear and detailed images from your holidays / nights out / special occasions etc.|#|Can be difficult to see the screen in very bright sunlight, but this is no different to other compact cameras I have used.
9.0|#|it is too early to answer any of the above - being a slow reader and my brain is no longer a sponge i take some time in getting used to the modern laguage that is used to describe actions.  I have followed the instructions through to the basics and the results have been excellent. however i still have to use the camera fully. So once this has been achieved, i can come back to you. What i would like to say is that the camera arrived earlier than specified and in good condition. mny tks|#|

10.0|#|Very easy to use, attractive and great picture quality. Intelligent auto is ideal for point and shoot users.|#|Only small negatives, pictures taken in low light are not as good quality wise, but this is to be expected from most low budget cameras and its certainly better than my old one! The only other slight negative is that the cover over the battery is made from plastic (rest of camera is metal) so it feels a bit flimsy, but I'm sure it will be fine!

8.0|#|There are so many sales on now so make sure you check out prices.|#|None that I have come across yet..
8.0|#|Battery life is very good.  I've had this camera 6 weeks and have only charged the battery twice despite taking many photos to get used to some of the settings.  Inserting the battery and memory card (bought separately) was easy.  There is an easy menu to change settings, although I don't know what everything does yet.  The video mode is pretty good and lasts up to 8 minutes or so.  For a point and shoot camera it is also really good as it can just be left in automatic mode.  All the pictures I have taken so far appear to be sharp.  Finally downloading pictures to my laptop was very quick and simple.|#|The casing is a little plasticky for my liking.  I also haven't found a manual to understand what all the settings on the camera do yet, although I suspect that it is somewhere on the disc provided.

9.0|#|This camera has everything for me. I have wanted a SLR/DSLR camera for many years but I could never justify the cost. I'm glad I waited. The Lumix G2 is everything I have ever wanted. I am now a committed photographer and I am saving up for a telephoto lens and other goodies.|#|Phew! Cold wet towels around the head to decipher what it means. Steep learning curve!
10.0|#|And i recommend this camera for complete beginners in auto mode or the more advanced with the ability to set all the usual settings. good value for money. don't forget to buy a memory card as  manufacturers  don't usually supply them with the camera. If you intend to use the video mode then buy a fast video memory card which does for both video and still photography as well.|#|So i think the G2 is really good value for money at this time.
9.0|#|I would recommened this lovely camera for this price. Good all around camera. You will love it.|#|Sorry for my grammar, I'm not English:-)
8.0|#|Lot of camera for the money, with interchangeable lenses.Good quality pictures.|#|If not on 'IA' (Intelligent Auto mode) can be quiet complex to work out how to use various features but this is probably because manual is very unclear and you would have to spend hours studying it to work out 'whats what' and there was no 'Quick Start' guide included. Also be careful as the lens supplied. is quoted as 14-42mm. However the 35mm equivalent of this is 28-84mm. so always check this point when buying a digital camera. I think all sellers of cameras should quote 35mm equivalents.
10.0|#|Fantastic camera. So many new inovative features. The micro four thirds system is remarkable. Latest tecnology at it's very best. I can't wait to add other Panasonic lenses for even greater creativity!|#|None, only that it does take a couple of weeks use (and manual reading) to fully understand all the many but fantastic features.
9.0|#|A fantastic piece of kit, all the great points of a DSLR but in a smaller more compact version. Can be as simple or as involved to use as you like with an 'intelligent auto' button or you can delve into the wide array of customisable options... Or just film in HD!!|#|Coming from a compact camera to this takes some getting used to, will probably need to book a photography course to fully understand all the settings on this camera. I would like to have seen this come with a camera bag as standard, but I needed to purchase one separately.
8.0|#|Excellent Qulaity of photgraphs and the ability to use features to get the best from the environment and situation.  Bulid quality.|#|Complex and difficult to understand at times for a relative novice (me!).  Will need tuition to get the best from the camera.  However, that is not necessarily a bad thing and was alwys my intention anyway.
10.0|#|An amazing capable and powerful camera with an incredible number of options. The HD video recorder is superb too. Brilliant shots of high quality and a very handy rotating LCD screen for enhanced image viewing.|#|No bad points to note, apart from being such a feature-packed camera I had to book onto a course to learn how to really use it! Over the moon with the purchase though and pleased I went for the G2 having looked at many alternatives
9.0|#|Fairly easy to use,compact and not too bulky to carry on a day out,|#|Slight lag after shooting, dont always want to shoot 2 or more frames a go, but feel I miss shots in between exposing and the camera being ready to shoot again.
8.0|#|new to this type of camera.  brought model after research from Which.  still learning how to use it and image quality good on camera but not printed yet.  like the view-finder, keeps the carera steady.|#|Bad side not very good in low light, the shot button does not work when it is quite dark so have had to use my Canon point and shot that is much better for this.
9.0|#|and this feature packed camera certainly lives up to the hype. As a novice enthusiast upgrading from a point and shoot, I was looking for a camera that was not only easy to use but also had the ability to stretch me creatively. Apart from the excellent picture quality, the Ai mode puts the fun back into taking pictures and quite often gets the settings just right. With its extensive menus and range of options the Lumix DMC-G2 is a great intro to the world of DSLR photography and will keep anyone new to its complexities interested for years to come.|#|Very few if any, I did find the manual hard to understand initially but reading basic photography books from other sources helped tremendously. The 14  44 lens although adequate, does have its limitations and purchasing the 45 -200 lens will certainly be a future consideration, albeit an expensive one. Apart from that a very good all round experience.

10.0|#|Endless choices about what to do: fully automatic (iA) so anyone can use it as a point and shot camera, and with the intelligent computer system, it knows what setting to put it on; partly automatic, which allows the user to chose a main setting, and change finer details if necessary; and also fully manual, which allows more experienced photographers to take photos with very dramatic and atmospheric lighting.|#|The instruction booklet that the camera comes with is difficult to understand. Takes a while to experiment with the camera before you know what setting is best for what situation.

10.0|#|Abosolutley brilliant! I am new to photography but ive always loved it. I just recently purchased this camera but i was hesitant because of the bad reviews. I was right to buy this dslr camera as it is the best camera by far ive ever had (and thats saying something!) and its a great value for money. Its easy to use because of the screen adjustments and the touch screen and very light. Ive taken it everywhere with me as its easy and a very handy travel size, i hope to take it on holiday to get some beautiful snaps! Great buy, no regrets!:)|#|None so far!

10.0|#|My husband bought this for my birthday and I really like the features on the camera. It is quiet easy to you once you get used to it. The hardest thing I found getting used to was if you wanted to zoom in, you do it manually rather than pressing a button, bit once I got used to it, it was fine. I now take my camera everywhere now and I love it.|#|

10.0|#|I was looking to upgrade froma fairly good point and shoot camera but did'nt want to go to a full DSLR camera,and the G10 was the perfct answer. It feels and handles like a full DSLR and has loads of features in-built to explore and experiment with. You can also add to it with different lenses,it also has a hot shoe for an external flash.You can either use the eye-piece for picture taking or the 3'' lcd screen which is excellent. Overall it is a brilliant package for taking photographs of all subjects.|#|The only bad points about the camera is the manual that comes with it is difficult to understand and its a pity it did'nt have a swivel screen but thats being super-critical.

10.0|#|Superb quality sharp, bright shots.  Smart camera, feels good in hand.  Good wide angle lens.  I find the lens cap to be a plus - looks good and adds to the retro feel, I'm used to a SLR and always have the lens cap attached so dont have an issue with it.  Still relatively new and and not fully tested but I'm more impressed everytime I use it.|#|None.
9.0|#|This is a semi-pro compact camera. The lens quality is superb, allowing difficult shots in brilliant glary snowy conditions with great results.The controls are intuitive and for anyone with a little knowledge give you complete control.|#|Sunny conditions make the viewfinder difficult to use and accurate composition impossible. I'm considering buying an optical accessory to overcome this, although they are expensive!

9.0|#|Like all Panasonic products the LX5 feels a well built, quality piece of equipment.  The main feature I wanted was the ability to shoot RAW images for maximum flexibility post image capture. Image quality is also important and it does not disappoint on that score either but I have yet to make detailed comparison with my DSLR kit. Although the zoom range is modest by the standard of many compact cameras, it is a good balance for a take-anywhere camera to be used mainly hand-held and the wide angle of 24mm together with the fast f2.0 lens are more useful than an ultra long zoom. The controls are well thought out and easy to use but not sure how easy to operate if you have large hands.|#|I'm not sure about the separate lens cap which is a bit fiddly at times but I imagine it is better and more robust protection than the usual motor-driven iris type found on most compact cameras. I would like to have seen the closest focus at the top end of the zoom range rather than the wide end.  An optional lens hood would be good as would a tripod bush in the centre rather than offset and some means of remote shutter release (although the 2-second self-timer is handy). Good points far outweigh these minor niggles.

9.0|#|Comfortable to hold, buttons fall under the fingers conveniently. Battery life is pretty good.|#|A camera of this quality should be supplied with a good quality case, one which doesn't have to be removed completely (and stuffed in a pocket) before the camera can be used.

10.0|#|This camera takes excellent Photographs, it feels a very solid  when handled. Because it has a faster lens then most, photos taken inside  are better and it also means I can take reasonable photos in the evening outside.  I do like this camera|#|Only thing I would complain about is that it could have a longer lens, apart from that no bad points for me.
9.0|#|Really quick focusing, lovely images, fully manual adjustment!|#|No viewfinder
9.0|#|Camera is very sturdy and has a solid feel to it. Nice retro control for aperture and shutter speed. Manual control of video!  Shoots RAW and 720p video with AVCHD lite. Codec seems looks better than H.264 for similar sized files.  Lieca lens produces good results in low light and it has a reasonably wide angle.|#|The mono microphone is quite annoying. There is some kind of data connection behind the hotshoe which I was hoping would be to attach a stereo mic.  It seems the only accessory availible for this connection is a viewfinder. I have mixed views about the lens cap.  I like the retro look but it takes a second to get it off and on.  Letting auto control the White Balance you will shoot slightly cold looking images on overcast days .  This is a the same with all lumix.  It's not so much a problem as you can manually set it with the camera... or adjust in Photoshop as I tend to do.
8.0|#|The lens gives excellent picture quality, although with considerable distortion at the 24mm end.  The focus tracking, accessed by a single button push, works very well and the separate button for movie record is a very useful feature.|#|Noise about 400 iso is quite marked - 1600 and above is of little everyday use -  and the in-camera noise reduction applied to jpegs is overdone in my view.  Developing the RAW image reveals how much noise is actually present.
8.0|#|Excellent choice of features and flexibility.|#|The manual is hardwork
10.0|#|I love this camera, it's easy to use, built to last with no fancy gadgets. You can get great clear images even in low light and the lens is fantastic for a small camera.|#|None

9.0|#|Well made and suitable as a stand in for a DSLR|#|None to speak of
9.0|#|Unfortunately I have not been able to use the camera as much as I wanted to since purchase, so my assessment is limited. However I did manage to use it enthusiastically in our recent snow storm and aftermath and the images on 'P' were pin-sharp and the colour very realistic. The weight and solid feel is reassuring when fingers are frozen!|#|As everyone points out, the lens cap-on-a-string is a pain but I don't see how else to do it yet. As I bought the camera to use as a pocket camera, the lack of a wrist strap in the supplied kit was a nuisance but I have attached an old one from another camera and it all works very well in that role.
8.0|#|Full manual controls and stunning image quality for sensor dimension|#|Noise artifacts visible at medium/high ISO
10.0|#|Fantastic image quality and sensitivity for the size, by far the best compact you can buy, ideal zoom range (compared to the LX3).|#|... Still searching ...
10.0|#|I really appreciate fact that the camera is virtually a miniature DSLR with all the flexibilty of control that goes with it.  The option to shoot in RAW file format and the HD movie facility is superb - the fact that the camera will also take filters really tops it off.  I accept that it cannot compete directly with a DSLR but the option to be able to take quality photos on a camera which is virtually weightless and which you can carry with you at all times more than outweighs it.|#|None found to date except the high price of a spare genuine Panasonic battery.

There are lots of extra features for more ambitious photographers but the basic automatic point and shoot is enough for holiday snaps etc. that I need it for, so haven't taken the necessary time to try them out.|#|I would prefer to just be given an instruction booklet rather than have to get it from the computer- that is probably the main reason I haven't explored what the camera can do beyond the basics.

10.0|#|Rechargeable battery built-in (good for 200+ pics). Separate recharging unit, so camera is even lighter than others. Easy to use, lots of things that you can adjust but left to itself the camera makes all the right decisions|#|A spare battery would be nice but at the price you can't really grumble
9.0|#|Small and light.  Less weight and size than an all singing all dancing mobile phone so easy to carry around all the time.

9.0|#|Not ha ing used a camera for years, (the last one I had was an instamatic!), I have found this little camera so very easy to use.  If, like me, you just point and click, its perfect, but is also capable of far more.  I did need some help from my daughter with downloading to my laptop, but that is due to me  being not too confident and not the fault of the camera.  I'm going on holiday soon and this camera is going with me.|#|None that I have found yet.
9.0|#|Small and compact. Intelligent auto takes excellent photos quickly. Long battery life.

9.0|#|Picture quality is sharp and clear.  Just using it in intelligent auto mode at the moment, and close ups are very good. Playback easy and a nice size.|#|Only having a small leaflet to tell you how to set it up, the detailed instructions being on CD.  Haven't had time to get to grips with that yet - a bigger instruction booklet would be so much better, letting you carry it with you and refer to it anywhere.

10.0|#|This is a great camera, it is very intuative to operate and takes beautiful bright images even on a dull day. The TZ5 took stunning pictures but this one is even better.|#|None really, except trying to find a camera case to fit. The panasonic ones are all too big, making it very bulky for carrying around. At the moment I am making do with a soft 'computer hard disk' case that I picked up for a couple of pounds.
10.0|#|EL bodies with 5 lenses], some features have taken a bit of getting used to. Generally, pics taken with my new Lumix TZ18 seem quite acceptable from a technical viewpoint seen onscreen, but haven`t yet had anything printed off.  Lens, of course, is by Leica - so that has to be a plus, any way you cut it. The zoom is very handy as a composition tool, and indoor photography is a cinch.  The tiny flash seems to have power beyond its size - though that may be partially due to the fact that we`re not talking about a film-type camera. One point of which I had been ignorant was the fact that the battery has no memory, so if it`s down a bit and you have somewhere to go tomorrow where you plan to take some pics, fine - you can charge your battery anytime, no need to wait until it`s flat. It seems fairly easy to produce good pictures with the TZ18 - I`m 70 in September, and not the most computer-literate person on the planet; I don`t have too much patience for studying all the instructions from A-Zee, yet all the shots I`ve composed with care and attention have turned out very well.  So far, I`ve confined myself to shooting with the `Mode` dial on top set to `Intelligent Auto`, which seems to do the business very well indeed for both closeups and landscape subjects, and anything in between..|#|
8.0|#|Easy to use.  Optical zoom is suberb and stabilisation excellent - could read a number plate at 350 yards.  Colours good and macro worked well as did flash for portraits with no red eye.|#|None really.  It is expensive but you get what you pay for.
9.0|#|Proved an excellent compact digital camera that has produced excellent results straight out of the box. Unable to satisfactorily score all the features as we are still learning to use them. Suffice to say that I will probably leave my digital SLR kit at home on our next trip to Italy and travel light in the confidence that I will still bring home good shots.|#|Length of battery charge time may be an issue, but early days; and it may just need better organisation on our part.
9.0|#|Wonderful lens for a 'compact' camera;  those interested in telephoto will relish the high end, I personally use the wide angle far more frequently in town and landscape work.  Viewing screen better than previous models and there is enhanced video capability.  Changes to software give more choices on program selection dial yet the intelligent auto capability gives the camera more autonomy for the rapid response user.  As I don't like touch screens I prefer the TZ18 to the later TZ20 and the new TZ22.  I only make A3 and A4 prints using an Epson Photo 1400 and the standard of definition is almost indistinguishable from my EOS 5.|#|Camera body less easy to grip than TZ4 and the four-way joystick less well made than earlier.  I also find it difficult to source a carry case.  Consider using a proper neck loop screwed into the tripod bush rather than the wrist loop supplied.  The battery is a different size and has different connectivity from TZ4 and can only be got from Panasonic.  The formatting of the SD card differs from the TZ4 so one needs twice the clutter for foreign travel with the two models.
9.0|#|Light, compact and the Auto feature is excellent. I do some astrophotograhy and the long exposure option gives great results through a telescope.|#|No small, simple manual that you can take with you. You have to download the entire ops manual which is huge and there are so many options it takes a while to learn how to use the camera.
9.0|#|Images taken at 400 ISO give good quality A3 prints|#|Spare battery very expensive
10.0|#|This is definately the best camera I have used.|#|None
9.0|#|Really pleased with the camera in all respects.|#|Lack of a view finder makes it difficult to use in bright sunlight when you cannot see what you are trying to photo due to screen appearing to be 'blank' and reflecting person taking the picture.  However, this product was bought in the knowledge that it did not have a view finder.
9.0|#|Easy to use, just point and shoot or you can use manual settings if you like.|#|Didn't have an English version of the printed instruction booklet.
9.0|#|Small, light and easy to use. I bought it to use alongside my SLR. Not nearly as sharp images, but for the money it does exactly what i wanted. I would recommend.|#|Intelligent auto can be quite annoying when you want to use it quickly so don't have time to sort the settings, and its decided you are taking a landscape shot and not a portrait.
10.0|#|This seems a good camera for me.|#|Could do with a view finder.
8.0|#|excellent build quality. many excellent features , still trying to get the hang of them. very powerful lens|#|very difficult to see screen in bright lighting conditions. would have liked  separate viewfinder. instructions quite poor difficult to follow
9.0|#|I didnt dare to write amazing yet cause I only have used it for 2 weeks. But I am very satisfied. It is my second camera Lumix (Lumix nr. 10 unfortunately was dropped in snow after a ski jumping trip) I was very satisfied with that, so the uptuned nr. 18 is pure ektras for a very good camera productline indeed. I looked at nr. 19 and nr. 20. 19 did miss a key feature, and 20 had to many I probably could live without. nr. 18 is a very good choise for me for family pictures and some video recordings. And for travelling it has been super, quick and nice to handle.|#|Havent found any one yet. :)
9.0|#|It's Panasonic so built superbly and feels solid like it's carved from a block of something, but not heavy. The huge screen is very bright and crisp and the controls and menus are very straightforward even though there are so many options. Intelligent Auto is the everyday mode and actually works out what your subject is before setting the camera to suit it - you can see the mode change when you point at someone's face or at a landscape - brilliant! Battery lasts well and charges quickly. Perfect compromise with big camera features and a big zoom in something that just slips in a pocket. Mine was a birthday present and I'm well pleased!|#|Proper viewfinder would sometimes be useful but isn't practical in this format, otherwise haven't found any so far...
10.0|#|Fantastic camera... bought to replace my Lumix TZ20 that I dropped in some sand... this is even better!  excellent quality zoom, easy to use, loads of functions plus plenty of scope for manual fiddling.  Good quality movie mode, sound is pretty good too.  Large LCD display screen too.  Nice feel and weight, very robust and solid.  Just don't drop it in sand!|#|None really!
10.0|#|Thecamera is a very pleasing size in your hand, neither too big nor too small and too fiddly to use, perfect!  The features were excellently explained in the CD and their use is very easy and they work well although I have to say I have not used them all yet. The screen is a good size and the focus facilities are fantastic.|#|
8.0|#|I take portraits for a living but the camera i use is so big I dont carry it around with me this little one is perfect for every day shots out and about.|#|This is not an SLR camera, so as long as you don't have the same expectations, there are no bad points.

These are all present in a neat and well made box.|#|I am 70ish, and wanted a compact to suplement my , more bulky, and ageing DSLR. I find the many electronic extras being added to recent products unnecessary for a creative photographer and too much to learn for even a reasonably intelligent non-techie. I may never use a lot of what it can do.

9.0|#|Great little camera - bought it for my son for his 8th birthday, but it's better than my own one!  He navigates his way around it really easily. It's nice to look at and hold and fits easily into a handbag. This is the second one we have bought as he dropped the first one when the lens was open and it totally broke.  But he loved it so much, we just got the same again - having said that, if we'd taken out the 3 year insurance we wouldn't have had to pay for a new one at all!  Got insurance for the 2nd one, just in case.|#|

9.0|#|Excellent because it is much smaller and lighter than normal SLR cameras but has all the features including additional lens.  If you just want to point and shoot the Intelligent Auto facility is excellent but it is equally possible to use on manual and choose your own settings.  I have not had it long and it has so many features it will take a while to get to know it.|#|Pity the Instruction Manual is not a paper one.  You need to be able to look at the instructions with the camera in your hand and this is not easy reading from a PC!  The touch screen is a good idea but is fiddly to use although you can use the buttons instead.
8.0|#|But perhaps the ability to shoot in Raw, and the movable touch panel that makes it easier to 'see around the corner', both deserve an immediate mention.|#|But I suspect that the battery charge 'life' may be rather shorter than expected, which is always inconvenient. (Moral: Buy an extra battery with the initial purchase.)

9.0|#|Battery life is very good and compatible spares can be got at realistic prices. As I have no desire to take up movie photography I have not tested the HR movie mode and can't comment on this. Taken overall the FZ-150 is a very good camera for the serious photographer.|#|
9.0|#|Video qualities are excellent.|#|Obviously to keep the price competitive but to get the full benefit of this camera a paper manual needs to be provided or available as an optional extra at cost price.
8.0|#|Generally a lot of bang for your buck, but much of it not often useful. Rear screen very good, and fairly visible in sunlight. Very little distortion or aberration. Reasonable battery life. A tad expensive for a bridge camera, but even so, good value for what is on offer here.|#|Several design errors - erratic and difficult video start/stop due to switch position and type, vignetting when extension tube fitted, poor EFV resolution, wind cut audio filter very poor, no audio level control - much too sensitive. Tripod bush not central, and flip-out viewfinder binds on tripod unless a spacing washer is fitted.
9.0|#|very good image quality.....lightweight.........good quality video.....basically the camera offers ease of use for the point and shoot photographer and offers several settings for the more advanced photographer.

10.0|#|panel swings out making low level or high level shots easy. Shutter has no discernable lag. I have SLR camera, and I would say this camera is a great additional to my kit. Great for anyone who does not want to carry around extra lenses. This camera will be great for holidays, where you want to take a good camera, without the hassle of the extra kit to carry.|#|Small size may be awkward to use if you have large, or gloved hands.
9.0|#|has a mic input!), superb image stabilisation and very fast autofocus. Performs something like a much bigger/far more expensive DSLR, with very respectable resolution and range. Very decent battery life I thought, very good LCD and a passble viewfinder, and 12MP images are fairly frugal with the SD cards. This camera has a really comprehensive feature set, it does very nearly everything I could ask for, and also performs very quickly overall. Intelligent-auto mode is brilliant when you're in a hurry!|#|Low-light performance is never going to be incredible at this price-point, but that's the only real difficulty I've experienced: things get fairly grainy at super-high ISOs, but what can you expect from a small sensor? With this many features and at this price it would be churlish to complain.
9.0|#|lighter than my last panasonic|#|controls on right hand side thumb area too close together.   Zoom lever takes some getiing used to.   does not have the ring zoom like my last one
9.0|#|Brilliant for action shots. Very fast autofocus which works well at the 5.5 frames per second setting. shortest shutter lag of any camera I have used.|#|thumb whell quiet stiff. Also you need a large memory card, the 5.5fps and 12 fps settings burn through space really quickly:-)
9.0|#|The camera is very easy to use and the image results are nearly up to DSLR. standards. The build quality is also excellent.|#|None.
10.0|#|Comes with a good manual, well made as always by Panasonic, Feature packed and top value for the money.|#|No second battery backup, and no carry case that Panasonic usually supply in the past.
10.0|#|This is a superb camera, packed with features that provides exceptional quality results. The images are clear, with accurate colour reproduction and can be magnified substantially before they start tobreak down. Lens first rate and very flexible from macro to telephoto long shots. This camera should satisfy anyone who wants the flexibility and power of a DSLR  but with the convenience of a point and shoot. FIRST RATE|#|
9.0|#|Image stabilisation is top notch in both zoom mode and when taking photos indoors without flash.|#|None - it's a bridge camera so don't expect it to fit in your pocket or upstage £1000 DSLRs for professional image quality.
9.0|#|The Zoom lens at 24x is already good but when you activate the inteligent zoom function this boosts it to a massive 32x with no detectable loss of quality. Both the view finder and the screen give good clear image with plenty of information. Plus lots of shooting modes make this an excellent camera for all standards of user|#|Price compared to others
8.0|#|Good zoom range, light and compact. HD video, better noise and noise reduction artefacts than previous FZ models, now produces decent images at up to ISO 800, but don't forget that you will not get SLR quality images due to the small sensor, but for all practical purposes you will get decent A4 prints.Excellent burst mode, and good for close-ups. A good bridge camera, probably the best on the market at present.|#|I also have a Lumix DMC FZ 50, which handles more like a SLR. I particularly miss the zoom and focus control rings around the lens barrel, which are now by toggle switch around the shutter button, and on the left side of the lens. I was also sorry to see the absence of the histogram in the display.
9.0|#|Lots of features, good picture quality and HD video, mic in, great 24x optical zoom, easy to use!|#|Not so good in low light situations, fragile plastic feel in hand...

9.0|#|This is my first bridge camera and have found it easy to use and set up.The settings are displayed on the LCD screen so easy to see and change.Camera controls are positive and for a bridge camera it has a large range of functions.Overall it is a well made camera that i would reccommend to first time buyers.|#|Does not come with instruction booklet.Have to download PDF file.Not much use when you need to refer to it whilst out and about.Only goes to F8,could go to lower focal point for greater field of depth on some shots.

10.0|#|Excellent quality at max zoom range. Good low light performance. Quick response time. I am currently using this as a replacement for my ageing Canon 40D on a trip to the US and its all-round utility is first rate. I have also taken it to two weddings where it produced excellent images without flash under difficult lighting conditions.|#|Could have included some more options in the creative mode. Low-key would have been useful. But this is a matter of taste
9.0|#|Takes excellent images in all light conditions, zooms quickly and maintains focus, captures video of high quality with good sound. Range of effe3cts and special settings is impressive|#|Occassional delay in image capture - so taking fast sequence of images can be limiting
9.0|#|Ease of use. Auto intelligent feature, allows you to take excellent pictures with little experience. The camera has plenty of functionality to allow you to take more expressive photographs.|#|The main manual is on a disk, 142 pages so you either have to sit at the pc to go throught it or bite the bullet and print it off.  The image software supplied is not the best. Other than no bad points.
8.0|#|Minature/Pin Hole effects are good|#|Menus can be a bit confusing

9.0|#|The FZ 100 is so easy to use, each setting has a description about when it should be used and other easy options within each setting giving a brief description each time.  This feature is great news for me as carring around an instruction manual is not an option, great for those who are low end users or with bad memories.  Its speed is another great feature, if you get a fast card, you will never miss a moment again.  I would recommend a top end 30kbs card to get the full bennefit of its speed.  Great range on zoom allows you to get those natural pictures without the false poses that can be manufactured.  This a great all rounder and is highly recommended by myself.|#|Ok had to really think, but I miss the fact that it has not got a mechanical focus on the lense and the manual focus can be a little fiddley.  Some reviews for this camera also point out the noise can be seen in the picture at iso 800  and above, although for me this has not been an issue thus far.
6.0|#|fairly comfortable to hold, immersed with features, caters for those who just want to point and shoot and those who want a lot more creativity, wide zoom range, basic High Dynamic mode (use auto bracket and appropriate software for better results), full hd recording, articulated display, good image stabilisation processing - low light handling without tripod gave surprisingly blur free results, ability to use 52mm filters (great for protecting the lens)|#|extremely disappointing low light image quality, even in good light pictures look slightly out of focus. after using burst mode it can be quite fiddly to select the images you want to save individually. high speed movie mode is of poor resolution and needs plenty of light. lens rattle when switched off, thumbwheel selector too notchy.
9.0|#|Ultimately it's the lens quality that matters and that's where the Lumix FZ100 scores well. I've regularly obtained pin-sharp images in normal hand-held mode, although I use a tripod for distant, telephoto subjects. In my 35mm film days I usually had to carry a bag of different lenses, but the FZ100 provides me with a wide range of focal lengths in one lens. I like the way the camera reacts quickly when shooting fast-moving subjects.|#|Unable as yet to think of any other than a complete instruction book in hard copy form would be more than useful instead of having fo refer to a pdf file on my computer. I sometimes find myself accidentally pressing buttons with the thumb on my right hand.
8.0|#|solid and relatively easy to use, fantastic screen, full high def video very impressive as the sound recording|#|pictures very grainy in lower light and at full zoom the picture quality deteriorates completely, looks more like a painting than a picture so they should not have bothered with the intelligent zoom feature at all as it just tempts you to use it. the picture looks fine on the camera screen but when its uploaded to a computer screen it is very poor.

9.0|#|Great all in one camera, I wanted something with a decent zoom, plenty of features, some manual control for when I can be bothered and not too bulky. Thats what I got when I bought the fz100. Technical reviews will tell you its ' noisy' over 400 ISO and there may be ' purple fringes' at full zoom. I would suggest of interest only to proper photographers with a bag full of DSLRs and lenses. For me as a recreational user taking pics of the family and dog, holidays etc its great. The price has come down quite a bit too.|#|If you have biggish hands you may occasionally hit the green replay button rather than menu select until you get used to it
10.0|#|Particularly kike the fact that the viewing screen can be turned which allows photos to be taken almost at ground level|#|You get what you pay for and for that price I cannot find fault
9.0|#|This camera is very easy to use, takes amazing pictures indoors and out, has a very impressive zoom and wide angle with good image stabilisation - I've taken photos zooming in on people 100metres away and it looks like I've taken them from right next to them. It also has a great intelligent auto feature that automatically switches between portrait, landscape, macro and multi-face recognition/ tracking. The HD video camera is excellent quality too, but I've used that a lot less.|#|The HD video camera seems to be time limited - it takes footage in bursts then stops and you have to start again. Unless there's a setting you can change that I can't find, this is quite frustrating especially as I have a 32Gb SD card, so I'm not stuck for storage space.
10.0|#|Lightweight. First class images at all ranges of the focus. Incredibly sharp images that canbe blown up perfectly adequately for all amateur photographic needs. Almost good enough for professionals.|#|Sometimes difficult to match colours exactly.
9.0|#|Haven't downloaded or printed any photos yet, but on the camera's LCD they look good. Great number / location of external short-cut buttons. Great zoom range. Easy menu. Lot's of other features I haven't discovered yet. Good grip / handling for a bridge / point-and-shoot camera.|#|At the far end of the zoom range quality drops (but expected), compared to my SLR bodies this one feels / is 'plasticky', doesn't balance well in my hand (lens heavier so it leans forward), grip too small.
9.0|#|Right since the day I bought my FZ 20, This is the third FZ series I have had. This is the best by far in every respect. All the features are easy to use. The lens and the zoom operation are the best on any bridge camera to the point where it is really serious competition for SLR's. I cannot think of a better camera to take on holiday. With a decent size memory card you can take enough full resolution pictures. Remember taking full size resolution photographs is not always necessary but it enables you to take just a section of the picture and still enlarge it to what you want.|#|Slightly slower to delete all photos than the earlier camera but this may be down to a cheaper memory card. Other than I for all normal uses it cannot be faulted.
9.0|#|Excellent camera for the price. Controls now better placed for ease of use.|#|Changed the shape of the battery so can't use ones from other versions of this camera which means you always have to be a charge source - or buy another battery especially for this version.
8.0|#|The 1080i and 720p video settings are good. If you don't need 1080i go for the FZ45 which is 720p only but otherwise identical and much cheaper. There are bucketfuls of settings to choose from. I bought it primarily to use as a camcorder as none of the new camcorders have an optical viewfinder. The optical zoom on this camera during video is very good - so much so that you'll need a mono/tripod to get steady images at full zoom.|#|Learning curve - compared to my old Olympus E410 DSLR, it takes a long time to figure out what settings you need in order to get good still images from this camera. Make sure you get the dual PAL/NTSC video european version of this camera as the other option is NTSC only for the americas version as is not as flexible.

I havent yet loaded the CD but have taken approx 300 photos put them onto the computer and i am really pleased with the results. Easy to use battery life seems good too not yet had to re charge after taking all the photos and reviewing as you do. Well pleased with the product.|#|

The zoom range is fantastic and it is a quality lens.  Overall a very good camera.|#|The viewfinder could be improved, like the Lumix G1 and the contrast focusing is a bit slow for action shots.   I think a software download will follow, as it seems to lock out of focus sometimes and you have to turn it off and back on to correct it.

It is as easy to use as you wish, but also gives a full range of manual options if you prefer that route. Not as heavy to carry as a conventional DSLR, but nicely weighted, feels just right.

Also, if you google the camera there seems to serious issues with it at high ASA's...you will only be dissapointed with this camera

4.0|#|the zoom is quiet while filming|#|Very poor build quality feels extremely plastic. The noise in the photos appears as soon as soon as the 10x zoom is used which makes having a 20x zoom pretty pointless. I particularly found pictures in low light apalling.

10.0|#|Very fast shooting, great focus options, fast start up. All in all a great product.|#|The lens that was supplied. Can't handle close ups at all, meaning a new (and expensive) lens is strongly recommended, and barely any zoom.

I also pre-ordered it through Jessops 3 months ago and have not even had an update from them, it was more expensive with them as well (i really must get round to cancelling it from them now!)
9.0|#|Fantastic camera. 10/10.  A worthy successor to the GF1.|#|None that I can think of.
8.0|#|Small,discreet,powerful zoom,gps|#|Difficult to get the batteries to charge in the camera itself-have had to buy separatecharger
10.0|#|I make videos and bought this camera as a habdy-sized option that would still produce useable HD footage on occasion. The clips I have shot so far look great on a big screen.  I use high end video cameras to shoot documentary and drama but would happily use some of the video from this camera. The 50p capture means I can use clips at half speed slo-mo and still have a full frame 1920 x 1080 image. The 20 x optical zoom is outstanding and 24mm equivalent focal length for wide angle is very useful. Image stabilisation is also very clever, just remember to turn it off when using a tripod. For stills, I love the HDR and panorama options.|#|No manual control of video exposure is a limiting factor, but I appreciate this is not primarily a video camera. Battery life is okay, buy a spare.
9.0|#|I am used to using an SLR but wanted a camera to pop in a pocket. I bought this model because the picture quality is equal to my SLR. I love the IA control because I can shoot, in ambient light, without the flash being used.|#|It has taken a while to get used to the small controls but only because I am used to using a much larger camera.
9.0|#|Easy to use on Inteligent Auto exposure. Much better than previous camera particularly in low light. Brilliant pictures. Good processing software. GPS identified locations throughout my Mediteranian cruise.|#|Battery runs down qucker than expected so I always carry a spare battery. Low battery life probably due to the GPS system working all the time even if the camera is switched off. Improved battery if GPS is disabled.
9.0|#|great zoom, a large variety of settings.superb video quality,|#|very poor and brief instuction manual (printed) need to download online instruction manual for full and detailed instuctions, almost 200 pages.
10.0|#|I bought this to supplement my Canon DSLR which is fairly heavy to carry with it's large zoom. I took the TZ30 on holiday and used it in full Auto mode. It handled all scenes with ease. The image stabilisation worked particularly well on long zoom shots. Colour needed no correction and Photoshop was little used....and it fitted in my pocket!|#|Not found any yet.

9.0|#|20x optical zoom, great lens quality|#|no viewfinder, only the screen

8.0|#|Image quality, 20x Zoom, Good HD (High Definition Video)|#|Battery Life is not great as Panasonic's bad design means you can't set the sleep mode any less than 2 mins. When in review mode it doesnt seem to go on sleep. Because the switches stick out a bit, its often already switched on when you take it out of a bag having lost a lot of battery life
10.0|#|The camera takes beautiful photos, wonderful colours and clarity.|#|I could not find any bad points.
10.0|#|Image quality, speed, decent telephoto and accurate focusing.|#|Can't think of any
10.0|#|I've had Lumix compacts for years now and this is a new level. The photos are crisp and clear, and that's for someone who is not a photographer. The image stability is improved and what makes a huge difference is that it is now charged using USB. With the short lead provided, you can charge it from an Apple or other USB charger so that leaves more room in my laptop bag.|#|

8.0|#|Not had long, but seem's to do a lot for a small camera.|#|190 pages to print for full instruction manual.
8.0|#|Have had 3 Panasonic lummox cameras, very happy with all of them. This one is very old quality, fab pictures and easy to use as well as a great zoom ... You won't be disappointed !|#|Haven't found any yet..... One minor point is tht you don't get a separate battery charger,
8.0|#|It responds quickly to changing conditions or tracking a moving object. Screen image very sharp. Video easy to use.|#|the lens is vulnerable to dust, moisture and scratches
10.0|#|Bought this camera as a 'fit in pocket' camera for holidays. It does just that and takes some fantastic pictures. There are a vast array of user options but as a non-expert the IA mode and Panoramic mode have fulfilled my needs perfectly.|#|The online/on screen instruction manual is daunting but the camera is really easy to use and careful selection of which parts of the manual you really need to read overcomes the initial worry!
10.0|#|Easy to use, nice size, excellent compact camera|#|Battery life, can run out quickly. Recommend purchasing. Spare battery and seperate charger
10.0|#|Touch screen that focusses on subject and takes an instant shot, great 20 x zoom, image quality and features|#|None
10.0|#|On the Ai this camera is very easy to use, it takes a lovely picture and a lot faster than the TZ7 which was my last camera. It is not bulky and is light so easy to carry around. A brilliant compact camera.|#|
10.0|#|Great camera for a good price - all i wanted was point and click but i suspect this does more too!  not read the manual though!|#|
10.0|#|this camera covers all my need The panoramic shot just adds another dimension|#|Non
10.0|#|I wanted a very compact camera that could be used without making me stand out of the crowd. I also wanted a large optical zoom. At present it's compactness and ease of use make it a good choice. Lastly, I always feel that Panasonic goods work very satisfactorily for a long time.|#|I don't have any regrets about my purchase at this stage, apart from I consider the user manual to be very short on details regarding basic operation - I have had problems installing the more comprehensive instructions on my computer, and have had to run with the camera away from my home on major holiday without ready access to a computer.
9.0|#|the zoom lens is fantastic, the camera is small enough to fit in my pocket,and it has lots of different modes to suit every picture shot|#|so many modes  you need to down load the manual to see all what the camera can do

10.0|#|Fantastic, best buy! I brought this camera as a lighter and quicker alternative then my SLR. I carry it everywhere!!|#|Only bad point is the Panasonic website when it comes to registering the camera. Still having trouble!
10.0|#|I have found it very easy to use and the 20 Optical Zoom is amazing, havn't tried all of the functions yet still finding my way around. Love the fact you can crop pictures therfore deleting any areas you don't want on your prints. Would strongly recommend this camera.|#|Only point I would make is should not assume everyone that purchases a camera has access to a computer to enable them to download the full manual. As all you have to do to get your prints is go to a camera shop or supermarket.
9.0|#|Amazing zoom for a compact.  Great image clarity - even in the dark with no flash and out of a moving vehicle.|#|None really - battery life isn't great if you take as many pictures as I do - definately need a spare.
9.0|#|Only had camera for a few weeks but it seems to be all i want in a small camera - images are really clear and crisp and video recording seems good.  i love the zoom - amazing quality of picture.|#|Wish it had a manual with it not online.
10.0|#|Excellent camera.|#|You will need a big SD card if you want to record video. You get approx 4 hours from a 32GB card at the best video quality. Obviously this is not a fault of the camera, it is just something you need to consider.
9.0|#|Just good quality photos without too much fuss initially. Must learn what all the settings do.|#|No seperate charger No written instruction manual. Cant take my desktop everywhere with me!
8.0|#|MANUAL CONTROL|#|NOT AWARE THAT IT'S NOT UK MODEL SO DOUBT OVER MANUFACTURER'S WARANTY.
8.0|#|flash performance is better.|#|I realy do not like no printed manual. I am going to have to look at putting it on Kindle so I can have access to it on holiday. The USB charger means that I had to buy a seperate charger to be able to charge the spare battery out of the camera. It also did not have a Video lead, so I had to buy one, the first one was wrong as the camera has a smaller than mini plug. I should have checked in the manual.
9.0|#|Simple to use - lots of settings and functions but also just using auto focus equivalent is just as effective.|#|Lots of functions - probably never use
6.0|#|overall good quality of camera and images. But only when object is not in motion and light is good.  Good features, solid build. I will not buy it again.|#|I will not buy it again.

10.0|#||#|almost none
7.0|#|Fast focus and shutter speed. I like very much the touch screen shutter response. Instant and excellent. Good choice of settings - although if I wanted all this choice I would have bought an SLR.|#|Should include a printed manual as there are too many features for a novice to be scrolling through all the pages to the information wanted on the disc manual. Too many different settings for such a small camera which would be more suited to a DSLR. Most features not necessary for a camera of this size. Camera shake is pronounced whilst taking video, as camera is too small to hold still enough. Needs default stabilising (unless I've missed a setting for it!). In very bright light unable to see screen, as there is no viewfinder. (I live in Spain). On my previous Lumix when downloading to my pc, there was an option to delete from camera after downloading. There doesn't seem to be this option on the DMC TZ30 so this has to be done manually afterwards.
6.0|#|It is a great camera , no doubt about that|#|The software is only compatible with widows 8 which I don't have and have no intention of getting , I didn't know this. As this is a parallel import  local panasonic won,t help me and the model is not the NZ model that they sell in NZ, so I'm a bit stuffed.
9.0|#|Amazing zoom, picture clarity and colour definition - though I am no expert, these really stand out for me.|#|Doesn't fit many cases due to the 'dial' on top.

9.0|#|Having now passed my 70th birthday, I was beginning to find that lugging 2kg of DSLR gear up Scafell Pike, Helvellyn, etc was no longer much fun. I had tried smaller cameras before which claimed that they were almost as good as an SLR, but they weren't .... not by a long way! However, I feel that the Lumix DMC-G3 comes as close as it gets, and is unbelievably light. When I pick up the camera case to go out for a walk I sometimes have to check that there really is a camera inside! To my surprise, I was able to use the monitor on a snow-covered mountain in very bright conditions which most monitors can't cope with.|#|Probably most of these down to the inexperience/carelessness of the user - the touch screen needs care or it may produce unexpected results. Or possibly the Intelligent Auto button isn't quite as intelligent as one would hope. Whatever the reason, a number of the photos that I took on my first outing in bright snow conditions used a tungsten WB when I thought I was on AWB. The resulting strong blue cast isn't very obvious in the monitor in bright conditions.
10.0|#|- EVF is really good (for an EVF)|#|The only bad point i can think of right now is that the additional lenses are expencive.
9.0|#|The G3 is very compact but still comfortable for my large hands. I researched my purchase, as always, for a couple of months before I finally decided on the G3. I think that it is the best bang for buck compact system camera out there and I am not dissapointed with my purchase in any way.|#|, but I would make an allowance that you are probably going to want to change it down the line.
10.0|#|Reasonably compact even with the 45-200mm lens attached.|#|Not brilliant battery life, but I just bought another pattern battery.
9.0|#|Excellent at taking photos of moving object like racing cars. Burst shoot is very handy and takes 9-15 depending on teh quality of your memory card.|#|Official strap can 'cut in' to my neck when hanging for a prolonged period of time as it's quite thin.
9.0|#|It really does make you want to get out and record the world day by day|#|non as yet
10.0|#|Can be as easy to use as you want with auto / programme settings, but with good manual controls where required. I had previously had a 35mm SLR then moved to a bridge camera. The G3 is a good middle ground compromise - good picture quality yet compact and expandable. Would definitely recommend.|#|Price of micro 4/3 lenses - bought long zoom as an extra with camera to get benefit of discount on offer, but would have been expensive otherwise.

9.0|#|Adjustable screen with touch focus and shutter control really useful. Auto focus speed very fast with 14-45mm lens. Stereo 1080i video quality very good for a stills camera. To my eyes adequate resolution to 1600iso. Good balance in hand with both 20mm and 14-45mm. Evf very good especially in the dark as enhances the brightness.|#|Coming from gf1 build quality not as solid. Have already scraped the front and side. However when comparing the price against an olympus om d then you are getting a lot of camera for a third of the price.
10.0|#|Really easy to use, the live view button is fantastic...love the fact the screen flips out also. VERY LIGHT to hold and use.|#|None found yet..well maybe the lens isnt the best...will def need the bigger lens.

9.0|#|I have only owned compact cameras in the past. So I decided I wanted something a bit better this time...Great camera...considering the features it is still compact enough to place in your bag so you never miss an opportunity. Very quickly processes photo's once taken so you are able to continue taking. The 'burst mode' is very useful. I recently visited NYC and came back with some great shots. The battery life lasts around maybe 3hrs or so. I have purchased 2 more so I don't run out. Overall very happy with my purchase :)|#|It's only a really little thing really, but on previous cameras I've owned they've had a colour highlight setting. It would have been nice if it was included. I've not had it long but it doesn't appear to a have panoramic setting either...unless I just haven't found it...I'm still getting to grips with the camera.

10.0|#|Great for beginners who want to take top shots right away. Enough real advance features to take photos further when ready. Brilliant compact design!|#|Battery life.

9.0|#|I have not had the camera long enough yet to be able to make comments.  I have not had time to play with it properly yet but so far, so good.  I like the fact that I can use it on idiot mode for the time being (AF).|#|No comment yet.
10.0|#|Can't really fault this camera at all. I have a pair of Canons that needed updating and decided to go with Lumix G3 and a GX1, and have not been disappointed with either.|#|Menu system is good but it takes a while to find your way around until you find the things relevant to the way you use the camera, although you can customise it once you've found what you like.

9.0|#|I was a professional press photographer for thirty years but after retiring  I stopped using my Nikon for pleasure  - because the gear that went with it  was  too  heavy.  I then researched for a really small pocket camera that had most things on it  - hence my purchase of the FX60 with the Leica lens.  I am now enjoying my photography  again.   Thank  You.|#|
9.0|#|You'd never know that this camera is now a generation old, and that makes it great value for money. The spec covers everything you could reasonably want from a compact camera - the Leica lens is well worth having, the camera is compact and very light, and the battery life is very good.|#|Slight creaky noise from the spring on the zoom rocker lever and the battery/SD card hatch is perhaps a little to easy to open accidentally - but that's being very picky.

10.0|#|If you want a Camera that you can fit in the smallest of pockets then look no further this is it. If you want a pocket camera that is packed full of features and is so easy to use the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX60 has it all. The good thing about it, is that it will still allows you to be creative. The multi frame shotting setting is absolutely fantastic, got some priceless shots of us playing with an Aerobe, throwing and catching. Put it into an Aquapac and took it swimming, the under water shots and HD filming were stunning. I found by conditioning the battery ie 2 complete discharge and recharge, gave me many more shots then the advertised amount , I could be out for the entire day take in excess of 400 shots plus HD filming and still plenty more life left in the battery. I especially like the iAuto mode. Once set it will predict the type of picture you want to take and will set the camera accordingly, a symbol appears to confirm the setting, very handy and neat.To sum up a very neat, compact, and capable, camera.|#|NONE does exactly what it says on the BOX

9.0|#|Results so far are good and have printed out well to A4.  The colours are clear and true and do not require much editing afterwards for exposure though I do have to sharpen quite often.  It is also good in poor light and the flash works well though limited in distance.  It is useful to have a screwhole in the base  to be able to fit it on to a tripod as even with stabilisation it is not always easy  to hold such a slim camera still enough for spot-on focus.|#|It is quite complicated for a pocket camera, not exactly point-and-shoot. It does not have a manual setting and I miss the optical viewfinder I have had on my previous small Canons.  My main criticism (and I can live with this!) is that the screen is very shiny and mirror-like and difficult to see in sunshine when the thing one is most likely to see is one's own reflection.  I have not noticed this on our other Panasonic Lumix TZ3.  I would ike it to have had a superfine setting but on the whole there is not a lot to be critical about and it is much easier to carry around on holiday than a heavyweight!

Excellent image quality and good flexibilty offered by the inter-changable lenses.|#|No viewfinder (optional accessory) and limited lens range currently available, although I am sure this will change.
9.0|#|Nice small form factor with the 20mm pancake lens. I bought this as I got tired of lugging my canon 30D and lenses on holidays which took up most of my carry on luggage and my panasonic compact was a bit too slow in shutter speed. The photos are brilliant! Extremely sharp and great bokeh from the 20mm pancake lens. I'd have to say they are as good as the photos from my canon. I think this is mostly due to the quality of the lens. Originally I thought the 20mm range would be too restrictive but as most of my photos are taken of my kids, the focus range is fine. Low light photography is great as well which is one of the reasons I bought this. You wont need to use the pop up flash generally which means the photos indoors and in early evening tend to look more natural and doesn't black out the background which tends to happen with flash photography. I read on one of the reviews that because the 20mm lens is 1.7 that it lets in about 4 times more light. Would definitely recommend as a second camera or even as a main camera. Come to think of it I havent touched my Canon SLR since I've bought this one.|#|This is not a camera for sports though as it doesnt handle fast action that well especially without an optical viewfinder.
8.0|#|Solid, relatively light, excellent pan cake lens.|#|Viewfinder extra! Very expensive alternative lenses.
10.0|#|The 20m f/1.7 lens is absolutely superb. With an effective 40m it is ideal for me.|#|Still rather expensive !
10.0|#|lightweight, lens changeable, speedy, 23 focus point or face detected, color mode, easy to manage.It is the perfect camera for me especially bought from Simply Electronic with excellent customer service and speedy delivery. Only this website have Panasonic GF1 in white (original made in japan) with reasonable price(the cheapest i have found compare all the website and high street)..Sharp and clear even in the dark with f1.7 20mm lens..|#|need some time to learn the focus system. you will get use to it.
9.0|#|Very compact design|#|Limited range of dedicated lenses
9.0|#|The video is great, but ... unless you've got a very steadier grip, you need a tripod.|#|Speed of focussing, shooting etc. is not quite up to DLSR standards, but much better than the point-and-shoots I've used.
8.0|#|Excellent out of the box pictures, almost pocketable with 20mm lens, easy to use auto mode.|#|optional electronic viewfinder should be cheaper
9.0|#|With this lens,  carrriage is no problem at all , and will do most everything in general uee that most people would require. Highly recommended.|#|
9.0|#|Very fast from start-up, Brilliant image and build quality, Good large lcd display. 20mm Pancake lens f1.7 good quality and fast but also refreshing using a fixed lens. Has flexibility of taking other image stabilised lens'. Good quality movies. Overall a great package.|#|No optical viewfinder included. Keep finding myself wanting to use it as an SLR. Electronic viewfinder available but expensive and lower quality display apparently. Recommend lcd display protector. Flash mechanism seems delicate. Wired Remote trigger only available. Initial findings s.slow to focus at different distances on movies. Consider 2nd battery on long trip.
8.0|#|Compact easy to carry around compared to a DSR. Fun to use and take great pictures especially with the pancake lens. You can get a lens mount that allows you to use leica lens, which give you a wider range of lens to choose from.|#|The menu functions takes time to get used to.

9.0|#||#|Even with the F1.7 prime len, the bokeh effect is okay, but not as shallow DOF you'll get in, for example, Canon EF 50mm F1.8.
9.0|#|Does everything a good DSLR camera does but  is  3 times smaller. Well built and easy to use. If you are tired of lugging a  DSLR around this could solve the problem.|#|The EVF is very pricy and not too good. Could do with more lenses, however it still has enough lenses for most needs and you can put virtually any lens on it as there are many adapters.
8.0|#|I am still getting to grips with this camera but it is beautifully designed, compact, takes beautiful photos, I am really glad I bought it and would recommend it.|#|the manual is almost impossible to follow, really badly written and layed out. I cannot use it at all and am having to try to figure out the camera on my own. I am a beginner so its not easy
9.0|#|Excellent build quality and full of DSLR features in a portable, compact body that feels sturdy and hard wearing. HD Video feature is a great bonus in this compact camera body, giving that extra option to take moving footage. The Pancake lens with a max 1.7 aperture is fantastic. It provides the creative photographer the abilty to throw the background out of focus for added effect. Low light photography is easily achievable too. Overall this is a great camera, encompassing many different modes from program single shoot option to multishoot enhanced picture mode, with video thrown in for good measure. 4:3, 16:9 and HD 1080i picture quality in one modern looking, compact style body. Very highly recommended.|#|The auto focus mode when shooting HD video is somewhat easily fooled into throwing the main subject out of focus when tracking, which can be annoying if you do not lightly press the shutter button halfway to force the camera to re-focus.
8.0|#|Technically its a lot better than it looks|#|It feels plastically and likely to break easily.
9.0|#|Superb image quality in a near-compact body|#|Automatic mode insists on using 1.7 aperture, I have never seen it use a smaller one.
8.0|#|I have discovered the joy of photography with this camera! I was a point and shoot user with my previous Panasonic compact camera. My experience with this one prompted me to go for the panasonic rather than the olypmus or Sony in the same class and though I cannot comment on these other cameras I could not be more happier with the GF1. I have no problem recommending it to anyone but especially someone like me wanting something more than your typical compact.|#|Size. Yes it is nothing like an SLR camera body but if you are use to carrying around your compact in your pocket for those just in case moments the gf1 is still to large to keep with you at all times so you have to make the choice if you take it with you or not. Also because of it's unique size I have found it hard to find a good case for it which doesnt bulk it out further.
9.0|#|The new model,GF2,  is going to be even smaller and lighter. Keep an eye on it if size matters to you...|#|Bracketing for HDR use is not good enough.
9.0|#|The camera is compact and takes up very little room when out and about, which means I'm more likely to have it with me and get those good shots. The image quality is excellent, far better than the small sensor images found with comparable size bridge or prosumer compacts. The HD movie quality is also really excellent, so the video camera is now redundant.|#|As everyone will criticise, a lack of integral optical or digital viewfinder is a major design flaw. The optional one you can buy is good, but makes the camera slightly bulkier and less neat. It is also very expensive.
10.0|#|We ordered the red one and it is awesome (and cute)! I am still trying to learn all of the features.  The photot quality is incredible and it is easy to carry the camera in your purse.|#|The zoom isn't really that good - there are several buttons you have to push in order to zoom and the photo quality deteriorates.  I would definitely order a screen protector and a filter to protect the lens and screen.
10.0|#|The HD video is only 720 but I would only be uploading footage to youtube and possibly vimeo (which I think has a 720 limit) so thats fine for me.|#|

Leica lens.|#|Flimsy feeling mode selection wheel.  Bit bulky but for the level of optical zoom it's very compact.  Wish it had an automatic lens cover rather than the clip on one.  Makes the fast start up a bit redundant when you want to use the camera quickly.
9.0|#|- Good looking piece of kit, combining a compact form factor with a powerful zoom.|#|- video recorded in Quicktime (whether that is a bad point depends on your point of view, for me it is a definate negative)
8.0|#|The 10x zoom in a pocket sized (well big pocket!)camera is really useful.   The stabilisation system is particularly useful for hand held telephoto shots.  Build quality is good and the camera seems to take rough treatment without complaining.  Most of the features are worthwhile when you have learnt how to drive them!  Overall it is an amazing camera for its size and price but is not a replacement for an SLR.|#|The automatic focusing can be slow and leaves a too higher percentage of photos out of focus. For advanced users the lack of aperture and shutter speed controls is frustrating. Some of the control buttons are very sensitive and it is easy to switch on, or off, a feature inadvertantly, e.g. the multishot feature.

It is easy to use, but also offers a wide range of user settings, and the combination of wide angle lens and image stabiliser make this good value for money.  The quality compares with larger and more expensive cameras, and I often take this instead of my SLR, as it is just as good in the majority of situations - without the bulk. The battery life is excellent. The camera will take 300 photos on one charge, and the Lithium ion battery charges in 2 hours.|#|Purple fringing if shooting towards a light source, and poor quality (noisy) pictures at ISO settings above at 200. In low light  is better to use a lower ISO setting and rely on the stabiliser or a tripod. A camera of this price should be supplied with a larger SD card as standard. The video recording is not of the same high quality as the stills photos.

9.0|#|excellent camera fully loaded with a number of features. recovery time of the camera in between 2 frames as well as its battery life is amazing. worth buying if you are shoot outdoor and are fond of travelling.|#|image quality below average (too much noise in pictures) when shot at full zoom in cloudy or indoor atmosphere. variable zoom feature is not very effective.
9.0|#|The Lumix cameras are some of the best compact cameras on the market. We have several in the office and all comment on how intuitive they are and the quality is fantastic due to the 7 mega-pixal CCD and Lens combo. The design is beautiful and has a certain elegance that other makes of camera fail to live up to.|#|It's to good.

The memory card supplied with a camera of this capability is inadequate as at the optimum output it will only store a small number of frames.

10.0|#|For point and shoot I found it excellent. I was very pleased with the quality of the pictures but I am just a basic photographer and only use simple mode. Close ups were very good. My husband, who is more adventurous with photography, has taken the camera over....he liked it.|#|For me it has too many options but no doubt I would learn to use them in time. We had to buy a chip and case for it. I prefer to have the screen protected when not in use.
9.0|#|After doing a bit of research on the Internet and comparing this camera with about eight others, I was pleased to discover that it lives up to my expectations.  For the money I paid, I am happy with the quality and features available on this model.  It feels sturdy, has a top-quality lens and a very nice LCD.|#|At the bottom of the camera is a little push-lever that locks and unlocks the battery compartment and memory card slot.

9.0|#|Excellent highly capable camera - nearly as good as an SLR but without the weight. Pictures are stunning and long range stabilised zoom is an amazing lens.|#|Wide angle could be wider and short range focussing can be inaccurate sometimes. Digital viewfinder is too small.

6.0|#|The ability to take hundreds of photographs without changing film, to view and delete those you do not like and to see them on your PC or TV without waiting or paying for developing is the real big break through with digital photography.|#|I thought Digital photography would be more user friendly than manual SLR but it introduces menus that offer more choices and greater complications.
8.0|#|Excellent camera for the money. Like the options available for Aperture/Shutter priority and manual control.|#|Electronic viewfinder poor quality. Requires an increase in the pixel count.No protection on the front of the lens such as a UV or Haze filter.

10.0|#|Great convenience camera akin to a very mini SLR. This is no toy and takes excellent photos, which I use extensively in my blog.  The Leica lens and anti-shake are great. I also have a Nikon D70 but find the small size of the FZ7 means it gets carried more and thus more pictures. Also fast startup with no click delay. The video mode also comes in handy. Get a big memory card.|#|Some trade off between ultimate thin cameras and this, but I still prefer this immensely.

9.0|#|Features, Lens quality, Image stablising|#|None
9.0|#|Well priced, with a fantastic zoom. If you select the top quality which is 6 megapixels, you get 12x optical zoom and 4 x digital. I personally never need to use the digital zoom on the camera.(You can always zoom in, if you need to, using the software and your pc later) Here's the best bit.... If you reduce the selected quality to 4 megapixels you get 16x optical zoom !!! The other good point is the image stabilisation it gives you. If like me you havn't got a steady hand, its brilliant. Perfect shots every time.....and its fairly light and compact.|#|The flash is concealed and must be manually opened when needed. Was a pain at first, but i'm used to it now. A small price to pay for an excellent camera.

9.0|#|This really is an excellent camera.  The Cark Zeiss optics are superb, and I decided to go for not top of the range pixel depth in favour of better optics, and I haven't been disappointed.  I've used the camera for a few months for sports, holidays, work etc, and its a delight to use.  The 12X with optical stabiliser is a dream to use.|#|I was quite concerned about the feel of the plastics when I first got the unit.

8.0|#|For it's place in it's targeted market this little camera's a winner.  This camera is worth the money for the Leica lense alone.  I wasn't sure of it's abilities on arrival, which was prompt, but after completing a second term in Asia I can't put it down.  Great images, simply captured.  No need for an slr here.|#|A little on the plasticy side but the lens speakes for itself.  A great little camera.

10.0|#|MEGA Optical Image Stabilisation - prevents blurry images that happens with camera shake...some other brands don't have this.|#|There is no face-detection, but there is a multi-point Autofocus.Saying this, it's a good all-round camera.
9.0|#|Compact and lightweight, features work well and pictures are of good quality as you would expect from Panasonic|#|The LCD isn't the best i've used but i'm probably comparing to a much higher value product so still very usable
9.0|#|I took mine on safari and got some beautiful clear pictures even with the extra zoom on.|#|the extra zoom is a bit dificult to focus quickly, probably just needs practice.
10.0|#|Good bundled software|#|With the current low price of fkash memory, a 1GB card should be included (but now I'm being picky...)
9.0|#|I like the size and quality feel of the camera, its a good point and click camera but with features normally associated with more expensive cameras.|#|Doesn't come with a case and you have to be careful with the powerful flash as it can cause over exposure at short range.
8.0|#|Excellent pictures in natural daylight, fairly easy to use and good value for money.|#|Image noise is a massive problem except in good natural daylight. Image stabiliser of little to no benefit, pictures still as fuzzy as when image stabilisation turned off.

9.0|#|It seems to be so easy to use though i haven't checked out all the features yet.  It i small and can fit into a pocket and you can pull it out at any time for the quick unexpected photo.|#|Sometimes the flash makes the picture on the playback too bright.  that seems to be it at the moment. only used it for christmas parties and nativity plays!!
9.0|#|Camera is very compact and slips conveniently into a coat pocket. Spin wheel to switch modes is very good. There are a number of different modes by which can be used to take pictures to suit users of very abilities.|#|As with all compact cameras - red eye. Why don't manufactures provide a socket for an external flash? Being new to digital photography I found the shutter lag takes some getting used to, especially when you are trying to take pictures of your children going down a dry ski slope!
10.0|#|Very easy to use and OSI is very useful.  Can also force the flash off so picture quality is improved in some lights.  Great value for money - cheaper than our last camera and far superior!|#|None
8.0|#|Big screen with clear instructions.|#|No viewfinder.
9.0|#|Good and clear large screen that has a narrow angle function for when you want to do the classic compact digital camera move of waving it in the air to take a shot over peoples head. It allows you to clearly see the sceen while doing this. A good accompaniment to my full SLR kit when a quality point and shooter is more convenient.|#|I'd have liked a cradle/docking station for it while it's plugged into the PC. To charge the battery it first has to be removed and placed in a seperate charger, whereas a cradle should remove this need. Minor niggle though.
9.0|#|Very easy to use, i have taken over 1000 photos and 2 hours worth of video and the quality is excellent. Not a single blurred image. battery lasted  long enough for me to take 200 photos and 1 1/2 hours of video.|#|None that immediately spring to mind.
10.0|#|The picture quality is very good for the price of the camera. It doesn't rival proffessional SLR's but then it doesn't cost the same!  For what I was after, a reasonably priced, easy to use, point and click camera, with good quality pictures, it's perfect!|#|None

10.0|#|Excellent quality product, packed with features delivering superb pictures.  anyone interested in serious photography must consider this camera.|#|I have been unable to discover any significant weakness in its features.  Only one small item: wide angle facility is only 35mm (equivalent) it would be bettr if it went to 28mm, I have an add-on lens to give this but it is cumbersome to use.  The telephoto end is incredible.
10.0|#|Excellent camera. Easy to use. Menu system is clear and very quick and easy to change settings. Results so far are great.|#|No bad points to mention really. Photo quality issues regarding noise are yet to surface, so like I said, no bad points.
8.0|#|Overall capabilities; layout and operation.|#|None identified so far - early days yet!
9.0|#|manual zoom ring is great as well and the whole thing looks, feels and (very nearly!) acts just like a DSLR, without all the expensive, bulky lenses to lug around. The RAW image processing software that comes with the camera (Silkypix) is very good and very powerful, especially once you've fully aquatinted yourself with the mass of controls available. The video capture quality is pretty good and the output resolutions are pretty high compared to other digital cameras I've used. Also, the battery life is very good as well, although it never hurts to have a spare! The styling of the camera is nice and it's relatively light, so doesn't make your wrists ache after prolonged use.|#|The image quality, or more precisely the level of noise in images is disappointing. Overall, image quality is good, but for the money, I would of liked to see much less image noise and a greater range of usable ISO settings. Anything above ISO400 isn't really usable for anything much and even at ISO100 noise is present when the image is viewed at 100%, which makes a difference with large prints. In addition, the in-camera processing (not using RAW) tends to be a little on the aggressive side when dealing with the noise issues and consequently image detail can be lost and appear smudged compared to RAW (PC processed) output. This leaves the only option available to people wanting high detail and little-to-no noise, as having to shoot everything in RAW and then process the images on a PC, which uses masses of SD card space. This is OK to an extent, as it allows greater creativity and image manipulation after the shot is taken (through the great Silkypix software). However, on it's own Silkypix is often not enough to deal with the noise and almost always it is necessary to use third-party noise reduction software to end up with a clean image. Other than the noise issue though, which makes the camera poorer value for money (in my opinion), the camera has very few, if any other flaws.
9.0|#|Build quality, portablilty, Leica glass, Fantastic Zoom capability, Huge fuctionality while being very easy to use|#|Macro not even as good as my old Minolta Z6, there may be better options if you intend doing a lot of low light stuff
10.0|#|Picture quality superb, even when used by novice.  Superb mementos of Mexico trip.  Critical friends have commented very favourably on image quality.  One picture printed in Weekend Guardian magazine competition on February 24th.|#|Haven't found any of these yet.
9.0|#|Well built with a solid feel.  Looks great.  The focusing rings for manual focus and the zoom ring are convenient.  Picture quality is excellent.  Flexible operation, with ability to control settings  as well as being able to set up for point and click.  The pop up flash is powerful and battery life has been more than sufficient for several events without charging.  3-shot bracketing is useful, and I use this normally, which has saved many wildlife shots.|#|None really -especia;lly at this price.  I would recommend a filter to protect the lens.  The maximum zoom needs a tripod for stability to avoid blurring, but then we all know that.....

Battery life is good.|#|None
9.0|#|A nice camera for all pictures much better than the compact digital cameras. Worth paying the extra and slightly larger size. The 6x optical zom is good plus the optoion of a further 4x digital zoom gives you plenty of scope.|#|None so far I have come across

10.0|#|Easy to use, looks great.  Very clear and bright pictures.|#|Quite a lot of complicated functions to learn how to use but you can still use it very well before you know all the extra functions because of the Intellegent Auto function.

The video function works well, with a good picture quality.|#|3. The colours seem a little less vibrant than my last digital, though it is winter...
9.0|#|The intelligence mode works very well for most subjects. The macro mode can be adjusted to take off flash and set a higher mode 800asa and you can put it on black and white or sepia, it is good for taking pictures of print in low light. I have not tried out all the modes as yet, but read a review of the intelligence mode in the Royal Photograhic society magazine this week that rated it very well.  I caught some good shots of the cats in action with no time to set up a camera.|#|The manual takes a lot of reading and remembering, but you can always take it with you and follow it step by step. If in doubt take a picture on intelligent auto first and then experiment.

9.0|#|Easy to use with guaranteed good results.|#|none so far.
10.0|#|The wide-angle lens is a great advantage and the 10.1 megapixel definition is amazing.  The 5X zoom is also very useful.  It is no wonder that this camera is also marketed (with a different badge) as a Leica C LUX-3 at more than twice the price.  It is beautifully compact and, being smaller than a pack of cards, can be carried at all times.|#|None
9.0|#|I originally bought the DMC-TZ5 for myself and although it is slightly bigger and heavier than the FX37 I love using it and have found the wide angle lens superb for both indoor and landscape use. I bought the FX37 for my daughter as she wanted the even wider angle lens rather than the ten times zoom and the smaller lighter unit suits her 'point and take' approach to photography very well.|#|The controls are slightly on the tiny side for users with big hands, although they have obviously had to be scaled down to suit the very compact and streamlined design of the camera.

Love the slide show display through TV, just connect camera to tv choose the music setting and slide show of all pics - great for entertaining!|#|Zoom button on the top of camera can be a bit fiddly but ok once you master it. Have had a few blurry pics during moving shots (haven't found the sport mode yet and still getting to grips with all functions).
10.0|#|Excellent Point and Shoot camera.Ideal for the person who cannot be bothered reading all the technical detail to make their own adjustments. The ability to adjust is there though, if you want it. Small and light weight therefore easily fits in a pocket. Big clear screen and easy to use.

10.0|#|it is everything that we wanted from a camera, small, very easy to use, lots of ease of use features - auto focus and anti-shake, which allow the worst of photograhpiers to take a great picture, battery life is pretty good too. pictures can be viewed easily via television.|#|photos taken  at 12 mega pixels create hugh size files, as it is essenially a point and shoot camera, hugh files soon fill even a large capicity memory card.

10.0|#|Design, very sturdy and certainly weatherproof (tested in recent snow!). Picture quality excellent and HD video is also very good. Bundled software more than adequate for most purposes. Controls intuitive and menu system logical. Copes even in std shooting mode with contrasty situations, snow, shadow, colours etc really well. Macro good.|#|Screen can be difficult to see in bright/side light but this is problem with all rear LCD screens I have ever used. Start-up not quickest but adequate. Focus sometimes hunts. Rear control buttons can be a bit fiddly with gloved/cold fingers but show me a truly compact camera that isn't....

Panorama mode is well thought out and easy to use and fixes the settings to keep them the same across the panorama. Good image stabilisation. Feels well made and solid - like the waterproof dustproof shockproof and freeze proof features. Nice large display.|#|Easy to get finger in the way of the lens as close to the edge of the camera. Night flash pictures tend to be a bit harsh and cold. Dont like the zoom button operation which is a slider and is too close to the shutter button. Would prefer more optical zoom. Takes a little to long to power up ie you have to press and hold the power button for a little while before it powers up. Rather boxy looks. Cost of spare batteries. The idea of having to take the camera back to a dealer every year to have the seals replaced if you wish to use underwater.

10.0|#|images are great even on full auto, good flash, great colours and superb video for a compact camera. It's nice that when you set up a manual shot it keeps these settings in the camera after you switch instead of having to re-set them when you power up again.|#|
10.0|#|Using it underwater is the nuts so easy to use|#|None yet
8.0|#||#|Turn off anti shake when using the video mode. It ruin's the video smoothness. Great for normal photos but not video. else when off, video is great in HD.
9.0|#|Had an izoom feature that allows pictures to be taken with a higher zoom factor without loosing too much quality.|#|Would still recommend it though as a good looking, rugged and small camera.
10.0|#|Fantastic picture and video quality. Very easy to use, even underwater. HD video quality underwater is brilliant - we've only tested it in our pond, but it was like a David Attenborough documentary! Our dog has pulled it off the kitchen counter onto a tiled floor, but no damage at all - it's pretty tough! We're going to Costa Rica soon and can't wait to try it out when snorkelling, kayaking and in the jungle. The colour quality of the photos is intense, and at 14MP we will be able to blow up good shots to A2 size easily. Tha macro setting is great - you can get sharp photos at only 5cm away - great for shots of insects, fungus and other small subjects. We're really impressed.|#|The only bad point (which we knew before we purchased) is the zoom is only 4X optical, but that's to be expected with a compact.
10.0|#|Rugged, good looking, slim(ish), and easy to use (although my judgement may be coloured by the fact that I have had a panasonic before).  Like the one-touch movie button.  Very impressed - this is just what I wanted for my beach holiday coming up soon - no more worrying about splashes and getting a camera out of a supposedly waterproof bag. Also like the silicon case as that metallic body  (mine in orange) looks prone to easy scratching.  Overall very very pleased.|#|Must find a way of turning off the msg about chekcing the seals prior to use near water as it is driving me mad!  Also, and understandably the literature talks about replacing the seals once every couple of years to maintain the waterproofness - I wonder how many people do this and no mention as to the cost.  Kinda worth it though I guess.
8.0|#|Brilliant point and shoot capability. Good quality pictures.|#|No Mac software supplied. If you have a Mac it will come up as an additional drive.
9.0|#|Survived 2 weeks of Kitesurfing and Travelling around Brazil, being dropped on the beach, chucked in the swimming pool etc...|#|Slightly more expensive than others, but it was always the camera to hand when everyone else's had died.
8.0|#|Sensible depth rating brings it into amateur SCUBA use [not tried yet], tough, made to last, use of metal rather than plastic, use of SD cards is preferred option these days with competitive pricing. Colours not as good as my other lumix camera but the arrangement of the lens to ensure water tightness does limit the lens design. The selection of scene modes available is excellent from portrait to landscape, skiing to night shot and more.|#|Some form of lens guard would be useful, buttons should be bigger especially the shutter and zoom, on -off switch might be easier to use c gloves if better designed as could the selection dial- this model is promoted for outdoor/adventurous people and that is the reason I bought it- pity Panasonic didn't get some sensible user advice on the design before production. I have another Lumix camera - why can't the lithium batteries be compatible ?
9.0|#|buy this one and not ANY OLYMPUS ones they are just rubbish.|#|no panoramic setting and mmmmmmmmm nope thats it.
10.0|#|so far so good, Im still learning the camera, but very happy with it so far.|#|A veiw finder would help for some shots, otherwise ok
9.0|#|Easy to use and good battery life, not used it in water or on the beach yet though.|#|The moulded rubber case is a bit tight to fit and has to be removed to access the card and connector slots, so may stop using it, but it does stop the case getting scratched.
9.0|#|I like that this camera has so meny different features and it looks nice.|#|It would be nice if nordic languages were supported ( Finnish, Swedish,Norwegian...)
9.0|#|Excellent picture quality, both underwater and normal use.  Robust and easy to use|#|None
9.0|#|Nearly everything.|#|When using iA mode, the resolution options are very limited in 3:2 aspect ratio - 12.5M only, whereas in 4:3 you have more choice.  I can't see an obvious reason for this!
10.0|#|we used it when we were in Hawwaii and at wikiki beach|#|none as yet
10.0|#|easy to use, v quick start up, very good image quality|#|positioning of lens at corner means you have to be careful to keep your fingers clear. Battery/SD card flap a bit fiddly sometimes
9.0|#||#|Some of the symbols are somewhat bizarre.
9.0|#|Excellent camera for underwater shots when snorkelling. I found that I could actually see the screen, unlike my last camera which was very hard to see anything underwater if the sun was out. Scene settings were easy to use when swapping between beach and snow on the main dial to the underwater setting. I liked the silicone cover provided giving the camera that added bit of protection. Would definately recommend this camera|#|Being very picky here, but maybe a lense cover would have been good.
10.0|#|sturdy well built camera that takes amazing quality photos and videos - great for the adrenalin junkies out there who want to capture all those off the wall experiences|#|accessories could be better eg mountings for attaching to kayaks or surfboards would be very useful - come on panasonic keep up
8.0|#|ease of use.  minimum shutter lag and wake up time.  quality lens.  great build quality and ruggedness.|#|no RAW facility, battery life on the low side.  bought camera for winter mountaineering pics and beach shots but battery may struggle for few days without charge.  fairly easy to catch shutter button when zooming.
9.0|#|Very versatile, good pictures (not as good as TZ10 or a DSLR though). Decent battery life.|#|
10.0|#|Extra benefits are of course waterproofness, shockproofness and the thing, that I can take photos in -10degrees Celsius without any scare about the broken camera, it is very important thing in the country like Finland.|#|Only a little bad is lacking of a shutter of a lens.
9.0|#|Simple to use. Fast to start up. Good build quality. Good picture quality.|#|Only one battery supplied with camera
10.0|#||#|Sometimes you make a misstake with the zoom and the executive button, so you get a picture by misstake, but this picture can easily ben erased. Some presentation programs don´t sopport the HD lite format.
9.0|#|It's shockproof - I drop everything and this has been a big plus with this camera.  Also, it takes pictures very quickly and turns on/off quickly which is perfect for me as I am more interested in the happy snaps from the moment rather than perfectly staged photographs.|#|
9.0|#|Does what it says on the tin...|#|

Maybe the disply settings can be changed to show this?
8.0|#|very nice HD movies|#|price/picture quality but for shock and water proof protection is worth...

10.0|#|the indestructablness of the thing. can do anything with it!|#|
10.0|#|If you are considering getting a small digital camera in this price bracket then definitely go for the water proof Lumix, it is excellent fun and the action shots, underwater shots, surfing shots are just not possible with a normal camera!|#|I have heard that the video quality is greatly reduced by iMovie as well, but have nt had the chance to try it because I cant afford to buy iMovie 09 just for this!

8.0|#|For the money it costs, this camera is excellent as are all panasonic cameras (this is my third).|#|It doesn't have the most exciting features and they can be quite tricky to navigate towards. Once set on a feature it is quite an effort to change to a different setting. Older models had a switch on the top for this but with this camera you have to go through the digital menu. It also doesn't remove all red eye.

The results are really good with the 8x Zoom function which I think is worth paying a bit extra for.   As I gain more confidence I will be experimenting and trying to work things out myself instead of relying on Auto all the time.  My son, who takes amazing pictures with many different types of cameras, was really impressed with this compact digital aswell.  It is light and comforable to hold but well made.  Go for the black colour, so sophisticated!|#|Just wish the instruction booklet was a bit more informative!

Will recommend to anyone.|#|The front of the camera, that says Lumix, can show some (Non permanent)marks and finger prints when you hold the camera, not a big issue, but does make it look like you have very greasy hands
10.0|#|I took this little camera with me on a short break to Marrakesh without the instructions (on purpose, extra weight only had 10kg hand luggage). I did not need the instructions, it was very easy to use and work through the options. The zoom lens was great for taking free photos of the events in the Medina at night, if they see you taking photographs they try and get you to pay for them.|#|None

It is the perfect size to pop into a small handbag, is so easy to use and produces brilliant pictures.....even with me behind the lense!|#|Not really a bad point, but compared to my previous camera that was the size of a house brick, as this was one was so small and light, initially I was afriad that I would break or damage it.......however it now gets abused the same as my old one did!

9.0|#|Not had this camera long but so far am very impressed. It's speed from pressing the shutter to picture being taken is the quickest I've ever had. I already feel like I can wait for that perfect moment without trying to compensate for delay. As my first hybrid I'm struggling to find fault with it. It's real test will be when I take the kids on holiday for a week at the end of the month.|#|None so far.

9.0|#|sleek stylish easy to use with plenty of features|#|only bad point it didnt come with a free case to protect all its shinyness
7.0|#|Good quality pictures and easy to use.|#|Battery life is very poor.  We bought this camera to replace an old lumix and it needs recharging much more often which is annoying as we use it for the business.  The opening part to attach the lead to the computer to upload the pictures is poor and flimsy and more difficult to use compared to older models and Panasonic i feel should revert back to that design as i can see it is just a matter of time before this breaks.  Generally i prefer the older version to use for my business although the picture quality is better.

9.0|#|Good wide angle zoom is ideal for indoors and family gatherings and a more than adequate long zoom. An image stabiliser that actually works.  Intelligent mode setting allows any novice to get good images without understanding any of the wide range of facilities available.  Ability to change zoom setting while recording video.|#|No viewfinder which means that any older users need to wear specs.  No RAW mode to allow the best to be made of any images during processing.  No camera case provided.  Deleting single images needs several actions - double clicking the delete button to delete a single image would have been much more convenient.

This is my third Panasonic camera in nine years, all superb and still working like new, so I may be a bit biassed!|#|Would have liked a printed manual as, like all modern technology, there are so many features available and a manual on CD, good as this one is, isn't easy to use.
9.0|#|Easy to use and handle,has a quality feel about it,|#|none


10.0|#|It is a stylish nice little camera, easy to hold with excellent results.  The touch screen is impressive and easy to use providing you are using the stylus pen.  The menu is good and easy to use once you have got used to all the symbols.  It is an ideal camera for someone like me who is not a professional but do enjoy my photographs.|#|The only drawback for me was a lack of a fully operating manual.  You have to go on line for this and it could mean printing out about 200 pages although you could, like me, select the pages that you would modt likely use.

10.0|#|Excellent image quality - for a point and shoot camera it is superb. Very easy to use, purchased for my girlfriend who is useless with anything electrical, she can use it without even thinking. Has lots of extra options also for those who like to fiddle. 4x optical zoom in a nice small case, ideal size, compact while feeling well built and durable.|#|Build quality in places feels a little plasticy, zoom wheel for example. But considering the price range of this camera, this is really only nit picking.

But when taking pics in low light, then next time you use it in daylight, there is a lot more work to do - and it catches me out every time.

8.0|#|Outstanding value for money, takes quality pictures in a consistent manner|#|LCD screen not as big as some cameras and can be difficiult to see in bright daylight
8.0|#|Excellent high spec little camera from an excellent digital camera maker.|#|At it's current price you can't fault it for value for money.
9.0|#|Speed of recording images and image stabiliser. Easy to use menu etc.|#|
8.0|#|Picture quality for the price and a good range of controls|#|Battery life not the best - would advise the use of rechargeables
10.0|#|EASY TO USE|#|SOME THINGS ON THE MENU ARE A BIT COMPLICATED FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND CAMERA TECHNOLOGY
10.0|#|Good size for carrying with you at all times. Great little camera.|#|Not found any yet!
9.0|#|Good picture quality.  Optical Image Stabilizer works well giving sharp pictures.|#|No Optical View Finder, which you need in strong sunshine as the screen display is not viewable.
9.0|#|Ease of use, long optical zoom, good results|#|In very low light conditions, no light (infra red?) for the camera to auto focus on.
9.0|#|Smaller than expected. Fits comfortably in palm.|#|Lithium battery would be better
8.0|#|Small enough (for all but small shirt pockets), being big enough to hold comfortably.|#|
9.0|#|great optical zoom on such a bargain camera.  Images quality is great and multiple images options (sports, snow, fire works etc) work great.|#|No view finder, batteries go fast!
9.0|#|this is an excellent camera with high quality pictures so easy to use|#|model could be slimmer
6.0|#|Excellent zoom,fast start up,compact,reasonably good battery life and takes readily available aa type.|#|and focusing sometimes out. No viewfinder.
10.0|#|In good light the camera takes excellent pictures and the zoom is extraordinarily good.  Much to my surprise, by adjusting the exposure settings and switching 'off' the flash, the low light photographs are also excellent.|#|For the casual user, some of the more sophisticated controls seem a mystery - but, so far, not being able to master them has not prevented me from taking great pictures.
9.0|#|Some built in memory. Exceptional value. 6 x optical zoom :-)|#|Having to buy re-chargeable batteries and seperate charger. Built in MUCH more convenient. No case.

9.0|#|Compact, flexible and provides sharp quality pictures. Wicked and ideal for that sudden capture moment.|#|
9.0|#|night photography is amazing, its just great to have a good all round camera thats not fussy and works.|#|
9.0|#|Loads of good photo options, excellent LCD, a great neat little camera|#|Because there are so many some menus take a while to get to!
10.0|#||#|The video facility does not permit zooming once the recording has started. This was not mentioned in any of the review literature I read. It was because of this that I changed to a Canon.
9.0|#|Video quality is also excellent|#|Picture colours seem a little warmer than real life, but still a few scene modes to try out.
9.0|#|Overal, I'm thrilled with the camera. Use it in intelligent mode and it basically does most things for you.|#|Would be nice to have more control over the zoom lens...which are great... but a bit inprecise when zooming.
9.0|#|stylish with large lcd screen|#|none that i can think of
10.0|#|Very easy to use and the photo modes make taking excellent photos easy.|#|
10.0|#|I bought this model for myself last year and friends where so impressed with picture qualty from the wide angle lens I  purchased another for them. Battery lasts ages too and easily fits into my pocket.|#|None so far
9.0|#|LCD screen is good even in bright light that was one of the main reasons for changing my camera|#|Needs more thought and setting to get best results although the automatic setting is excellent
8.0|#|Lots of features you won't be bored with this one|#|Maybe no better in image terms than a lesser model with less features
10.0|#||#|Nothing bad at all
9.0|#|WVGA videos|#|camera case not included
8.0|#|Good motion pictures. Very easy to use though I do have a larger X12 panasonic so menu was similiar.|#|Very short AA battery life has put me off even with 2500mA/h Rechargeables.
9.0|#|Good Features all out door pictures came out fine. I used the soft touch for some of the portrates|#|Had a problem taking a distance photograph of my daughter graduation it came out dark. This could be due to the fact I was not used to the camera but when I bought it I thought it was just a point and shoot.


10.0|#|Fast connection speed to the PC for downloading.|#|Not really a bad point but there are alot of menus and options. This is one camera you will need to read the manual.
8.0|#|very easy to use, great pictures for cost|#|shorter than advertised battery life
9.0|#|Really easy to use particularly keen on the 'intelligent auto' feature.' Like the fact that it takes normal batteries.|#|None
9.0|#|Very easy to use in daylight and normal indoor use.  Some nice features, especially intelligent auto.  Picture quality generally very good.  Overall, extremely good for the price.|#|Time between shots seems quite long, but there is always the burst mode.

10.0|#|Very easy to use handy to carry around|#|Very small gripe- the on/off button a bit fiddly
7.0|#|very good|#|none
9.0|#||#|when creating movies cannot zoom in
8.0|#|Good selection of features which can be customised. With the 14-42X lens it is a pocketable camera and it has a viewfinder which is also essential for me.|#|The user manual is of the usual poor quality of Panasonic cameras. Most of the information is in it if you can find it. You need to persevere and work through it with the camera until you understand everthing you need. It is worth the effort.
9.0|#|Accurate and quick focus lock.|#|Battery life.
