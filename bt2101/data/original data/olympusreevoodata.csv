9.0|#|Great camera! Solid, well built and such a beautiful design. EVF is brilliant.  Great vari-angle monitor and a wealth of features. Highly configurable for personal preference and not too complex to get around the features. The body is a little small for my big hands but an ECG-2  or a HLD-8G or HLD-8 grip sort this issue. A joy to hold and use. With good lenses this camera is producing stunning results for me at a faction of the size and weight of my old Canon EOS bodies and EF lenses.|#|Battery-life is not great. The tracking AF is mediocre (although I'm coming from a Canon EOS 7D so my expectations in this department are high).  I can live with both of these issues, no problem.

10.0|#|I would have to say shooting video on a camera, I can use my lenses from my other Olympus camera with the converter ring. Tilt and turn touch screen.|#|Not had chance to use the camera properly yet, so nothing bad as yet.

10.0|#|Have used Olympus cameras since 1980's have always found them to be very good|#|No
10.0|#|Small discrete and very customisable.|#|Could be too small for larger hands.
8.0|#|Smaller and lighter than I imagined, which is a big plus for someone not looking to lug around a load of heavy gear.|#|Menu system was a little fiddly. Took me a while to find how to turn on RAW.
10.0|#|I have been waiting for Olympus to come up with a digital equivalent of my OM film cameras for some time. The E-M5 mkII fits the bill. The camera fits my hands like an OM-1, it is very easy to use, the front and rear dials in a basic mode provide the primary exposure adjustments. There are then a host of other options available. It's great1|#|
8.0|#|I liked the LCD screen which was articulated!|#|
10.0|#|So much lighter than my old slr, solid build and beautiful looking camera.|#|So far, need to get used to the electronic view finder and all the menu choices .
10.0|#|I was amazed at the quality of the images , the camera is nice and light and you don't get the heavy weight of a camera hanging round your neck like a Dslr|#|A couple of things to point out are the buttons to the side of the screen can be accidently pushed while taking a shot using the EVF, and noise begins to show at 400 iso
9.0|#|WiFi features are great to use whilst travelling to instantly edit and share your photos.|#|Not so much a bad point but it does take a little bit of time getting used to the size if you are migrating from a DSLR.  I went from a D2x to D300 to EM-10.
9.0|#|Haven't used it for long but so far love it for wandering round with. Much easier than lugging my Nikon D7000 around. Wouldn't give up my Nikon though|#|In camera menu's a bit daunting at first, but once used to it, straight forward
10.0|#|There are so many good points about this camera. The size , the features, the amazing ability to take night shots with great results due to it's advanced Mirrorless system.|#|Nothing yet.
8.0|#|Beautiful small marriage of hardware and software engineering. A superb small interchangeable lens camera with a viewfinder and excellent image quality.|#|expensive, but worth it.
10.0|#|I've only used this for about a week, and have so far found nothing that I have been disappointed with. The image quality is superb and if you are looking for something that you can use out of the box - this is it. I wanted excellent images combined with easy use - this camera for me sums it up.|#|
10.0|#|Quality of shots, and the ease of use (as someone who is making the step up from a single lens camera). It's also small enough to carry around easily. I love this camera, and would recommend it to anyone looking for quality at the right price.|#|I haven't found anything I don't like yet.
10.0|#|I deliberated over this and a DSLR as a step up from a point and shoot for months and finally went for this based on it being compact and my requirements mostly being street photography and travel. I don't regret my choice.  The camera is aesthetically beautiful, image quality is fantastic, and I'm enjoying learning how to use the different functions.|#|The menu and settings are vast. Though I'm slowly learning and figuring it out as I go
10.0|#|Easy to use. Very pleased   with image quality so far. Will have a better opinion after heavy use on forthcoming holiday.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|Easy and ligh to carry what is special great when you are travelling|#|Is not cheap... (But worth the price)
10.0|#|It have all The features of most DSLR cameras but in compact size.|#|Lenses quite expensive and their build quality could be a little bit better
9.0|#|And features|#|None
10.0|#|Small and relatively lightweight. Takes fantastic images, even with the kit lens|#|None
9.0|#|Easy to use. Compact and relatively light. Plenty of features allowing a budding photographer to develop their skills.|#|The screen doesn't swivel forward but otherwise no bad points.
10.0|#|Wonderful picture quality|#|Olympus batteries are very expensive; buy a copy for a spare.
10.0|#|For a camera with a small sensor (micro 4/3), the image quality is very good. Lenses for this system are tiny compared to full frame stuff. The Live Composite is a brilliant idea, and I can't wait to test it out fully. Built in image stabilisation, and sensor cleaning is something my current pro bodied D3 doesn't have and is nice.|#|After using Nikon pro bodies (D2x and D3) for years, the Olympus is tiny. I always loved the fact that when you pick up a large camera you know it is gonna take the knocks, and being weather/dust sealed they go on and on. The Em10 is not, so we'll see how it fairs over the years. But on a plus, I'm getting used to being able to take it everywhere with me all the time. Something you don't always do with the big Nikons!
9.0|#|Ease of use|#|The viewfinder rubber shroud came off and was lost
10.0|#|jpegs] now i just need to do raw and then convert, wifi them over to mobile and print on mini printer...brilliant|#|would like the weather sealing. also prefer custom buttons [ie custom 1 custom 2 ect] on the mode dial, rather than the current mysets, which i have to try and set up on the mode and then remember which myset is for which setting
9.0|#|easy to use|#|manual too big to print off
10.0|#|Finally the wifi has blown me away. I use it on both iPad and iPhone, so compatible, a good combo for holidays|#|Non reversible screen paranoid scratching it..
9.0|#|Superb build quality, image quality, wealth of options|#|Menu  / settings can be a bit overwhelming
9.0|#|Much smaller and lighter than a DSLR, but still easy to hold with large hands. The camera is easy to use and great in low light. I also find the tiltable LCD of high quality.|#|The menu system isn't as easy as my Fuji camera - although the touchscreen helps with that a bit.
9.0|#|Robust build.|#|Not intuitive to set up.  They should have spoken to Apple.
9.0|#|Purchased this camera at Christmas and have been unable to put it down ever since . The camera is fantastic really easy to use takes great pictures ,compact and very stylish overall a great peace of kit'that looks really good .plus great back up from olympus.|#|None
10.0|#|Absolutely love this little camera. Does everything a bigger SLR does, but in a small compact system. Everything you want if you're an amature or intermediate user, wanting something easy going and easy to carry around, this is it!|#|Nothing.
8.0|#|Excellent balance between size and imag quality|#|None
8.0|#|Live time and live bulb are amazing for light painting. That was the thing that swung it for me. Oh, and WiFi controls by android.|#|Impenetrable menus, fiddly buttons
9.0|#|After a Nikon camera the E-M10 is just such a great size! It has all the features (and more) of the Nikon, but without that big SLR feeling. The focusing is lightening fast  and the pictures even in low light are fantastic.|#|No real downside. Only thing I would point out is the Jesop version doesn't come with the pancake lense!
10.0|#|Good in low light situations (eg illuminated street scenes after dark)|#|None really, but because there's so much to this camera, getting the best out of it can be a steep learning curve. PDF manual (on the supplied disk) is good though.
10.0|#|Superb image quality and high iso performance. Excellent auto-focus performance even in very  dim light conditions. 9 frames a sec. that's fast, viewfinder very good and clear, works fine and very useful to operate in very light conditions. Stylish  retro design is a must and together with a sturdy and robust build quality makes this camera an exceptional device. Solid and a joy to use. Matches my canon 7D image quality, fact. Iso 1600, 3200, 6400 are excellent. This time Olympus really level up the game. I love my OM-D|#|
9.0|#|This camera is one damn good camera. I purchased to become my secondary camera; however, the way it handles it may become my first camera and my DSLR will become the secondary camera. I have used it on one pro job and it performed brilliantly; I was taking a real chance using it, as if it hadn't - then I would have upset my client and lost quite a bit of money and as a professional photographer, I don't want to do that.|#|I don't like the flash and think the other flashes are quite expensive compared to other brands. That said - they could be worth it.
10.0|#|light but a fully featured DSLR.|#|Only slight down side is that two of the buttons on the back are a little small, but I soon got used to them.
8.0|#|A worthy camera to carry the OM tag. Look, feels and performs as an OM should.|#|Complex menus can be difficult and slow to navigate. Autofocus can't deal with many landscape shooting situations.
9.0|#|It is a camera that can be adapted to most shooting styles. From the range of lenses, the range of features, to the use of shooting from the hip or through the viewfinder. It is a solid build for a small camera, and it does not feel 'delicate' in your hands like a 'fumbly' little compact. The picture quality is, for it's size, one of the best i've seen. It's obviously never gonna be up there with the dlsr in picture quality, but for it's size it is amazing, and with the build and shooting experience, i've gone for this over my dslr a few times.|#|The only thing that has recently annoyed me is the sensor for switching on the view finder, if shooting from the hip and you hold the camera too close, the screen will go off.
10.0|#|The camera is light, robust, and easy to use which combined with superb lenses and excellent image quality gives rise to a compelling piece of kit that you simply want to take with you everywhere.|#|The size of the 4/3rds sensor is often listed as a bad point. However this is completely outweighed by the benefits of the size of lenses (for the focal lengths).
10.0|#|Direct control of aperture and shutter speed via control wheels which are perfectly placed near shutter release.  Clear view of what you are doing in the viewfinder.  EVF a lot better than I expected.  Extremely fast autofocus for capturing images of my grandchildren.  Build quality feels just like a 1980's camera. Rear screen extremely sharp with a choice of live view or displaying camera settings if you are using the viewfinder.  Extremely compact design, not a lot bigger than my old Canon G7.|#|Very quit whirring type noise which comes from the cameras stabilisation mechanism, get used to it but its there.
10.0|#||#|-fan -like sound when camera on (can be only heard in quiet room though)
10.0|#|Kit lens has very good resolution|#|kit lens would benefit from being collapsable as it is quite long
9.0|#|Fast AF, weather sealing, light and well built, great image quality, very good performance up till 1600 iso. Great video shootings, with stereo sound. Very good range of several optics for MFT mount.|#|None so far, only the buttons are a little bit quirky though. And the usual, necessary comment: a wee too pricey.
9.0|#|Superb low light performance. Very compact and tough body.|#|A slight hum in use may distract but it doesnt come through on video shooting.
9.0|#|The camera is easy to use, has a really nice button layout, benefits from touch swively screen which makes getting the camera low for pictures a doddle. The camera oozes build quality yet is not that heavy.|#|It is obviously pretty expensive! Also I would not recommend the kit lens I found that it doesn't perform well in any situation unless there is plenty of light around. The rear screen looks like it could get scratched easily if walking around a fair bit, but nothing a £2 screen protector can't fix.
10.0|#|Professional camera about half the size of a DSLR. Takes amazing pictures!|#|Easy to get lost in menus, needs practice to master it.

8.0|#|love the camera need more practice with it but like it.|#|
10.0|#|Does exactly what it should.  Feels very solid and well made - it really does feel like a DSLR in a smaller size, but the quality seems to be better than an entry level DSLR.|#|Honestly, you have to decide.  You don't want to buy this if you don't know what you're doing, it's a serious bit of kit but good value if it's what you want.
7.0|#|very good light and colour images|#|lens too big (zoom 12-50 mmm from kit)

9.0|#|Good build quality, robust (except the flash mounting). Very handy, good volume and weight for transport. Easy to manage. Micro 4/e format also allows smaller objectives (less volume/weight), and smaller price for the equivalent objective|#|Not yet a wide offer of objectives, specially from independent manufacturers.

9.0|#|Image quality beats APS-C. Small size and light weight body. Mostly metal build. Water resistant. EVF. Touch screen. Twin dials. Water resistant, decent quality, versatile kit lens (24-100mm equivalent) with power zoom and dedicated macro.|#|Could have higher resolution LCD and EVF. Could have built-in WiFi. Could have a better hand grip.
10.0|#|Exceptional image quality, well weather sealed, compact, highly configurable functions, and with an £8 converter will take old manual Olympus lenses.|#|Not the most intuitive menu system; but you'll get used to it.  Features are so many, some you may never come across.
10.0|#|so easy to change settings quickly. The tilt screen is a really handy feature. View finder is brilliant. Recording movies are so smooth hand held. Auto focus is so quick.|#|It doesn't have the best grip.

10.0|#||#|None so far
8.0|#|Ideal lens selection would be the oly 12mm, 35 mm f1.8 , 45mm f1.8 and the Panasonic 50mm f1.4 . The 75 mm is one of tge best lens  but a bit expensiveat the mmoment.|#|Battery life could have been better but you hsve the option to buy the battery grip which is a must if you are come from Dslr .
8.0|#|Great size for carrying with you and can do anything you want it to virtually. I'm not an professional photographer, probably didn't need to spend what I did but happy I did.|#|Quite complicated to understand, loads of menus and options to get your head round. 12-50 mm lens needs a hood which you have to buy as an extra.
10.0|#|Very good all round quality camera|#|.Steep set up learning curve - not at all intuitive
10.0|#|It offers a good range of lenses too. The 45mm1.8 is a peach|#|None only some one looking for negative issues would find them
8.0|#|Once you have mastered the somewhat complicated menu system, this camera is pure joy.|#|Difficult to grip when taking portrait shots, probably should consider investing in the battery grip.
9.0|#|Great images easily with auto mode, and so much more to discover.  Menus and dials all customisable so you can truly have a camera that works the way you want.|#|It is expensive, but once you have it in your hands you will love it.
9.0|#|Very high quality, solid finish to the EM-5 - it feels like a camera that's built to last. Coupled with the extremely high image quality, in body image stabilisation and a great looking camera, what isn't there to like?|#|Tough to criticise, but would have been nice for olympus to make more of the touchscreen. Panorama is a little poor too, as requires PC to stitch photos together. Hopefully these will both be sorted in time through firmware updates.

Excellent Olympus build quality (as usual) Superb back up for a DSLR and great for those upgrading from compacts (Good Live Guide built in)|#|None
9.0|#|A big step up from my old camera, for the price, I really am pleased with this outfit. Still getting used to all the functions, can't wait to familiarise myself with and fully appreciate it's full potential.|#|Only 1 bad point.... for my wallet!!!! Keep spending/shopping for add-ons, (view finder, pancake lens, filters)    =0
8.0|#|Very compact and although the menu system does need a bit of learning but it does the job. The m43 format does give a large enough sensor for bokeh and good image quality but helps make the lenses a bit more compact than aps-c. Likeable little camera.|#|Screen is poor in bright sunlight. The lenses look a bit plasticky but I am sure will be robust enough in practice. Sparse on external controls but that is part of the design purpose for simplicity.
9.0|#|Assignable buttons makes the somewhat complicated menu system easier to negotiate.|#|The menu system is a little complicated for those more used to compact set ups.

Of course, the robustness is essential. I'm clumsy, and I get caught in the rain. Not that that is unusual. It's nice to know that the camera will dry out too.|#|My  Mju770SW (still in service) had a metal plate sliding across the lens when not in use.

8.0|#|I like that the programs are more easily accessible than older versions without having to plunge through levels of the menu.|#|The camera was however advertised as having WiFi capability, but with a specific memory card, and not the one that was advertised as part of the package.
8.0|#|options fun. Was bought for beach use instead of risking sand/water damage to other cameras . Great camera for family days out.|#|The zoom is a bit limiting but I accept that as it is a compact camera. The dials are fiddly for large fingers and not easy underwater .
9.0|#|Very robust (so far)|#|Zoom is not the best
10.0|#|Love the wireless connection and its features.|#|Takes some time to work out all the features.
10.0|#|I like the fact that you can fit an adaptor to mount a 40.5 mm UV filter (and other lenses / filters) which acts as an extra protection for the lens, something you cant do on most compacts|#|Front lens adaptor accessory seems quite flimsy.

10.0|#|Panorama stitching on the fly|#|Lack of silicone case that has to be bought separately/Lack of camera case that has to be bought separately.
8.0|#|The microscope setting is brilliant for getting very close up photos. I tried things like strawberries and one yellow pip filled the screen at max magnification. The ring light accessory is really needed to illuminate the object as the closeness of the camera blocks out the light|#|Easier to lose in the water. Invest in a good lanyard........and use it. I lost a  six month old TG-3 off my boat and had to bite the bullet and buy a TG-4. The Olympus floating lanyard is too bulky and expensive and you won't use it.

9.0|#|Wireless remote flash control|#|No cover on the lens


9.0|#|To me, this is an almost perfect compromise between portability, features and quality. It is (just) pocketable, the focal range is very useful, the level of manual control excellent and the quality of the images produced very, very good indeed for such a small camera with a small sensor. I think a lot of this is down to the excellent lens Olympus have chosen. Has it totally replaced my Canon 7D SLR? No, but it gets pretty close for most uses and unlike the 7D it is now always with me when I need it.|#|There's no doubt that it is pricey, but this is no ordinary compact camera. There are also one or two features I wish were available (wider exposure bracketing, selectable levels of Art Filters) but these may be addressed by future firmware updates.
9.0|#|Great all round little camera. F2.8 at all focal lengths is fantastic.  Tilty screen great for high or low aspect photography. 7fps is good but does buffer for a long time when shooting in RAW + jpg.|#|Semms very prone to noise on initial photos I've taken.
9.0|#|Viewfinder is superb.|#|Menus can be confusing at first.
8.0|#|I spent a long time researching cameras before deciding on this one - the main reasons I chose it were its balance of image quality/zoom and overall package size. Factors that I also liked were that it has the functionality similar to a dslr whilst also allowing automatic everything. That it was about half the price of the other cameras I was considering and that a multiplier can be added to it aided my decision.|#|Such a large array of functions time must be spent learning them all!
10.0|#|great 28-300 lens with constant f2.8|#|No printed handbook
9.0|#|The constant f2.8 is the major factor in my buying this camera.|#|Nothing at the moment..let's hope that continues.
9.0|#|Great picture quality for its price.  Aperture at 2.8 is fantastic in low light situations|#|
9.0|#|easy to experiment with the many features or just point and shoot|#|seems impossible to find a case that fits properly
8.0|#|The Stylus 1 is an excellent bridge camera which is ideally suited to travel and street photography. Lots to keep the creative amatuer interested, intuitive controls, has the build quality one would expect from Olympus. The 28- 300 F2.8 lens makes this a good option if you are fed up carrying lots of kit, but don't want to compromise picture quality.|#|
9.0|#|Takes awesome photos|#|The screen would benefit from more protection against knocks to the corners, a pouch or case is essential.
10.0|#|At least for me. I would buy it again.|#|None found as yet, I have not tried the flash and it is very tiny and on the camera so might give issues.

Live guide makes adjustments simple for less experienced snappers.|#|Menu is very badly organised to start with and difficult to navigate.  The standard set up of the camera is poor planned and confusing. However with a bit of patience most settings can be re-arranged to fit the individual user.

9.0|#|Really good picture quality, especially with the microscope mode, there are serious features for semi professionals but fun stuff for every body and its easy to use on land or water. It also looks great compared to some other rugged travel cameras. Cant wait to use it abroad and check out the accessories|#|Expensive although not compared to other cameras of this quality. Zoom function is not great for long distance. Alternate lenses are expensive, limited and difficult to find

9.0|#|Feels very good in the hand,top notch build quality,image and low light performance very good for a small sensor and enough features to satisfy anyone.Is system very good also.|#|Build quality means weight and the 12-40 adds bulk and weight so not the most portable combo.

10.0|#|modern design - we wanted a very good quality pocket-ish camera and I have to say takes good quality pictures - it makes the best of its 10 mega pixel engine and uses them brilliantly (given our brief we had earlier purchased a Panasonic DMC-TZ20 with 14 mega pixel and was simply so bad that we took it back to get a refund).|#|the lens cap is annoying (whilst it adds to the big camera feel) it simply is not required.
9.0|#|- excellent value for money|#|- lens protection lid not very practical
8.0|#|Build quality is very good. Overall I would recommend the XZ1 to any photographer with high standards.|#|It would benefit from an AE and AF lock button for more creative control at times
8.0|#|Very good low light lens, don't need to go above 400 ASA. produces very brilliant colours . Impressive build quality, RAW option, comes with Olympus viewer 2, which can handle raw. Quick focusing, also in dark|#|Smearing above 200  ASA, but you can use RAW, then you can go to 800 ASA. You need to learn to work with the camera to gert teh best results
8.0|#|Stunning build quality when compared with the competition, in black it looks understated and expensive. The auto focus usually gets the right subject and it's not too hard to force it to pick up on the right detail. This this is more crucial than usual as the quality zoom and fast lens combine with the larger than average sensor to allow for some decent depth of field control from a compact camera. You don't have to try too hard to take great shots.|#|Whilst the lens cap gives the camera an aura of semi pro-ness (if you'll forgive the word), it's a bit fiddly in reality. The control dial is easily changed - this is a real niggle as you can leave the camera in aperture priority mode, chuck it in your jeans pocket then take it out without realising it set itself to shutter priority mode, etc.
9.0|#|On the manual settings you have full control of aperture, shutter speed and focal point and on the art filter settings you have control of focal point.  All of these settings allow you to shoot in macro and super macro.  There is a large range of preset programs, so if you just want to point and shoot this camera covers every adventurality.  The colour and the resulting images are awesome particularly for a compact camera.  There are six art filters which gives the user more creative experimentation.  Art filter 6 called dramatic is particulally impressive as it changes dull overcast cloud into stormy moody clouds.|#|Limited zoom (X4), Short battery life (two and a half hours of continus shooting)
9.0|#|Really good image quality for a compact, and a good solid feel in use (It's a metal body). Can be as easy to use as you want with good auto and programme settings, but can very quickly become a real 'photographer's camera' with easy access to a wide range of settings. Contrary to some reviews you do NOT need to go into the menus to change these. There is also a number of Art Filters, which apply stylised treatment to your shots. No one will like them all, but I suspect everyone will fancy a couple of styles.|#|Not much to moan about. Shutter lag could be better. Compact users will find the lens cap a pain, but DSLR users won't even notice! The body size makes it good to handle but it has proved difficult to get a case to fit well.
9.0|#|. I'm an enthuasist, I was considering a micro4/3 but when I compared the image quality and performance, i was convinced of getting this little amazing camera. In future it's reasonable to consider the wide variety of lens adapters. There are for example a 0,25 fisheye-magnifier and a 1.7x tele converter for a cheap price. So I don't think the 28mm will be an issue.|#|A little too simplified. Firmware not up to date. Video mode a little dissapointing.
8.0|#|The F1.8 - 2.5 lens is he main reason I purchased this camera (upgrading from Canon S95) but even so I was still surprised at just how much difference this makes to shooitng options, especially at zoom end. I rarely need to go above 400 ISO, which is good because I have to say that I prefer the Canon S95 jpeg compression. The built in Neutral Density filter is good bonus. I did not expect to use the Art Filters or Scenes but the Dramtic Tone and Panorama are actually quite fun. The burst speed is great and another advantage over the S95.|#|In manual mode the screen adjusts to show approxiate exposure as a live view, but only within a 2 stop range (the S95 has no such range limit)

10.0|#|Grande facilité d'usage grâce à la bague qui entoure l'objectif une fois le programme de prise de vue sélectionné. Qualité impressionnante de l'objectif, rapidité de réaction. Les différents filtres artistiques intéressants.|#|Faible autonomie de la batterie, grosse consommation avec certains programmes (panoramique par exemple, mais celui-ci peu efficace sauf en paysage). Une seconde batterie et un chargeur annexes s'imposent. Bouchon d'objectif peu fiable.
9.0|#|This camera has an excellent, bright lense, which is why I bought it. It's also pretty compact - When I go mooching around a city, it's compact enough to want to take with me -DSLRs are relatively bulky. The images are excellent quality. Very good images at night.|#|Not the most compact compact - but then, the lense is large, as it is bright! So this is not really a criticism - can't have every thing in life!

10.0|#|Light to use fingertip control, very good lens ideal for flash photography.  movie mode excellant|#|not a good camera to use if you have large fingers
10.0|#||#|Problems are the lens cap you have to attach with the little lanyard otherwise it falls off every time you use it. The flash is not very strong, but then you don't need it most of the time, and it can't be used with the super macro function anyway.

10.0|#|Can change from auto to manual easily. All setting easy to change. Lightweight but feels sturdy.|#|Loophole on lens cover to take strap so you don't lose it but no strap provided.
9.0|#|It takes pictures quickly and easily, I took this camera on a trip to Europe and was able to get amazing photos from a moving bus at night, or could walk and get sharp images.|#|I never remember to use the flash.. Probably my fault, but it's a bit of extra effort to remember.
9.0|#|Good image quality, pretty fast autofocus, great lens, pretty good external controls, size, build quality, nice macro capability.|#|Access to some functions (ISO, autofocus-mode) should be more straightforward. More customization would be nice like different functions to the dials, noise reduction strength, AF area size.

The lenses are as good as any I have had before. Despite problems I got another before I had it repaired. I had always been a Canon man until now but the Olympus is so much cheaper and lighter with images just as sharp I am a convert.|#|The camera was initially quick to auto focus on indistinct subjects such as clouds and flying aircraft. After 18 months and 7000 photos this feature failed and it refuses to focus at all, constantly searching. On the rare times it manages to focus, the plane has gone. I bought another before having it repaired as I am lost without it.

9.0|#|This is an excellant camera! I have never used a Digital SLR before and with just a brief look through the booklet I was taking some amazing pictures. I would recommend it to anyone and at the price I bought it, it was a steal.

In this country it is a relief not to have to worry about it getting wet and as I live by the beach, not worrying about getting sand in the camera is also useful. I like the fact that it does not have a protruding lense. I like the colour too,|#|I would like a little bit more zoom but apart from that I can't think of any bad points.
10.0|#|while we were out)|#|The Lanyard strap broke after less than 1 week. This was underwater. For a camera designed to be used underwater this is very poor. We were lucky because at the time we were in fairly shallow water, but it could easily have been a disaster.

10.0|#|I have not used all the facilities on the camera... these aren't needed for my job, other surveyors have remarked on the quality of pictures I produce and the small handy size of the camera. I have to now so I am never without a robust little workhorse.|#|The length of time between taking shots... this can be so slow you cannot take a picture of fast cars or animals easily!!
8.0|#|I bought this camera specifically with a planned holiday to jamaica in mind. I wanted a robust camera that would be good to use whilst snorkelling and on excursions this camera fully met all if my demands and expectations. Whilst in Jamaica we did a lot of snorkelling and water activities and this camera performed wonderfully. We even took many pictures whilst walking up dunns river falls. An excellent all purpose camera.|#|
8.0|#|Has a quality feel to it and great built quality. Also for the price dont think you can get a much better camera which is shockproof and waterproof.|#|Image quality isnt brilliant and the buttons on the back are a little too close together so can make finding things in a rush quite difficult.

10.0|#|After my first Mju Tough 6010 was stolen I was only interested in replacing it with the same model as this is a fantastic camera.  I love to take photographs everywere I go but don't want to be too precious about dropping my camera or getting it wet - this camera can withstand being dropped and is functional underwater. Perfect for muddy festivals, skiiing, beach holidays etc.|#|
9.0|#|The camera is light, compact and easy to use. Images are really clear and the different modes provide some great options.|#|Only slight disappoinmets are the zoom feature - could be greater and the battery life - could be slightly longer. Overall very good camera at the price.

Higher price than most but you pay for the increased durability. The last camera we had didn't bounce too well with the lense fully extracted.|#|Quality of video could be better but Olympus don't sell this camera for that purpose.
9.0|#|Had an 8.1 mega pixel version and this is worth the extra money for the better image quality. Easy to use and lots of features that I am still trying out. Great for beach holidays, underwater shots and have taken it caving and hiking so good all rounder that performs in many situations but would love a bigger zoom.|#|Camera is steel blue not grey, I have only been able to get a 2 meg XD card and would prefer a bigger one

The best feature is that the long focus/zoom allows photography of wildlife creatures from a distance without scaring them away.  The auto focus works fine but it would have been advantageous, in some circumstances, to lock the focus|#|I would have given 10 out of 10 if this camera had had either manual focus or focus lock features. The latter would have made it perfect in every respect.  The autofocus causes resetting of focus mechanism everytime the shutter button is depressed.
10.0|#|I've used this camera while on holidays and because the zoom is so good I've being able to get amazing landscape pictures and pictures I was unable to capture with my previous cameras.  I've taken up close pictures of flowers and the detail and colour quality is excellent.  I cannot say enough good things about the Olympus 800 and would recommend it to anyone.|#|
9.0|#|options which can bring a completely different angle to your shots. The pop art and drawing one in particular impress me. The movie mode is also a great new addition. The microphone picks up voice and music very well. The image quality is second to none on the photos I have taken and I am looking forward to taking it on holiday with me as so far I've just been taking it out on test shoots. The playback fuctions are clear and easy to understand and the camera as a whole looks great and is easy to handle. It has a large LCD screen which clearly shows the mode/shooting categories that you are in for each shot. Post shot, it displays all of the shot information so you can pick and chose the best settings for future shots in the same conditions. I would recommend this camera to anyone who has an interest in photography.|#|DESPITE these three minor negative points, I would highly recommend this camera.
9.0|#|Good results|#|Viewfinder is poor in sunlight. When viewing phots that have been taken, the lens cover pops off as the lens comes out- not necessary to view photos
10.0|#|Loads of other features I need to get to grips with, but overall excellent VFM and a great deal. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to move on slightly from the straight forward point and press digtals.|#|Lost the lens cap coner on first day I guess that was my fault as I never attached it as I should have done due to my haste to use the camera.

6.0|#|It's a very good camara, well built , easy to use, good quality pictures|#|The lack of a view finder is a real drawback. It bright sunshine you can bearely see what you are photographing. it possible to take a picture of a bird in flight, for example
9.0|#|It has a simple scroll through mechanism which takes you to the different setting available one of which is a panoramic setting which is a very nice feature. The on screen menu is also an excellent idea.|#|It is hard to be critical of this product as yet due to the fact I have not personally had much time to use the camera itself and put it through its paces so to speak but I have to say that not having a viewfinder could be a bit of a problem in the long run as even in the most difficult situations it is possible to get an idea of what you are framing through a viewfinder whereas a screen notoriously can be difficult to see in certain conditions.

9.0|#|Have only tried it out once, to make sure it works. Think it`s let down by the zoom not working on video, which is a shame, but then I have a dedicated videocam to cover that. Simple enough to work and get to grips with.|#|No zoom facility on video which has already been covered.
7.0|#|The camera is well built with good features and excellent picture quality for happy snapping|#|You do not have enough personal control over the settings, focus on dusk photos is a problem, also the amount of time the picture preview shows is non changeable (at least I havnt managed to find the answer) therefore having to wait for it to clear before taking another picture by which time the subject if live has moved on!

Camera is really light and so easy to use, gives you examples of what certain modes you go on are for. Some great modes what you can choose from and you don't have to fuss about changing lenses ect as it's a bridge camera.|#|Only a few niggles with this camera, for one, some of the modes aren't so good for example pet mode, makes the image go very grainy which is a shame as the images on for example beauty come out absolutely faultless and another niggle is the recording. For some reason, alot of cameras these days do not zoom in and out whilst filming, this is one of them, which is a shame or it would be perfect. But i find this a very key point in any camera, you want to be able to zoom in and out of your subjects and if your subject comes closer you have to stop filming and change the zoom then record again. I'm sure the SP-600UZ did zoom in and out whist recording when i tried it in the shop but i cannot be sure for definite, i'd like to know why they haven't put this key element in.

Particularly liked the colour adjustment option, which meant we could take away some of the yellow tinge you get with indoor pictures. Interfaced easily with PC so pictures were simple to download.|#|When you switch it on the lens cap pings off so make sure you have it secured! No viewfinder means that on very bright days it can be difficult to see the screen.

The on/off button is easy to press by mistake as it is right on the top edge where you hold it - would have been better at the front or side, but you soon get used to it.  Makes a funny light clicking noise when switched on - finally found in the manual that this is normal as it is readjusting focus - but it is a bit disconcerting at first.

9.0|#|This Olympus VR320 camera has a good zoom (12.5x = to 300mm on a 35mm camera). It has an antishake function which works well, but on nearing full zoom I would recommend uusing a steady or tripod. SDHC Cards are available quite cheap and I recommend you get the fastest speed card you can afford. I'm using a Sandisk 45mb/sec class 10 card. I found the speed of the pictures taken was supprisingly quick. It fits in your pocket and is quick to start up. It takes resonable video at 720, but I have yet to play them back on a TV. It does not have an HDMI socket. The Auto Scene function is very good, leaving you to be able and point and shoot. It also has other modes that you can use as you gain experience. It has taken good pictures even in low light. I have had Olympus cameras before, but the menu on this camera is much easier to use than previous models I have had. Having a choice of colours is good. For a 12.5x camera st this price, that fits in your pocket, I would recommend it highly.|#|This camera does not have a seperate battery charger, the battery is charged in the camera, although seperate battery chargers are available. It is not Shower Proof. It can be a bit fiddly to hold, shame Olympus did not put a few rubber grip strips on it.
10.0|#|The zoom is excellent.|#|

Compact camera, looks neat and stylish, large screen excellent for viewing and I don't miss the manual view finder of my old camera asI thought I would.  Picture quality excellent and range of features just right, not too complicated however so do use different settings.|#|When using the zoom the position of your other fingers can mean you accidentally press other keys however this is a minor niggle and I'm conscious of it now so avoid doing so.

7.0|#|Nice and compact; with a large screen to view what you are photographing|#|Flash doesn't carry well, so a bit disappointed by indoor shots, which I particularly wanted.  Also, sound quality on the video mode is very poor.

10.0|#|absolutely brilliant. images are great, especially once uploaded onto computer or printed out. The 3d imaging takes some getting used to, but since I hardly use that feature it isn't a problem. The camera has a nice sturdy feel to it and is very easy to use! And, if your out and about and get stuck, it has a built in help menu which is very useful. The video on the camera is good in adequate lighting. overall I would highly recommend this camera, especially for its price.|#|video could be better in dark conditions but doesn't really affect me for what i use it for.
10.0|#|Excellent zoom facilities, easy to learn and use, excellent quality pictures, great for learning to take professional photos as has manual override and ability to return to normal settings.  Terrific flash facility in dark rooms.|#|Does blur a little as zoom closer, but that goes with most cameras.  Wish came with camera case as screen scratches easily - whatever you do make sure you get a case asap.
8.0|#|neat little camera with lots of features, cracking zoom although it wobbles madly on full zoom|#|sometimes its slow to take the picture and so you miss the shot, also flash isnt automatic but thats something to adapt to

9.0|#|Once you familarise yourself wit all the settings it is an easy cameras to use wiyh excellent picture quality for the price.|#|Ta.kes a little time to get used to the settings and it is easy to turn the camera on whilst in a pouch thus wasting the battery so a spare charged battery is a must

9.0|#|Easy to use, compact, flexible and small enough to take places, that you wouldn't a bigger camera. Zoom is great. To be honest its a good buy and i'm very pleased with it.|#|Can be a bit shakey at times when using high zoom - but providing your steady its ok.
9.0|#|It is very easy to use. It has great image.|#|Don't think it is ideal for the use in motion. It does not stabilise properly unless the photographer is very still.
9.0|#|Very easy to use in basic mode. Haven't had it long enough to be able to comment on more advanced modes as haven't yet had enough practice.|#|Find the software fairly complex and at times confusing eg I like to produce slide shows with text on some of the photos. According to my interpretation of 'Help' instructions, this should be possible but the text doesn't appear on the photo. Was very easy with software for my 8 year old, but low resolution Olympus. Have found it much easier to put photos into 'Paint' and enter text there. Hopefully with more time and practice I will get used to the software.
9.0|#|Great zoom, clear good quality photos, excellent macro shot, i love the panorama function.|#|Takes 3.5 hours to charge (longer than my last camera), battery doesnt last THAT long.

4.0|#|Nice compact size for spec's, good weight and beautifully designed - this is what drew me to it|#|focus lock can take an age, sometimes as long as 4 or 5 seconds. takes ages to save picture. these two points make it poor choice if you want to take lots of photos in quick succession, and even if you don't it is still a major inconvenience.
6.0|#|Easy to use. Has internal memory so can be used without memory card|#|Picture quality average. My cheaper sony camera had better quality.

6.0|#|its a very compact camera.|#|so at the moment in 4 weeks the camera has not been used to its full ability and we have no idea what functions it has or what its like, so on tht repect what we paid for the camera is quite over priced really, but it looks a lovely  camera.
8.0|#|Easy to use as straight forward camera and video immediately. Good quality photos and easy to transfer to computer.|#|Not great instruction manual, there is a lot of trial and error to find all operations but this could be a better way to learn.

10.0|#|Fantastic camera zoom feature to die for. Some of my first photos of the moon and zooming in after taking photo clearly shows the craters on the moon never believed this would be possible for a camera at this price. Also the camera is not too heavy but very strongly built. Thankyou olympus for inventing another winner.|#|No instruction book with camera only how to fit battery and charge it. Some of us prefer to read a book of instructions instead of the bother of downloading it all on a computer. Some of us elder statesmen prefer the old ways of learning about the use of something.
9.0|#|SMALL AND COMPACT FOR A BRIDGE CAMERA|#|DOES NOT COME WITH A CAMERA CASE
10.0|#|Great camera with point and click action, but the quality of a good SLR camera without all the fuss. Brilliant zoom and panoramic option.|#|Can sometimes take a few seconds to finish focus adjusting whilst zooming.
10.0|#|Great camera I love it! Takes lovely detailed pictures and the zoom is very impressive|#|
9.0|#|Great camera, and very good price! It's extremely easy to use and has many different features. The ultrazoom is definitely worth the extra money!!!|#|Doesn't have black and white feature.
10.0|#|I love my camera! I think it takes brilliant shots I am only a beginner but I think it's perfect and does everything I need it to.|#|Not great at warning you when it has a low battery but if you keep it charged it won't affect you. But the battery does last a long time though.

10.0|#|I bought mine after sourcing a digital camera for a friend and after seeing all it had to offer bought one myself. I would most definitely recommend this model to anyone. It's just great.|#|One small niggle. Buy an extra battery as all the features can eat up it's charge in a day or so.

9.0|#|Compact and easy to use. Sturdy - survived an accident. Good pictures.|#|The general problem with screen viewfinders is that is bright light it's impossible to see what you're photographing. I don't know if this camera is particularly bad but it was a problem.

9.0|#|An ideal camera for snapshotting while half-way up a mountain and the SLR is a bit too much to heave about. Easy to use, good battery life and acceptable image quality. The lens isn't as good as my SLR kit's ones, but you could buy several VG170's for the price of one of those. Not at all disappointed.|#|Not really found anything to complain about.

9.0|#|surprising number of features, really good quality lens, especially for the money. Its light and ideal to carry around when you don't want to take a big camera.|#|but that applies to virtually all small cameras

10.0|#|Have tested all features on the camera (apart from 3D) and been very pleased. The HD feature is very impressive value for money. Used the underwater mode for stills and movie with sound and  was amazed at the clarity of sound and pictures, you must check the seals on the battery compartment  afterwards though as some  water does sit in the seal, the manual does say this happens though, and it doesn't  touch the battery etc. Very easy to work out usage and all features are quick and easy to change between. Helpful in-camera manual and test feature and in-camera edit feature as with their SLRS. Overall very pleased.|#|The battery does seem to flatten quickly compared to other cameras i've had but  this may be because i was using  so many features each use.
8.0|#|It really does what it says on the label - i use mine for kayaking, its had drops/soakings and it still works!|#|But when you upload them you can really see stunning quality.

10.0|#|freezeproof camera.|#|not easy to press. I don't have a problem. Yes, u do need to press them firmer than a normal camera but this is because it is built to withstand shock. You wouldn't want the dials/buttons to break off if u dropped it.

9.0|#|Good image guality, waterproof,|#|Small zoom

8.0|#|10/10 for underwater pics! We have got some beautiful pictures and videos underwater. The panoramic mode takes getting used to but is very good when you have got used to it.|#|still getting to grips with different settings to get best shots inside and at night but that's no different to any new camera.

4.0|#|I haven't seen any that I can say|#|it's 14mp and the picture quality is so poor. Even when the flash is on at night the picture is so black. I don't like this camera at all!

7.0|#|Good photo quality not excellent. Have not tried the waterproof feature yet, but apparently it can go under water up to 3 meter depth.|#|Video isn't that good even though it says it records on HD, I have a phone that record HD video better...
8.0|#|Apparently it is water resistant but I'm not willing to test it out and hopefully it will be as rugged as claims.it|#|Not very good if your out of breath and your hands are a bit shakey. It's anti-wobble isn't as good as I would have liked it.

10.0|#|Lightweight, accurate, easy to use.|#|Why oh why, is the screen still unprotected? It is so easy to grip the item and damage the screen with your thumb - as I once did. And it took no pressure at all.
9.0|#|great photographs, easy to use but you do need to look at the manual for more complex options|#|sometimes can be tempermental, and won't take photographs when you want it to.
9.0|#|Light, adaptable, useful lens adjustment, easy to focus.|#|Didn't come with a memory card.
8.0|#|Good lightweight compact camera.  For me, its intended use is general photography as well as astronomical applications.|#|None, though it will take time for me to become proficient with all its facilities.
8.0|#|I think it is an excellent lightweight compliment to a more bulky SLR system, and an great upgrade to a compact, as it has a much larger sensor and therefore has better dynamic range and lower noise.|#|The viewfinder is small, it is not particularly fast, so unsuitable for sports photography. These limitations have to be weighed against the small size, the compromise might not be suitable choice for everyone.
9.0|#|Fantastic camera for the price it was sold at.|#|
10.0|#|Easy to handle - well thought out.  Very good performance and good to use in partnership with an earlier model|#|
10.0|#|compact and very light for a dslr|#|not found any
10.0|#|The camera has a host of easy to use features which make it able to be a fantastic point and shoot whilst having the capability of being a supreme champion of a photographers rubic cube - able to enhance the end result and also to channel its energies at creating diverse portfolios.|#|I just cant put it down, its taking over my life as I attempt to photograph anything that moves and many things that dont
9.0|#|Now very good value for money when compared to the 410|#|The camera do'es every thing I would want it to do
9.0|#|easy to use straight out of the box once battery was charged|#|olympus editing software caused problems with vista home premium  needed to download patch to correct fault
8.0|#|Very compact (for a DSLR); solid build; good quality lenses for price; customisable user interface to access the features needed most, more easily.|#|Built in flash is pretty weak
9.0|#|Easyto use good quality pictures very good zoom|#|
10.0|#|Just a great easy to use camera, image stabilisation is a bonus,excellent image quality...a real keeper|#|None so far
9.0|#|Excellant range of pre-set shooting modes for the novice. Good size and clarity of LCD screen. Light weight for a DSLR (dependant on lens) Battery life very good. Easy conection and data transfer. Good camera for entry level DSLR users and profesionals alike.|#|May have just bought camers body and seperate lens as the 14-42mm lens was not quite as versatile as I thought and I have bought another lens now with a wider range (18-180mm) which gives me more scope without carrying and changing different size lenses.
8.0|#|Image stabilisor in the body, so lenses do not need it, hence tend to be cheaper.|#|
9.0|#|The built in scene settings are some of the best I've seen on a DSLR and the controls and feedback during full manual shots are excellent.|#|A few body shortcuts to features such as the AEB would have been appreciated, but aside from minor quibbles such as this it is very difficult to fault this camera.
9.0|#|Very versatile with all the override facilities to allow experimentation but excellent in automode. Zoom facility allows to check focus when using non-auto OM lens with MF1 adaptor.|#|None so far
9.0|#|First class lens and image quality. Light-weight body is easy to carry. Programme modes make for easy exposure settings when in a hurry to get that perfect shot. The body feels well-made and the rubberised grips make it feel secure when held. All the dials and buttons are easy to use. Image stabilisation and a dust removal system acknowleged as the best available make for extra confidence when shooting.|#|Could do with more than the three auto-focus points. A protective cover for the LCD as per Nikon would have been nice. The USB Video out cover flap is flimsy and feels like it couild easily break.
8.0|#|grip really work for me.|#|choice of 4/3 lenses - but this is getting better and Olympus provide three quality ranges; worst point is relatively noisy images at high ISO - that's about it.
9.0|#|a light powerfull camera ,easy to use i've taken some really good pictures with it already has a decent battery life and i like it|#|

9.0|#|very lightweight easy to use|#|
10.0|#|The auto function is so good I don't want to turn it off!  The image stabiliser makes long range photos a doddle and the live view is great when you don't want to see all the action through a viewfinder.|#|I haven't found any bad points yet!
9.0|#|For the money this package is outstanding.  The quality is a clear notch up on my previous Fujifilm 9500.  I'm particularly pleased with the quality of images taken with the separate Olympus flash unit that I bought at the same time.|#|With all the features the menus take a bit of getting used to but with a bit of practise they're not really a problem.
9.0|#|once you get used to the way the menu works it is quite easy to use.  the more you know about photography the more you can get out of this camera!  Live view is really helpful|#|Sometimes the flash seems to take a while to go off after popping up, creating a lag effect when taking photos in low light.  Could be to do with automatic settings, which may be fixable with manual overrides. I am not an expert, so not sure how other cameras compare
9.0|#|Great Handling|#|Viewfinder information a little difficult to read.
8.0|#|Available features|#|Any DSLR is a complex piece of equipment, so it's a steep learning curve for the first time buyer and far more difficult than anticipated
9.0|#|great for use and easy plus scene mode is exellent if go travel for make photo realy good camera dslr|#|i not find yet
9.0|#|Impressive quality prints. The facility to take pictures in monochrome, tints. The DVD was good to help me to learn how to use my first digital SLR. Batter capacity is good. The lenses are easy to change and the lens cleaning mechanism is clever.|#|The function buttons take a while to find but okay once you know where they are. Would be good to have a memory card and camera bag supplied but these can be purchased reasonably on internet.
8.0|#|The quality of images/photos is excellent,  you do need to have the additional zoom lense for distant shots.|#|I think some of the features are over complicated and it is too easy to get into the wrong mode which can take time to sort out
9.0|#|Fully automatic point and shoot - if that is your style. On the other hand, you can use this mode until you get used to the many different ways you can set up the camera to take your own style of picture, be that aperture or shutter priority. Good depth of field and edge to edge definition.|#|Cannot fault the camera, but at this price, it would be nice if it came with an ECR case for protection, instead of no case at all.
9.0|#||#|Coming from a film SLR background I find the lack of manual focusing aides frustrating, also the shutter speed information in the view is very unclear - not a patch on my old OM2. E System is not as extensive os the OM System and the lenses are split into 3 group: Standard, Pro, and Top Pro. The image quality of the Standard lenses is prehaps not as good as I was expecting, but maybe I'm just getting old.
10.0|#|Very easy to use. Included a training DVD. That helps me a lot.  Excellent emage quality. For a learner or a beginner it is superb.|#|Accesorries like flash guns and lenses are too expensive. (Same as other DSLR). Should be included an extra lense as well.
6.0|#|Good value and well made. Potentially excellent picture quality.|#|Doesn't focus properly! Tends to focus too close (particularly with wide angle zoom lens) and objects near infinity are often out of focus.
9.0|#|Upgraded from e500. Image stabiliser is great, picture quality as good as anyin its class|#|
10.0|#|Loads of features, excellent image quality. Camera has a good feel to it.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|good pictures and features|#|master editing very poor
10.0|#|Easy to use, the extremly clear viewing screen, easy to use menu, build quality and feel are great.|#|The only thing I would fault is the position of some of the buttons, as I some times press them due to my large thumb, but otherwise it is as near perfect as possible.
10.0|#|Has to be the price - all these features and two lenses has to be good. However for a newbie to DSLR like me, the manual is pretty easy to read and lots of tips to be found in books and the internet all helped me shoot impressive pictures pretty quickly|#|None that I've found and none that aren't about me being anamateur (i.e. finding my way around all the buttons and gadgets assocaiated with a camera sch as this).
10.0|#|1st class image quality, solid build, versatile and at a great price|#|Menus take a while to get used to.
10.0|#|precision made camera|#|case not included
8.0|#|good package|#|
8.0|#|As this is my first Digital SLR I canonly compare it with my pre purchase expectations of what I wanted from a camera from Olympus. Having previously owned a 35mm camera and compact from them I knew that the build quality would be good and so far I have no complaints on any aspect of the camera: it's ease of use or the quality of the images.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|More features than equivalent,top equipment|#|small viewfinder
8.0|#|c) is good for those of us with large hands. Olympus 4/3 system means the two lenses give great flexibility|#|Metering information in viewfinder is difficult to see when used in vertical format
9.0|#|Minimal shutter delay.|#|Can't think of any.
10.0|#|Easy to use, feels good quality, menu easily navigable, good colour repoduction.|#|In auto program the flash has a habit of engaging when you don't expect it to, but this is probably down to my lack of experiance in using the camera. Otherwise no problems at all.
9.0|#|Great price|#|
9.0|#|easy to use, superb lenses, not too heavy, excellent images, can use CF cards as well as xD cards, plenty of manually adjustable features but also with great fully auto mode, well laid out buttons, great battery life (easily 300+ shots per charge), charger comes with EU plug as well as UK.|#|none really, minor niggle such as lens cap does not come with cord connection to camera/lens so keeps dropping, but can't think of anything else.
10.0|#|Good image quality for a very cheap purchase price.   A feature packed product which suits my needs very well.|#|The usual 4/3 problem with viewfinder size and clarity but it  is really not a great problem for me even with spectacles
10.0|#|Manageable weight, stylish and sturdy build. Excellent value for money.|#|All those buttons! As a returner to the photography hobby, there is a lot to get to grips with, but every button has a useful function.
9.0|#|very compact dslr with loads of features, easy of use, absolute worth of money.|#|the manual is quite difficult to understand with few details on some part.
9.0|#|Good performance and comprehensive facilities. Good price at time of buying.|#|None found yet.
9.0|#|Haven't had time yet to study and master properly instructions and therefore camera's facilities.  Seems a well equipped and sophisticated machine for the money.  What is immediately attractive is the low weight and ergonomic design.|#|None discernible
9.0|#|Very good value for money digitalSRL, with image stablizer and dust reduction.  As an inexperienced photographer too early to say much more.|#|best buy but as a starter package looks OK at the moment.
8.0|#|All in all,I am very pleased I upgraded to a proper camera.|#|to experiment with,I will get there eventually!!!.
8.0|#|I chose the 510 mainly because I like olympus and the live view.|#|I found it very complicated so far but after many evenings practicing ,it is getting a bit easier to use  .............. there are so many functions to learn about .

9.0|#|Image stabilisation is fantastic; rarely fooled by difficult lighting conditions; compact; quiet; menu is quick to grasp and most important functions are accessed by command buttons. Dust removal system so far has worked faultlessly.|#|3 autofocus points is a little bit limiting and the button for switching between these points is sometimes fiddly to use
9.0|#|Easy to get started with|#|So many features to get use to
7.0|#|From my limited experience, I think it focuses quickly and accurately and sits nicely in the hand.|#|Perhaps a little bigger than I would have liked but this is the choice I made when I went to digital SLR. I think some of the minor function buttons are a little footery and possibly ,for me, the camera does too much
9.0|#|Great camera, good quality, very good price with bundle|#|
9.0|#|Good handling, easy controls, fast shooting.  Dual cards is fantastic.  Wife learned to use it very quickly, and prefers it to compact.  Lenses small and protable.|#|Best to avoid full auto mode if you want to control want you are doing and not let the computer take the easy opition.

8.0|#|The camera was very cheap and a brand we like. It is light and easy to use. It takes quite good photos. The distant shots are better than our last camera.|#|Can sometimes take a while to take photos with flash. It doesn't have a lot of features such as landscape, winter, behind glass etc. However, for taking quick pics it is worth the money we paid. :-)

4.0|#|It is aesthetically pleasing and very light, along with being relatively easy to use|#|Awful image quality and tacky build, felt like it could break easily and definitely wasn't worth the money
9.0|#|I have bought this camera for two separate people and i think for the neatness of size and the ease of use it is ideal for a day to day camera. It is fairly intuitive and certainly small enough to put in a handbag or pocket just in case there is something worth capturing!|#|Limited zoom but for the price of it i don't think you can expect that much more.
9.0|#|takes great photos|#|a bit slow on the uptake
10.0|#|It was very easy to use and it is a very nice colour! It had an editing system which was great and it had a number of settings including macro mode which is useful. It takes great pictures and the zoom is great. It can also take films which is good.|#|Overall it was a very good camera but there wasn't any playback volume for the videos which was a shame.

9.0|#|this camera is slim, sleak and stylish.  Bought this for my mom at xmas who isnt very tech savvy so features needed to be easy to use.  With this camera they are.  The menu is very intuitive and the buttons on the back of the camera speak for themselves.  The Screen on the back is perfect and clear.  Also has a lithium ion battery so no more pesky aa or aaa's.  Battery is taken out of cam to be charged in the battery doc which i like as its safer.|#|Honestly, my mom has been using it for a month now and loves it.  Maybe the only downside is itdoesnt come with a camera case.

Would have been better if the operator could easily change exposure times with an external button. For the same price a compact digital SLR would give more professional results with much more user control over the image to be captured. In short it is no better than similar cameras for half the price.
9.0|#|Fantastic zoom, got it for a great price from SE. A really good camera, packed with features, brilliant for taking quick opportunity of sudden photography moments... No massive equipment to lug about. But still does beautiful pics!|#|I don't know... it depends what you're using it for. If it's for big professional shots for some magazine or another, perhaps not. But for really good 'amateur' photography, I think it's top.

8.0|#|Compact and easy to carry around.  Gives v.good  image quality for size of camera.  The automatic enlargement of small area of image when using manual focus is excellent.  Built in level a real step forward in usefulness. Good Jpegs straight out of camera. Good noise performance compared with other compacts. Good build quality.|#|Expensive.

9.0|#|Great Camera - build quality is outstanding. Optics perfect.|#|Expensive, no flash.
8.0|#|Good looks and excellent build quality|#|Monitor could be better in bright light so a built in viewfinder would be good
10.0|#|The Olympus PEN e-p1 packs in the option of SLR *AND* 'point-and-shoot' functionality with lots of 'extras' into a very compact very nice 'retro' design. Image quality is brilliant. For the nicer look, go for the silver rather than the black 14-42mm lens and don't bother buying the fixed pancake lens (available as an accessory) which has no zoom range (so totally pointless). If you buy any additional four thirds zoom lenses, don't forget you'll also need to buy the MMF-1 adapter as this camera is built to take 'micro'- four thirds lens, therefore *not* the same size as standard 'four-thirds'. Battery will last for two days of moderate usage, so I would recommend buying a spare battery. Also, the brown leather body-case and strap and soft brown leather retro bags (in three sizes) are all very nice - if pricey - accessories in keeping with the camera's classic design. The flash is only necessary if you anticipate taking photos in *very* low light conditions. Otherwise, you can compensate for low light by adjusting the shutter speed. I highly recommend this camera!|#|Only down-side is lack of view-finder. However, it's no great loss if you prefer to use the screen anyway. The only place where you might miss it is very bright conditions. However, as long as you have reasonable eye-sight, you can still see the image even in bright sun-light. The view-finder which you can buy for it is a little pointless as you can only view a single fixed frame - a bit like like the old automatic camera view-finders.
8.0|#|Great Retro look|#|Not brilliant at high ISO unless you have fast lenses
9.0|#|I researched it thoroughly before buying, and there are (generally) some issues that have appeared in the reviews that need addressing. 1) lack of flash, 2) poor/slow focus and 3) a low quality screen that is difficult to see in bright light (hence the viewfinder on the EP2). 1) The lack of flash isn't an issue for the more advanced photographer, they are largely unnecessary, but a lack of a fast lens (see below) is an issue. 2) This has been greatly improved by firmware updates, but it still has issues in some low light situations. 3) not an issue at all. I have tried looking at it from all angles in bright sunlight - the image is still perfectly usable! Finally at half the price of the original RRP (and the EP2), this is the bargain of the year|#|The final point (which is not really a negative) is about the camera as a DSLR replacement. It is certainly not that. As a general camera, it is brilliant, but for the more challenging images a DSLR will still be the camera of choice. Remember, it is not a compact, it is not a DSLR. It is a PEN.

10.0|#|Build and image quality excellent|#|Need to buy 'extras' to get full capability (flash/viewfinder) but treat it as a very upmarket compact and you'll be very happy.
9.0|#|Fantastic build. Great image quality, both on Auto settings, and manual. And just the best looking camera on the market, which makes you want to pick it up and use it. Lovely.|#|Nothing springs to mind.
8.0|#|Good pictures quality and good pictures results especially dimmed lights indoors without a flash. Lots of features such as art styles, candles, night, portraits and etc. RAW is available for professional photographers who can edit them via Photoshop or Olympus Master software which includes in the camera package.|#|Too many settings which can be frustrating and slight confusing. It takes a while to learn them all and get used to them. Still learning.
10.0|#|Image quality is excellent, low-light performance is the best I've ever seen, it handles well and looks amazing, the burst mode is incredibly fast|#|The continuous autofocus mode is poor
9.0|#|This is a fabulous camera! If like me you're sick of carrying a heavy SLR and lenses you couldn't do better, not exactly pocket but small enough to carry in the trendy leather shoulder bag and hardly notice it's there. Amazing image quality, much better than my aging Canon EOS 350D, even at high ISO. The lack of a flash doesn't bother me but some might miss it.|#|Hardly any, the kit lens is good but naturally limited, and the lack of an affordable and compact zoom lens is a miss, and some might want a built in flash
9.0|#|its a good camera, small, light but powerful. Also it is capable of taking pictures in very low light conditions and you can get a range of lenses for it.|#|Would have been a useful to have a flash and a viewfinder, but these accessories are quite expensive and most users do without them
9.0|#|Easy to use, lightweight, accessories available, excellent picture quality, multiple modes|#|Accessories can be expensive (rrp for flash £149)
9.0|#|The camera feels sturdy and the image quality is surprisingly good for such a compact camera. The auto metering system deals with most situations. I tried a few night shots over Brixham harbour, setting the aperture to F8 and using the timer to enable a steady shot. The pics were perfectly exposed.|#|The EP1 doesn't have a built in flash, but as I purchased the camera for travel, this doesn't matter. In fact, as the model has been superseded,  it's a great buy.
9.0|#|The filters are fab, as is the camera's retro shape and design.  It is small and easy to carry, and the photo quality is great.|#|The fact that you have to buy this piece by piece (eg flash, viewfinder are add-ons and not included in standard package.)
9.0|#||#|I haven't found any yet.
7.0|#||#|No flash with camera. Separate purchase of flash is a rip off.
10.0|#|I thought  this kit represented excellent value based on the reviews I read -  it was also becoming hard to find the camera anyway as a newer and much more expensive replacement was on the market. I am delighted with the camera because it is so well made and produces some excellent pictures. I bought the two lens kit and would recommend this as it provides a lot of flexibility and additional interest.|#|None as yet
10.0|#|Great to hold and use. Excellent images and firmware can easily be updated (which seems to fix any problems mentioned in the early reviews). It would be less conspicuous than a DSLR if it wasn't so stylish!|#|I hate putting the loose lens cap in my pocket. Optional flash is comparativley expensive and doesnt swivel.
10.0|#|camera I am delighted to say that this is it. All the main controls are easily operated by traditional twisty knobs and rings and not fiddly little buttons. I am aware that some reviews criticise this camera as being over-engineered, to be honest it was this comment that prompted me to purchase one. I was not disapointed. Initial use of the camera prove the results obtainable to be excellent.|#|The build quality of the 14-42 mm lens is quite up to the same standard as the camera body.

Excellent build quality.Very versatile once you master the menu system. .Lovable  (very subjective I know!)|#|Screen difficult to see in direct sunlight. No built in flash although I picked up an Olympus  FL-20 online cheaply which gives excellent results and is tiny for an external flash.  Zoom kit lens fiddly and not that sharp (my copy at least). Menu system takes a bit of getting used to.

9.0|#|better than the new epl-1|#|
8.0|#|Excellent build quality and very good image quality. A great alternative to a DSLR, albeit without a vast range of lenses|#|You get used to lack of viewfinder - which is a bit of a pain to begin with. Really don't want all of the silly compact camera features such as scene selection, art filters etc.
10.0|#|The nearest you can get to a good dslr without the weight. It only falls behind at iso 400/800 (compared to a Canon 5d). Possibly the best travel camera you can get, along with the other m4/3 cameras. The camera is almost jewel like and exudes a semi vintage style. The af is fast enough and the kit lens is good quality. Its the most enjoyable camera to use since I had a Leica M5|#|lack of an eye level finder can be a bit of a hinderance in very strong sunlight. though you can get one for the 17mm lens.
10.0|#|There are great range of accessories available for this system if you look around and I have found one where I can use the lenses from my film cameras on the E-P1 which has opened up my options tremendously.|#|Some small ergonomic issues with button positions, but i will get used to this.

Cannot hear sound through the camera when playing back a video, you need to plug into tv/computer to hear sound.  Not a speedy point and shoot.
6.0|#|Good clear picture quality when taking photos during the day, easy to use and very compact.|#|Disappointed with the image quality when taking shots at night even using the night scene selection.  Photos were very blurry.  Also disappointed in the time it takes to take the shot, it is a good few seconds between you pressing the button and the shot being taken, not good when you are trying to take photos of a 2 year old who doesn't sit still.  A few of the features on my previous olympus have been removed also.
8.0|#|Easy to use|#|Like most of this type of camera it has no viewfinder, only the back screen which is difficult in very bright conditions.

2.0|#|compact and a fairly big screen.|#|Picture quality Very erratic, but never crystal clear - slightly blurred at best appaling at worse - especially with the flash. The flash is in the wrong side and fingers often cover it when pushing the shutter. Video playback on the camera has no sound. Absolutely awful! Love taking pictures but this camera has put me off. If i could return and replace with a better camera i would jump at the chance - even if i had to pay a bit more!
4.0|#|Nice looking, easy to use.|#|The flash/automatic ligh balancing is way off; any indoor/night point and shoot  activity will result in a poor picture. Unless you get two goes to work out which setting is going to work you are going to be dissapointed. I even resort to wrapping the flash light in tissues;hankies to tone down the harshness the deafults.

She has tried every setting combination possible and still the camera has not produced one quality picture. Consequently the camera remains untouched and back in its box. I tried to return the camera to Tesco, who were very unhelpful and said it was not thier responsibilty and gave me a helpline number for Olympus. No answer, office hours and a complete waste of time.

8.0|#|Camera, lenses, price|#|The case.  It is a very good case, but not  for this camera/lens combination; I haven't been able to find a way to get everything in the case except with the tele lens attached to the body.
9.0|#|Good value for money|#|None in particular
10.0|#||#|the live view is great most of the time, but the lack of view finder is sometimes missed
9.0|#|Most of the benefits of an SLR in a more compact package. Can be used daily as a point and shoot compact digital with a pancake 17mm lens (separate purchase ) , and as an SLR replacement with the zoom lenses. This version adds a built in flash capability not on previous EP series cameras. Stylish design and solid build quality.|#|Lenses are a bit scarce.
9.0|#|is easy to use to alter settings and this in turn leads you to experiment further with the other options. The camera has a nice solid feel to it and although compact it is not too small for man sized hands and fingers. At the current price it is excellent value.|#|Cannot fit your pocket when the lens is on. The 40-150mm lens extends a long way when in use and looks a bit silly on such a compact camera. I imagine that a wide angle pancake lens would be more to scale, be more pocketable and be more versatile.
9.0|#|Very impressive|#|Lack ov view finder and non tilt LCD screen
9.0|#|Very easy to use in Auto mode, just point and take.  But also excellent if you want to be more adventurous and creative in manual mode.  Much lighter than DSLR but with comparable image quality and flexibility.|#|Lots of button pushing when using manual modes, I dislike using the LCD screen so purchased the EV2 electronic viewfinder (a bit pricey but well worth the investment).
8.0|#|lt's light weight.|#|I still need to practice to find out what I like and dislike about it.
9.0|#|I can shoot good photos simply on Auto setting... I'm so busy, this is a real bonus!|#|

9.0|#|Amazing price performance|#|not the fastest auto focus
10.0|#||#|Menus not as slick as other cameras I have used
10.0|#|Superb image quality, and a quality feel to the camera. I wanted as close as I could get to DSLR quality without the bulk of carrying a massive great camera around with me, and this kit seems to deliver. Purchasing another couple of prime lenses to compliment to two zooms that I got with the kit and a VF-2 viewfinder will be another purchase at sometime in the future. Overall, very very happy with my purchase.|#|very useful and this has helped. Low light focusing can be a little hit and miss, and I wouldn't recommend this camera if you are going to take action shots as it hunts a little bit, but most of my photography is done in good lighting and I'm not into action pics so it suits my purposes.
10.0|#|Sharp pictures.  Both lenses give excellent photo coverage and the range they reach is great.|#|
9.0|#|Olympus have not spared any expense when it came to picture qualitty. Also good value for money and coat pocket size.|#|The build quality overall is good but the cheap plasticy buttons does not suite a prime camera.
9.0|#|Exceptionally easy to use at different levels of complexity and user control. Superb final pictures. Easy lens change and very good lens system.|#|It is too easy to turn on the video by mistake.
9.0|#|Interchangeable lenses, a wide variety of shooting modes, a reasonably high pixel count and a fast response time make it an ideal camera for this purpose.|#|The medium retro bag is a snug fit, to say the least!
10.0|#|I havnt had the camera too long and I'm still getting used to it but I'm very pleased with the results, very clear lens reproduction.|#|Not come across any bad points yet.
9.0|#||#|Would have preferred the 14-150 lens instead of two separate lenses but is is too expensive.
9.0|#|Great pictures as push of button - the software is excellent with great display and editing options including an airbrushing function and tagging for faces and places.|#|Can take a while to navigate menus for the right function.  Just need more experience with it
9.0|#|Value for money compared to other similar products low, but  the big impressive overiding tick no doubt about it is the image quality the image quality is fantastic!!|#|i hate having to pay for extras that should be included with a camera at this price, considering very similar models around at this time
8.0|#|but with nothing in the price range to get near it and good all-rounder if the tough features aren't a necessity.|#|As many have pointed out the battery is relatively shortlived and it doesn't have an external charger supplied. However as some have noted battery life is more acceptable after it has been fully discharged and charged several times. Controls can be a little fiddly and are likely to be a problem if used at the extremes of it's capabilities during water or winter sports !
10.0|#|takes very good underwater photos|#|have not found any yet
9.0|#|robust, managaged to drop it almost immediately with no adverse effects! Good features and easy to use.|#|None as yet
9.0|#|very good build does what it says on the tin, its a waterproof tough camera, i'm an outdoor instructor so ideal for me.  Plenty of features so can take some time to get used to and work out how they all work but better to have the features than not in my eyes.|#|because there is no sticky out lens or zoom you can forget its on which drains the battery i have all the power save setting on now so that may help. great camers though
8.0|#|Good fun for taking shots under water.|#|Not the easiest to use when snorkelling as the controls are quite close together so require a bit of dexterity which isn't easy under water
9.0|#|Easy to use - my 6 yr old can use it!|#|None really - works as advertised.
8.0|#|It takes AMAZING underwater pictures. It's small and compact. It's also very easy to download the pics onto the computer.|#|it's a good 3 seconds before the picture takes, so sometimes you miss the moments. The buttons are quite hard to press sometimes. Also sometimes the flash is too bright and pictures are over exposed.
9.0|#|It is so durable|#|Would like to have zoom for video
8.0|#|The Olympus mju is an excellent overall camera. I purchased this for my daughter and the underwater pictures and also HD video footage she took was amazing. The pictures taken generally where of very good quality. It is easy to use and my 13year old had no difficulty picking up how to use this camera. When we uploaded the pictures onto our pc my daughter was even more impressed as it has tagging features and also a world map where you move your photos to depending on which country you took the pictures in making the photos easier to find for future reference. Overall an excellent camera and well worth it's money. I don't have to worry about dropping this camera or getting it wet.|#|Other thane the picture quality I cannot find any other faults with this camera.
8.0|#|waterproof and easy to use, fun colours to choose from and has a good internal memory.|#|there is no shutter over the camera's lense, so I fear this could get scratched, dirty or damaged, ruining picture qulaity. Also doesn't come with a sleave or pouch.
9.0|#|COMPACT AND EASY TO USE. USER MANUAL AVAILABLE ON THE CAMERA HELP TO REMEMBER HOW TO USE OTHER FEATURE AT THE TIME OF USE|#|NONE
8.0|#|Small and compact. Easy to carry around in pocket without case. Freezeproof.|#|Had to remove glove to take picture as button was small which is not good for your hands in sub zero temperatures.
8.0|#|made for heavy use|#|small buttons and zoom difficult
10.0|#|Good looking and sturdy build. Very nice compact size which can easily fit into a pocket. Easy to use, and the menu system works well.|#|I can't seem to find a way of changing the default settings when the camera is switched on, I could on my previous Olympus. I would like the camera to start in 'Auto' mode very time rather than having to select it each time I turn the camera on.
5.0|#|i bought this camera for my holiday in egypt the fish were incredible it was like they wanted their picture taken the quality of photos was good and the camera was easy to use .|#|i only used the camera for 5 days and then it wouldnt work (it leaked)i was not happy as it is meant to be an underwater camera .
9.0|#|A nice little camera that still manages to look great whilst being really tough. Has all the features you would expect from a more professional level of camera.|#|Does have a bit more of a delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken than some other digital cameras I have had, which can cause a few forced grins before you get used to timing it right.
10.0|#|looks fantastic . the features are really good and think its very good value for money. very, very satisfied|#|
8.0|#|It looks and feels unbreakable.|#|
9.0|#|looks well made,  battery life is good,  fits in your pocket ,I hope itlives up to its name if - when I drop it.  Just right for a happy snapper but a photo  buff may well want a more fancy setup.(big lense syndrome)|#|Buttons a bit on the small side
10.0|#|I would recommend this camera|#|None found

9.0|#|Very robust, also great for the pool.|#|Not found any yet.
8.0|#|Well put together product|#|none so far
8.0|#|Brilliant images and very easy to use.  With all the shooting modes and multiple menu options it's everything you coukd ever want.  It's shockproof, waterproof and therefore should last a lifetime *****!|#|The menu can be quite complicated and the buttons don't glow in the dark or aren't lit in anyway so even though there is a night scene option it's not the easiest to use.
8.0|#|The camera can be used in many conditions which is excellent when out and about, especially with the variable British weather- it is light weight and small so will fit into a bag or pocket. It has a number of automatic settings that can be used to get excellent shots and with 12 mega pixels and a good internal memory the photographer can be up and running quickly. The camera is charged through a USB cable which can be plugged into a computer or into the mains via an adapter.|#|Fans of Olympus digital cameras will have to purchase SD memory cards as this camera does not use the usual Olympus XD card.  Time should be spent exploring the user changeable functions as this is the first setting when the camera is turned on- unless you remember to turn the camera to automatic.
10.0|#|This camera is fantastic, the image quality is amazing. The camera has lots of scenes to choose from when taking pictures so even when you are taking self protraits you can with ease. The camera is small and lightweight and it is very easy to take pictures.|#|The camera is quite a lot of money but you get what you pay for and because it is waterproof,shockproof then you would expect it to be more than a camera which isn't waterproof etc.
8.0|#|good camara for basic point and shoot, the fact that it's water proof and shock proof means you can take it almost anywhere.|#|Zoon and image is not brilliant but just enough for holiday snaps.
10.0|#|works after being underwater! great edit features to provde effects. a great 2nd camera to use on beach in water etc and have fun with shots.|#|Pcture qualty seems slightly nferior to other cameras in same bracket- not a great deal tho. all in all a brillant camera to use when conditions a bit rough for main camera.
5.0|#|It is great to have a camera that is allegedly so tough, time witl tell!!  I work travelling and am often in bad conditions, so I'm hoping this will do the job.|#|In bright light on an average English sunny day, when the camera is in the auto setting, the pictures come out with really bleached colours and the general quality is really disappointing.
10.0|#|Much smaller than I thought it would be. Excellent picture quality.Like all digital cameras it has a bewildering set of menuus and options, all of which you properly don,t need as a everyday camera user. Simply point and shoot and the pictures are great.|#|Because the camera is small and the buttons rubberised to make it waterproof, at first they feel fiddly and not very positive. But as with most things, once you get used to them, its not a problem.
9.0|#|Strong Tough Camera taking a battering with 40 Commando out in Afghanistan|#|Image quality could be better at this price but understand this is sacrificed at the expense of strength
10.0|#|Image quality is fantastic: I bought the camera to take up photography as a hobby but also just to take photos on a daily basis. My last camera was a 7mp Pentax that I bought in 2007, so this is a MAJOR improvement.|#|The only bad points is that it is sometimes a bit blurry with moving objects (but then again I don't know if my shutter speed is the cause of this!) and I miss a view finder but the screen does the job.
9.0|#|Good rate of shooting, for mutli-exposures, and the video quality is superb. would reccommend Lowepro Rezo 120 AW bag (fits the camera and twin lens nicely). The AW means all-weather: a cover for the bag to make it waterstant/shower proof.|#|Autofocus can be a little slow, but you get in to the habit of focussing near the action before taking th shot you want to capture. Lens lock on the 14-42mm takes a little getting used to, as you can't use it while its locked. Also the battery stays 'full' for a long time, but seems to go from full to empty pretty quickly: buy a spare battery.
10.0|#|I have the PEN in the white colour - a great size, it looks very retro in style and is gorgeous....I love it!|#|Lack of viewfinder; having said that I have purchased a VF-2 electronic viewfinder at an extra cost bumping up the price somewhat but I feel it is a must.
9.0|#|Very easy to carry around.  Great image quality.  I am a Canon SLR user but the bulk of the SLR meant I did not carry it around.  Now I bring this everywhere.  Video is good but would not replace a proper camcorder.  Would like if there was a manual focus switch on the side of the lens (18-42).  This camera is a great buddy/back-up camera for an SLR.|#|Nit Picking - I do not like the non-standard USB cable.
10.0|#||#|Should really come with a case at this price, but this sort of scrimping is normal these days.
7.0|#|good feel. good tech spec .ability to use OM2N lenses|#|on reflection might have preferred a viewfinder
10.0|#|The camera does exactly what you want to achieve. With manual option selected, you have full control over the picture quality and colour. The quality is similar to Nikon D300S and Nikon D700, so I was very surprised with the camera's quality and options.|#|The battary runs out quickly and it takes a long time to recharge. With auto option selected, you don't have enough influence over the colours.

9.0|#|small, light|#|video record button in bad place
8.0|#|Image quality is excellent and using the art filters is really fun. The camera has a lovely retro look and is simple to use, coming with a carry-strap as well.|#|Another minor negative is that it does take quite a while to save art-filter pictures and videos to the memory card, meaning that fast image capture is not an option.
8.0|#|Comprehensive set of features.|#|Non-intuitive controls.  VF-2 viewfinder not available as a bundled item.
10.0|#|LOTS of gizmos, gadgets and fancy bits!|#|I'm a learner so, length of time to get to know the camera - not really the cameras fault though!!
9.0|#|Great size and good optics.|#|The totally manual setting is a bit hard to get to grips with at first
10.0|#|Really like the size of the camera body and the fact that you can change lenses.  Like the art features and the general feel of the camera|#|I think the lens feels slightly inferior for build quality, compared to the camera and it is slightly too big when extended - wish there had been the option of lenses to match the colour of the body [white]
9.0|#|The olympus is very easy to use and very user friendly. It is a compact that behaves just like an SLR. The picture quality is excellent and downloading is very easy. Changing the lens is easy and very quick. All round a good starter for someone getting interested.|#|

10.0|#|I bought the camera for a sking holiday - the results were good pictures and amazing panoramic memories, point and shoot in intelligent mode gave good results whatever the situation.

9.0|#|Small, compact and sturdy build, I purchased this camera solely for underwater use in the Red Sea as I already have a higher spec Lumix digital camera, and I haven't been disappointed, it performed extremely well. Although it doesn't appear to waterproof on examination, it really is! At least ten sessions of an hour each snorkelling in the very salty Red Sea  produced hundreds of excellent images with not the slightest hint of damage to the camera. Early days yet, but so far, very Satisfied.|#|none so far!!

5.0|#|It's ability to withstand drops, sand and water makes it ideal for use with a toddler around, indeed my 2 year old son can use it himself!  If you need it for these features its a good buy.|#|It is very slow to respond and not particularly easy to change the settings of 'scene' features to allow you to take the photos your way.  If you need it as your main camera don't buy it.  You can buy a much better and easier camera to use if you don't need it to be so robust.
9.0|#|button is most useful.|#|None..........
9.0|#|I upgraded from an Olympus 1030 and the operation appears to be much easier now to use it underwater.  You can switch from still to cine with one button (no need anymore to remember how many clicks of the function wheel). The menu is much more intuitive with regard to changing flash setting say.  I have yet to use it underwater, but so far on dry land I am very pleased.|#|I have modified the wrist strap on both cameras by adding a cord ring  - so that I can slip the strap over my wrist then use the cord ring to tighten it to my wrist.  I was unhappy in taking the  it below the waves without the assurance that I would not loose it down below. The weight has also gone up which I am not too happy with.  I liked the idea of the previous model of having the photos recorded on the XD cards.  This meant that your could buy new cards if you wanted to and use the old one to store images until you had time to archive them properly.  Now you have to download them to say your hard disc on a regular basis.  Not so secure if you were to get hard disc problems - and had not backed up recently.  I can probably get used to the new way or working.

9.0|#||#|Sometimes takes a while to focus, and then gives blurred shots..I think its trying to be too clever
2.0|#|The tough qualities are impressive together with the waterproof qualities. The features are reasonable but that is where the good points end.|#|This camera is like using a digital camera from four years ago insomuch as the start up is extremely slow,the taking of the image is slow and  the picture quality is poor. I am a professional photographer of some 40 years and also a Fellow of the British Intitute of Professional Photography, shooting digitally for some 13 years so whilst I wouldn't expect the camera to match up with my professional cameras,  I would expect it to perform far better than it does.
9.0|#|Solid construction (for us who are hikers), bright photos ,attractive design!That's why we bought it!!!!!!|#|None up to now -after almost a month's use!!!!!!!
10.0|#|It is the best digital camera that can fit anywhere.|#|So if you want to record video you might want a larger lens.  This small lens can fit anywhere but it isn't like hd video from alot of other camcorders or large lens SLR HD cameras.

9.0|#|Nice nifty digital.You have option to go fully interactive automatic, including scenes, it you know nothing about photography or don't want to mess around changing options. Is great that you have the choice to go fully manual though, even if it involves several tweaks when you want to to this. There is plenty of choice for different modes.I used the camera on a recent weekend away and found most my pictures were off good quality, even if the exposure seems a bit low on using the 'i' mode sometimes.Overall, good value for money and good functions.|#|'I' auto mode is not always the best option to use, as can come out with camera shake/blur or under/overexposed in some situations. Taking me a little while to get used to how the manual override options work, as I am used to the options being on the buttons on my last Olympus. A novice to digital photography may find it a bit confusing with the scroll options for different functions. A bit concerned the body seems a little fragile in construction, but most cameras in this price range are like this now,I suppose.'I' Auto mode can under expose sometimes so worth using manual when you have time to play about.
10.0|#|I don't claim to know the first thing about Digital Cameras but this little one does the job great.  I had an Olympus C20 for donkeys years which was so good that I have not wanted to get rid of it so much so that the battery compartment is held down by sellotape!  So when I succumbed to getting a replacement, my obvious decision was to get another Olympus and I cannot find any fault with this one at all.  Very easy to use and good quality pictures - well at least I think so!|#|Haven't come across any yet

Good build quality.  Unfussy to use.  Instructions very clear and easy to get back to default settings if you've been overambitious in your search of the menus.|#|For the money, nothing to grumble about.  I'd always like a longer bit of string so I can put the camera around my neck - who slips it over their wrist?  But all manufacturers fall into this trap.  Cost of this alternative?  about and extra 10p!!

10.0|#|This is a perfect camera for the older photographer. It just fits so well in the hand, giving excellent control. This is so important with such a long zoom, couple this with the extremely good image stabilization and you have almost perfect shots every time. The different programs take care of almost every situation that you can think of for easy set up. I have just moved down from a full blown DSLR and haven't missed it at all. This is an excellent substitute.|#|The modes/programs have to be studied hard at first, as there are plenty of them, but they soon fall into place with a little use.

8.0|#|I had the old model of this camera and you can really see an improvement in the quality of the pictures with this model. I also like the large screen and the different scene settings and effects you can use (the 'fishbowl' and 'punk' modes made my friends and I laugh a lot!). It's slim and light and I love the vibrant pink colour. Overall I really like it and would recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably priced camera that is generally simple to use.|#|I was disappointed when I realised that the camera only takes SD/SHDC cards, rather than the XD card the previous camera had, which meant having to spend extra money. I would also prefer if there was a separate battery charger as with the old model, rather than having to plug the camera into a laptop. Also, I have only used the video a couple of times but I couldn't work out how to stop filming at first. My friend used the camera and also had the same problem. It has also taken a while to get used to locating everything, although that's probably due to having to adjust from the old model that I was used to.

7.0|#|Clear images,easy to get going|#|Lack of written instructions, have to use computer and I am a bit old fashioned and like to have a paper copy for easy referral. Probably should have chosen one with fewer functions as I find the multiple options a bit confusing. Good for someone with a more 'techy' brain than me.
9.0|#|Bought this as a camera to put in my pocket on occasions when the SLR was too bulky - it produces great photos, is very simple to use and very reasonably priced.|#|None as yet - quality better than expected for a small, inexpensive pocket camera
10.0|#|No need for a degree in photography to understand functions, picture quality is as good as my more expensive Nikon s.l.r. The optical zoom is best i have seen/used in a compact camera.|#|None to mention.

8.0|#|Makes no difference really, but I love the colour of the camera. Metallic red.|#|I wouldn't want to swap it though. For the price it is brilliant.

9.0|#|Very small, neat camera which is ideal to throw in my bag when holiday which is when it will get used the the most.  Would be ideal for anyone as it's easy from the start with more features that I can name!!|#|The different exposures take some getting used to as there is so many of them, but that's not really a bad thing, you just need to read the booklet.
9.0|#|Many very useful features, very easy to use once you know how.|#|The handbook comes on a computer disk and that means you have to either read the instructions from the computer or print them yourself - not ideal.

4.0|#|Lightweight and not too expesive|#|The first one purchased produced blurred images for the first 4 days before it packed in completely which was a great dissapointment to my son as it was a birthday present from his sisters, and wanted to take photos of his holiday. The replacement seems to be ok so far but it hasnt really been put to the test yet. It feels quite flimsy compared to my cannon and I dont hold out much hope for a long existence!
9.0|#|It is a small and compact camera good for people on te go! It is also very easy to use!|#|None really it suits my needs perfectly!
6.0|#|This camera is really small, not much bigger than my mobile phone, and smaller than a blackberry.  So easy to slip into small pockets.  It's light weight so will not add anything to flight luggage weight.|#|I'm dissappointed with the quality of the pictures as reproduced on my computer.  I have previously had cannon and Nikon cameras and their pictures looked crisper on my screen than these are but it suits me for what I want it for.
6.0|#|Love the size, colour and ease of use but disappointed that the image quality was grainy and not as good as my older olmpus which only has 3.2 megapixals.  Was expecting great things!|#|
9.0|#|Very easy to uas, I bought this camera, as I broke my exsisting one just before a holiday. Have been very pleased with this one. Great value for money.|#|Wish it had better zoom in properties, but that's a minor thing.
9.0|#|small and simple to operate|#|The computer software seems to be more complicated than the older versions with earlier cameras and not so easy to use.
8.0|#|It's small and light. It's rechargeable. It has a fairly large screen. The red version appeals to my wife.|#|It doesn't have the point-and-shoot simplicity my wife hoped for as it has many options to choose from. It would benefit from a printed manual rather than a CD. The auto-focus is a bit haphazard at close range and macro mode is fiddly to select and de-select.

9.0|#|This camera is great for when you want to document those moments in your life.  The quality and build of the pictures are great.  It is slim, fits into my purse easily and is works.|#|Not sure if it is my fault or not but when I take pictures without the flash they appear to be blurry. However when I do use the flash to take pictures at night the background is a lot darker than it is.  The time in between taking pictures could be a bit faster (have to wait a few seconds just to take another picture).
9.0|#|I've had a digital camera for sometime and never really got the hang of it, it was so complicated, I alway s wanted a return to the days of my olimpus trip! I read about this camera and its as it says on the box, great easy to use and I love it, from day one I understood how to use it, its has some great 'Magic: features that even I can use.

8.0|#|This camera is lightweight, easy to use and really user friendly. I am not the most technically minded person but am able to get my head around all the features of this product. It takes a great snap !!! I would definitely recommend it.|#|To be honest ..  I can't really think of any bad points. The image quality is sometimes a little shaky but that might be more to do with my photography skills.

9.0|#|A great camera so far,I have yet to fully test it's capabilities but so far so good|#|Battery life can be slightly disapponting
9.0|#|The 'crystal clear' screen is amazingly crisp underwater...though as tough as the camera is, the screen and casing strangely it isn't scratch resistant so be careful when around rocks and sand!|#|As with any waterproof camera, the battery life isn't amazing, although it did seem to perform better than reviews I've read for other makes/models. As such I would definitely recommend purchasing a spare battery to avoid dissapointment.
10.0|#|All round a good tool. The panorama program is excellent.|#|
2.0|#|Waterproof, drop proof, freeze proof...|#|I bought this camera after my brother has it and likes it, but he is'nt really into photography like i am and is happy with most of his holiday snaps being blurry and not of great quality. I on the other hand wanted a 'tough' compact camera to use in the situations when i don't want to take my DSLR. So i bought this camera, and was so disappointed. Firstly it's like a brick, it's really heavy and has very sharp corners. The shutter button is very hard to press down resulting in a bit of camera shake when you take a photo, with no vibration reduction to correct it. The menu/features button on the back is in the form of a joystick which is really quite hard to use, and you end up selecting different options than you actually wanted. It's also really slow, from turning it on, to it being ready to take a photo, is such a long time, by which time the moment will have passed. I also think the image quality is terrible unless you really take the time to hold the camera really steadily, which a lot of the time when trying to take a quick picture, isn't possible. On a night out recently i think 1 in every 4 photos were blurry. Overall, i think its a terrible camera and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I ended up getting the Nikon AW100 which is miles better.
9.0|#|Very well built, have been using when out mountain biking. the picture quality is very good and its not to hard to use. Get a screen cover because this could get scratched.|#|Some buttons are a bit small.

10.0|#|I bought this camera for my open water dive course and it performed with brilliance !!|#|the case to take this model of camera below 10 metres of water is more than the camera !!
10.0|#|Indestructible|#|High battery consumption on GPS
5.0|#|Only the larger screen has caught my attention!|#|For a camera that is supposedly for underwater use and in minus temperatures where you'd be wearing thick gloves the buttons are particularly small! When switching on it takes too long before you can use any functions or take a picture! I bought it online without being able to feel it in my hand first. I was disappointed in the bulkiness, weight and sharp sticky out bits that makes it uncomfortable in your pocket. The compass hasn't worked at all and I should put it back under warranty! My old Tough camera was much more user friendly but ultimately let in water which hastened my purchase of the latest offering!

10.0|#|Olympus is really easy to use and the camera body is strong, the photos are a good quality. lots of features including multi photo shooting  so you capture that moment. wide angle so you can squeeze the whole shot in...a clever camera. good value for money..wouldn't be without mine..had an older version before but this is even better..|#|none with camera, but wish manufacturers would sell with case and memory stick..although easy to get hold of later on..

The optical zoom is by far its biggest asset.|#|I'm not sure i could justify paying its RRP as i got this in the currys sale for less than half price. It does also feel a little cheap which i would not expect of such an expensive compact.
10.0|#|takes brilliant pictures, great zoom, best camera i have owned, and small enough to fit easily in your pocket , really clear images and lovely colours. A+|#|make sure to buy the starter kit at the same time, (hard case and memory card ) or you cannot set it up !!!  it is a little technical but i will get there !
9.0|#|This is a very light camera and takes a steady picture|#|Took us a while to figure out some of the features although to be fair the camera we had before was extremely basic
9.0|#|Small enough to keep in a handbag which is why I chose this camera.|#|Being an beginner I have to keep going back to the manual to learn the features to get the best effects as there are quite a lot...but this is me not the camera and I will learn but at the moment it can hinder spondaneity!
9.0|#|Bought this camera for my mother so it had to be straightforward to use. The picture quality is really good and it has some good features whch are also easy to grasp. I am now considering purchasing one myself.|#|It early days and we haven't come across any bad points to date.

9.0|#|Fairly easy to use for someone not technically minded.  Really clear pictures taken outside.  Love the colour.|#|At the moment when taking pictures of the children I sometimes get blurred pictures when taking them indoors.  This is probably down to the fact I have not got the settings right as yet than the fault of the camera.

10.0|#|Slightly low resolution sensor, but massively high quality images. Almost noise free. Would be happy to blow up, sharpen and print to around A3, no higher though. If you, like me, are getting back into photography, or are testing the waters, this is an ideal camera. Build quality is excellent. Handles great.|#|Needs a grip for longer lenses, otherwise slippery. You'll need to import the custom part from Richard Franiec . Only 12 megapixels.
10.0|#|Size feature set good handling for such a small light camera|#|material finish is very slippy. Would have apprectiateed non slip
9.0|#|Outstanding value for money.|#|Figuring out how to apply the manual controls took a bit of effort but is not beyond understanding.  A combination of reading the manual and experimentation (which in the digital age costs nothing) gets the results.
9.0|#|light to carry around, lots of different pre-set scenes, removable flash, tilting display. I have not tried to print any pictures yet but the image is very good on the computer. I have only had the camera for 3 weeks so unable to comment on the build quality as much but so far I have had not issues. Switched to PEN because I got tired of carrying my DSLR around. Loving the fact it is small and I can still choose from wide selection of different lenses.|#|
9.0|#|Takes fantastic shots in auto mode whilst allowing for a greater degree of creativity through either live view, art mode or the manual settings. The build quality is superb and I have no real issue with the grip.|#|I am disappointed that the panorama mode is such a faff... I see the new iphone (phone!) has a much better function, the interface isn't the best and add ons like a viewfinder are very expensive. These are fairly minor gripes however, for what is mostly a wonderful bit off kit.
10.0|#|This camera is quriality Fantastic price  and picture quality is Fantastic|#|
10.0|#|The camera is excellent for those wishing to migrate away from the point and shoot to something with a bit more substance - the camera will show you the effects of changing ISO, shutter speed and aperture levels before the picture is taken, enabling you to fully their effects on the image.|#|Expensive hotshoe acessories.

Fabulous camera, menus simple and to the point, easy controls and IQ is excellent, had a Panasonic G3 but could not get on with it, this camera is a little gem.|#|Only annoying point is at 4:3 photo ratio the sides are blacked out on LCD. But I got over that after seeing the IQ.

9.0|#||#|No built in viewfinder.
9.0|#|Much easier to use than I had anticipated. Lots of features and it's really easy to zoom just by turning the lens. Very lightweight and looks amazing. Perfect bridge camera.|#|
10.0|#|Overall, it's a nice buy. Would have bought it for full-price|#|I bought a bundle set which included a logic camera case, could say, that it was too small, cause Olympus doesn't fit in it with its lens. So, I needed to buy another case in order to fit all the belongings safely.
9.0|#|This camera produces SLR quality photos with the body of an small compact camera so it is easy to carry around with you. The camera has some great art filters which are fun to play around with. The auto mode is very easy to use and can be used for most everyday photos adapting a point and shoot idea. If you are wanting a more photographic experience it is simple to change setting such as aperture, shutter speed and ISO.|#|I have not found any bad points about using this camera yet!
9.0|#|Size is just right, finally an exchangeable lens system small enough to replace a pocket camera. Good image quality, opportunity to use weide range of legacy lenses with adapter (my main reason to purchase this camera)|#|Nothing so far.
9.0|#|Great fun for a point and shoot convert without the size and expense of a DSLR|#|Feels plasticy.  No case.  Lens cap will be easily lost.
9.0|#|Looks brilliant, sounds brilliant and takes great photos and videos.|#|Nothing bad to say about the E-PM1 itself but the accessories are pretty expensive. I would quite like a viewfinder but at £130+ I might hold on for a while,
10.0|#|Extremely fast image capture, the quality of the images take is outstanding, very easy to use. Great camera i recommend it :)|#|The zoom is very small on the lens, only equivalent to x3 optical zoom. If you want to buy a different lens such as the 40 - 150 mm it cost more than the camera so take into consideration when buying the camera :)
9.0|#|Light, easy to handle, good traveling company, different body colours|#|No flash in the body
9.0|#|ease of use are the standouts - fantastic colour rendering plus good low-light performance matches with an intuitive interface|#|Quite large with 14-42mm lens ie. won't fit in your pocket. Much smaller than a DLSR but you'll still need a true compact for snaps

7.0|#|The camera is compact and good looking. Photos are good quality.|#|There was a fluttering noise on video ( i found a video online , of some crows , with exactly the same noise problem on the video) . I sent the camera back, then bought a more expensive lumix tz30 which i am delighted with.
9.0|#|Compact, easy to use, fantastic zoom, great features and effects.|#|Battery life could be better, so need to have spares and charger when away for more than a day.
9.0|#|Sleek finish, feels good to hold. Many features including panorama stitch. Fairly intuitive to use.|#|Start-up manual is very basic; you have to download the detailed manual on supplied CD for instructions on main functions. Also no memory card provided.

10.0|#|Totally recommend to anyone who wants a point and shoot but with massive zoom, lots of functionality  and unsurpassed quality for this type of camera.|#|Flash has to be separately raised if you want it on but this is only a small gripe. Quality far outweighs this small annoyance!
10.0|#|Crystal clear picture|#|Not found any so far

8.0|#|Waterproof and easy to use. Bought for beach holiday. It was waterproof.|#|Noisy video underwater, easily sorted out by switching the microphone off.
9.0|#|Just what I need.|#|
8.0|#|Tough.  Some interesting features, and wizzing on-board image processing functions.  A lot to learn, but we've had some nice results already.|#|Nature of 'TOUGH' design is that external buttons and switches have to be limited, so menus end up a bit deep - a lot to learn.
9.0|#|Excellent picture quality, sturdy feel and lots of added-value extras.|#|Be prepared to recharge the battery at the end of a day's shooting.

8.0|#|Very easy to use|#|Also, recording:  it has no pause button, which is probably one of the main features which should have been built in
10.0|#|Everything about the camera was excellent.|#|none
10.0|#|would definately recommend this camera.|#|the only bad point I can think of is that the booklet that comes with it doesn't go into too much depth about the different functions how to use the camera but it doesn't take too much working out so that not really an issue either.
9.0|#|Takes a good clear picture provided you do not try to rush the shot with resultant out of focus.|#|Being small the controls are not always easy to control particularly in cold weather or with stiff rheumaticy fingers
7.0|#|Very good photo quality.  LOVE the colour, easily sighted!  High res. photos in bright light or with the flash. Overall a good, value for money camera.|#|When in good daylight or using flash but in less than bright light the image will not focus and will come out fuzzy - and flash is a cold blueish colour.
10.0|#|Light and compact for travelling|#|no bad points with the actual camera but when I ordered it I presumed it would come complete with memory card and case.
9.0|#|Does everything I need.|#|Record button too small.

10.0|#|Very small but with a good size viewing screen.  Good zoom and fast shutter speed which helps when taking pictures of children.|#|I tried to add the camera to my gadget insurance which comes free with my bank account but found that this model number does not exist in their list of Olympus cameras.  Not the fault of Olympus of course but still a bit of a niggle.  Perhaps it is a limited edition!
8.0|#|Its easy to use and I love the layout of the camera|#|The image is not what i expected it to be
8.0|#|Compact with useful Zoom and movie ability|#|Battery ran down very quickly when using flash or short movie sequences. Having to print out instruction manual. Very time consuming and wastes paper (but sates Olympus).
1.0|#|Excellent build quality and good features at a very reasonable price.|#|Worst quality prints I have ever produced!   If you are after a clear / sharp photograph, then avoid this camera like the plague!  I could not believe how poor the prints were, so much so that I took the photos along with the camera back to the shop, they apologized, were genuinely disgusted and insisted I have a full refund and apology!

10.0|#|Well whats to say, as my first digital camera it is all I could want and more.When I first read up on the specs I though that it could do every thing that I would need but once reading the full details in the CD ROM manual I have discovered it does even more!To top it all off it is compact enough and actually looks how a camera should look.Do not hesitate. Buy now.|#|The only point I can think of is that the hard copy manual is a little bit sparse when it comes to expalining all the camera can do. You really need to get access to the CD ROM version (supplied) to realise the complete package.Otherwise it could take you some time to discover everything this great little camera can do.
6.0|#|Light weight, Large viewing screen, view finder in addition to screen better for viewing photo subject especially when sunny and not possible to see subject on screen, choice of manual over rides, large optical voom.|#|The build quality one of the connection cover appears to only be attached by a thin strip of plastic, its is impossible to see the subject on the viewing screen in sunny conditions either to take or to view a photo.

10.0|#||#|some people say the colour but i love it, camera is amazing the quality is as good as i ever would want, with larger amount of pixels comes more memory space taken up and at around 1-1.5mb per picture i think that is plenty. i wouldnt souly buy this camera for the brightcapture function but it is very good, but picture quality is hugely decreased. its brilliant for taking pictures of babies though when there is limited light because not wanting to dazzle them with the bright flash.

9.0|#|Very small fits into pocket, doesn't bulk out the handbag.  Easy to use and has large viewing screen for it's size.  Has pretty quick response time from when you press button to taking the photo - I'm sure there is a proper photographic phrase for that.|#|Handling can be fiddly if hands are cold because the camera is very small.  When the saver mode is on it doesn't switch back on immediately, so sometimes by the time you are ready to take the shot the saver mode has switched on - you maybe able to lengthen this time but as the camera is relatively new to me I've not read all the instruction book!

It's also able to be connected straight to the computer, so we didn't have to go out and get a seperate card reader.|#|There is a small time lapse between pressing the button and taking the photo (which is a common digital trait) is the only downside, but we tried out a few others in shops before buying this, and there are lots that are much worse, and only one that seemed to be faster, but it didn't have half the features this camera has.

9.0|#|Super macro produces really good results in flower studies.  Pop-up flash makes camera neat.  Zoom feature an asset when studying animal/bird life.  Easy to use menu.  Basic but easy to follow hard copy manual.  Long-lasting lithium battery assisted by the cameras sleep mode.|#|Mode dial can easily be changed accidentally.
9.0|#|The internal zoom lens has a good range, rechargeable battery is excellent|#|Could have wider lens angle?
8.0|#|It takes photos! I like the zoom|#|Learning to use it, especially downloading photos - I am computor illiterate
7.0|#|An outstanding amount of extra's only normally found on a very expensive camera and the very good zoom feature|#|3 The catalogue of extra equipment that can be purchased seems very limited I am thinking about filters and flash accessories.
8.0|#|Excellent zoom but remember to pop up the flash just in case - not automatic|#|
8.0|#|High quality images, with easy to use editing and printing software. The features built into this camera are excellent. My wife used it on safari and the results were spectacular.|#|In full automatic mode the delay between pressing the shutter and the image been captured is very long and not suited to rapid fire images or to fast action in that mode.
9.0|#|Lightweight. The video option is great because the only limit on the length of clip is the size of memory card|#|
8.0|#|Reasonable pictures, good optical zoom.|#|Memory card somehow became corrupted and some photos lost or damaged.
9.0|#|Small, lightweight, full auto point and shoot facility or manual control, different image quality settings|#|Flash does not always work on auto function, delay of a second or 2 on auto focus when trying to take a quick shot
7.0|#|The c765 is a good quality camera with very good results.|#|Not an easy camera to get to grips with and not for any technophobes.
7.0|#|Lightweight, compact. Good images, powerful zoom. Reasonable display. Good battery life (but worth buying a spare, approx. £35). Excellent macro shots.|#|Rattly lens barrel can be disconcerting, though it doesn't affect picture quality. Flash flips up in a very clunky fashion. Menu system can be awkward, especially for some fairly frequent functions e.g. file delete. Poor responsiveness and focussing in low light conditions. Shutter delay between pressing and taking picture can be quite significant and results in missing lots of shots e.g. changing facial expressions; this can be a problem even in natural light, and is particularly problematic in low light / flash shots. Digital zoom is virtually worthless and awkward to use. Flash not powerful enough to service zoom shots (e.g. of the stage at a school play). Focussing during zoom can be slow.
9.0|#|Compact,not too heavy, relatively easy to use,software easy to use,good quality pictures|#|Hard to focus in low lighting situations

8.0|#||#|Batteries do not hold their charge for long.  Don't bother buying cheaper batteries as they are poor in the long term.  One year on and my replacement is dead!  Stick with the Olympus ones.
7.0|#|A versatile camera with more features than most within the same price range.|#|Slightly awkward to use at first, being very sensitive to movement by the user.  But produces good results once the correct methods are used.

8.0|#|Images good.|#|Build apparently flimsy.Only time will tell.
8.0|#|Very good zoom and picture quality|#|Easy to forget to pop up flash - should be automatic or warning on screen/viewfinder
9.0|#|Optical zoom fantastic|#|not easy to get into video option with sound
7.0|#|flexibility of the lens - ie wide to telephoto|#|Sometimes difficult to get sharply focussed pictures.  This may be due to my unfamiliarity with the camera.  Also flash can be very harsh
8.0|#|Well built, solid feel. Excellent zoom lens.|#|Focus and auto exposure difficult in poor light and high contrast situations
8.0|#||#|The worst thing, and it really is a pain, is the view on the screen. In a bright ambient light it is very difficult to see and viewfinder isn't much better.
9.0|#|Excellent Macro and Night shooting modes. Better than expected battery life between charges.Takes fantastic crisp low light shots and the Ten X zoom works superbly.|#|software package poor, no simple 'send or share command'available so E mailing images is cumbersome.My very old Sony Mavica E mail fascility is simple and instant the camera is very old so Olympus have no excuses with the C765.

8.0|#|Good zoom,reasonable bettery life|#|Not good in indoor or other low light conditions
8.0|#|It's got an excellent 10x optical zoom lens, which is hard to find on a camera at this price level|#|The xD card is not as common as say a SD card, but that is the only real criticism.
10.0|#|Small, easy to carry, relatively easy to use, simple to transfer images to computer.  Excellent camera.|#|Pictures transferred to computer/paper sometimes not as good as on camera view.
9.0|#|Excelent 35mm replacement for basic photography.  Finding your way around the various menus takes a bit of memorisation, but once you know where the menus are that you need there is little problem doing what you need to do with the camera.|#|Not so good at focusing in low light conditions - I found this a real handicap at a recent outdoor concert.
10.0|#|The Camera is Compact and the quality of pictures is good, the zoom capabilities are very useful.|#|No sound on movie replay.

9.0|#|Very impressed with the quality of the camera, images taken and the ease of use.|#|The Olympus software for processing the images was good until the point of copying to CD. I had to purchase Olympus upgrade software and then found that my CD drive was not compatable - therefor the software was usless! An upgrade was done by Olympus naming my CD Drive but failed to work.

The quality of photos are generally absolutely superb, especially when taken with the appropriate special function selected.|#|This camera has a huge number of functional features which, whilst to some extent are intuitive, do take some learning.    It is also slightly larger and heavier than smaller equivalents, but this is not surprising given its robust construction.    The capacity of the flash card supplied as standard is useless - for what they cost now, why do manufacturers not include a card with sensible capacity?
8.0|#|Strong build, easy to use, loads of features.|#|Battery life not so long.
10.0|#|Easy to use, small, great for use underwater. Buy the Olympus water proof case and straps to go with it - makes use  in the sea/pools even better as the strap can go on your arm leaving your hands free when not taking photos.|#|In bright sunshine you can not see the image on the screen to take a picture!... Sometimes you just have to point and hope!.. Having said that I think this is a fantastic, easy to use camera for those of us that don't have much photography knowledge!

I am always fairly sceptical about anything claiming to be shock proof and water proof, but the 1030 lives up to its billing.|#|Image quality not quite up there with the best compact cameras, but for something as almost indestructable as this, you have to overlook some things.
10.0|#|Super easy to use camera. Most adjustments can be easily made by pressing menu or the centre OK button whilst in auto mode. I usually like to read the manual but this camera is fairly intuitive. Have used this camera in all conditions including 45 mile an hour winds and have been very happy with the results of pictures taken whilst being buffeted and i didn't even use the handshake setting.Fits neatly into your pocket so no need for a bulky camera case. Great for walking, scrambling and climbing.|#|Some photos seem to turn out a little darker than expected but that may be operator error, time will tell.

9.0|#|The only problem i have with it is the size|#|The only problem i have with it is the size which makes it very difficult to handle, not very sure if its the shape. You have to be careful to handle it else it might slip from your hands, apart from that i love this product.

3.0|#|compact with lots of memory|#|picture quality poor, auto functions poor, flash suspect. gave it to my daughter to see whether she has more success. Gone back to using my Olympus C-3000
10.0|#|The camers is extremely easy to use. I haven't even had to refer to the instruction booklet yet. Olympus has kept the way the camers functions similar to previous models, so getting a newer camera doesn't mean learning a new way of operating it. This makes life so much easier. The camera is suitable for simple snapshots, or for taking more detailed photographs.|#|The buttons on the camera are very small, so care must be taken not to hit the wrong one. But considering the camera's size (and the sizes of similar models from other manufacturers) this would be expected.

9.0|#|Size, price and image quality. Really liked the ability to select a scene that you want to take a picture of and it selects the options. The best feature though of all is the scene selection for maximising low light. Pictures come out brilliantly and I even use this in the day to prevent flag or enhance the picture quality in shadows, for example flowers or scenes which, to the naked eye look good, but to normal camera's come out bad. With this option it comes out as good as I see it.|#|Auto face recognition and tracking feature I have noticed on other models but apart from this its great! This feature is not that much of a draw back though so minor bad point.

Even trying to focus to take a picture was difficult when the child etc was moving as this blurring occured. i had previously had an Olympus MU500 and it was so good i decided to return to Olympus, this camera has put me off. Perhaps it's because this was a cheaper version of my original super wee Olympus.
9.0|#|EASE OF USE|#|NO CARRY CASE
3.0|#|I've used several Olympus cameras in the past (work camera), and so I'm familiar with the menu and layout.  Easy to use in this respect.  Camera is a good size and not too weighty.  LCD display is easy to use and a good size.|#|I have to use Olympus cameras as part of my work, because our company use Camedia and will not support any other camera type.  Unfortunately, this camera is terrible, and if I could, I would use another brand at the drop of a hat.  Long delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken.  Most of my photos turn out blurred, despite half-pressing the button to engage the auto-focus before taking a photo (as recommended).  Blueish halo-effect around buildings, where they meet sky.  Overall, extremely disappointing, as I like to take many photos of the places I've visited and more often than not, the photographs are poor.  This camera appears to produce the same results as the 3 previous digital Olympus models I've used.

Easy Scene management which allows you quickly to select the appropriate automatic setting very quickly. Good level of optical zoom (5x), which is more than most 8mp camera I have looked at. Battery life is good so far and replacement batteries are not expensive.|#|Occasional night time photographs are not quite as good, but mainly only when utilising the flash.
7.0|#|very simple point and shoot easy to use camera.|#|still unsure about robustness of camera-not used it enough yet to comment.      needs memory card,memory very limited without one and would be good if it came with a case.

I have not had much of a chance to use it as I have not been able to get out for a while. My previous camera was an Olympus C700 which was a fantastic camera in its day. I read all the reviews before buying the 590UZ so therefore I may have had conditioned myself with its limitations ( such as they are) - It suits me fine.|#|Battery life is an issue as always - I use rechargeable items but they don't last as well as non rechargeable of course.

7.0|#|Very compact - slips easily into the pocket. O K for general photography as long as the subject is still.|#|Being used to a digital SLR for my main photography I have some difficulty coming to terms with: 1: seeing the image when in bright sunlight, 2: the delay between composing the picture and the camera registering the image, 3: the limited battery life (I have bought 3 extra batteries to cope with this), 4: At one point I was unable to control the various flash options - which I only overcame by removing both memory card and battery and re-inserting them, ie re-programming the whole camera, 5: the colour rendition is quite 'cold' compared with that from my DSLR (a Canon 400D), 6: only suitable for photgraphing static subjects - even when photographing my 1 year old granddaughter the results are very hit and miss - hence the need to take many shots and delete many, taking up battery power in the process.

10.0|#|An easy to use camera that can be taken anywhere.  Its small and compact but doesn't lose any image quality.|#|You have to purchase the memory card which is an extra cost

10.0|#|it is good in the swiming pool and in snow .the camera is brillant and cannot be betaen for value|#|
9.0|#|Really simple to use sturdy little camera with very good image quality and good quality on video recording|#|
9.0|#|Easy point and shoot operation. Very quick to switch on and be able to take a picture (Very important in Disney parks!!). Love the shock proof and waterproof features (although haven't had to test these out (yet!).|#|Very occasionaly, if you don't press the button quite in the middle correctly it doesn't take a picture and you have to release and re-press.
2.0|#|great for close ups and under water|#|Zoom is rubbish.... does not zoom in close enough and anything that is mving if you don;t remeber to put it on the right setting for movement it just comes out a blur
10.0|#|brilliant camera especially when our jet ski tipped over and I fell in to the sea with my camera strapped to my arm luckily it was waterproof, I love it|#|
9.0|#|Great family camera - Toddler proof (well as much as it can be). I bought this for my wife who's (accidentally) nearly drowned her last camera and it had more dents in it then I could count. So far this one's coping admirably with the trials and tribulations of being a mum with a 3 yr old.|#|Paper manual doesn't cover all the featurer - have to crack open the accompanying CD-ROM to learn how to use the more advanced features.
8.0|#|It is waterproof, shockproof and freezeproof and fairly simple to use. The guide on the camera is useful for quick tips and the buttons all link to useful features and are clearly labelled - no ambiguous buttons on this camera!|#|It does not seem to have a black and white picture mode, which usually, I would use a lot on a camera.
8.0|#|Easy to use, great for outdoors|#|Pictures not always great in the dark, slow to take pictures
9.0|#|I love it, easy to use compared to my old camera. Compact and robust, great for taking photos of dogs in the rain.|#|Battery doesn't seem to last long and is rubbish when the temperature is cold. Solved this by buying a spare battery!
8.0|#|waterproof and very robust|#|cant find any
9.0|#|until I have used it for longer.|#|
10.0|#|Best point is that you can take it underwater without a case up to 3m without having to change any settings etc. Very easy to use in general with plenty of different settings and the pictures are always very clear.|#|The camera strap doesn't have the part to tighten it around your wrist which makes it more likely to fall off.

9.0|#|Excellent build quality and packed with features.  Instant fix for red eye and picture quality is very good.|#|Face recognition is sometimes hit and miss.  Picture quality is not as sharp as I would have expected.
9.0|#|Good image quality|#|Position of the lens, top left, can make it easy to part cover with finger when taking pictures in portrait
9.0|#|Agood quality camera with the advantage yo dont have to treat ti with kid gloves.Simple to use on auto ,just starting to get into the more advanced fearures(of which there are many). all in all excellent value for money.|#|No method of direct charging (you have to remove the battery and charge in the supplied charge) A spare battery is therefore a must ,but not expensive
8.0|#|this one fitted the bill.|#|The overall picture quality may be inferior to a halfway decent digital camera costing half the price, but without the sturdiness of the build of the Olympus.
9.0|#|Excellent robust camera. I bought it for my daughter and it is ideal for her. She can take it anywhere and not have to worry about handling it carefully.|#|Although the picture quality may not by quite up to a Canon, it far exceeds the picture quality of a Canon full of water, or that has been dropped down stairs!
8.0|#|macro setting with LED drains the battery quite fast|#|not so good on the low iso settings - quite a lot of image noise
8.0|#|Product has many features but the automatic settings make it easy to use.|#|Quite complex owing to the number of features available, some of which I probably won't ever use.
10.0|#|love this camara, it is so easy to use and the screen is a good size. Also all the different options you have for when your taking your photos i.e. taking a picture behind glass. This was great on my recent holiday, when I saw fantasic views from the coach.|#|haven't found any

10.0|#|A fantastic camera all round especially if you have young children (like we do 3 of them) and they happen to get hold of it and accidently drop it - a bit like the kids version of the Vtech only smaller!!!  it also has a fantastic built in video player which has enabled us to get rid of our video camera and you can switch very easy from taking photos to taking video.  We bought this camera ourselves 2 months ago and paid a little more than what they are selling for today and then bought another as a christmas present for a family member as we were very happy with it.|#|

10.0|#|Always had Olympus in the past and would always have one in the future.|#|
9.0|#|Solid,compact and a very near little camera, i bought it to take snorkelling on holiday and have already used it when kayaking to great effect.  When you consider the cost of buying and developing disposable waterproof cameras and then throwing away half the photos it makes buying onw of these little beauties a no brainer.  You can keep this camera with you wherever you go without worrying about it getting knocked about or soaking wet, brilliant.|#|Battery life could be better, a little bulkier then some of the new slim digitals down to its tough build and it would have been a great improvement to have a mini usb socket for charging and connecting up to a pc instead of their own specific connection socket. Minor quips though, spend the extra on spare battery and buy one now you wont be dissapointed!
9.0|#|underwater settings|#|haven't found any so far
9.0|#|Excellent camera with good picture quality and for our use water and dust resistance is a must|#|Having to remove the battery to charge!
10.0|#|waterproof!|#|
10.0|#|The camera has an amazing under water feature, really clear underwater images, took it surfering and got some great shots. Also the shake feature is brilliant, took it on a roller coaster and the photos came out clear and steady.A geat camera for action shots.|#|
9.0|#|Great photos underwater, just the zoom isn't that brillant out of the water, but I bought it specifically for underwater photography and its durability.|#|It never came with it's on case.
8.0|#|The focus mechanism is inside the camera, so I am pretty hopeful that this camera will survive many years of hard use. Amazing anti vibration mode - will take sharp photo's even in the worst shaking you can give it - would be good for action shots.|#|Slow to write to the card - meaning a frustrating time to wait between shot, also suspect battery life may be poor (but could just be as new battery).
9.0|#|waterproof! and what a bargain!|#|I would prefer this to take standard SD cards, as opposed to Micro SD but thats all i can fault it on really. And only cos i had to buy more memory- which was pretty cheap anyway.
10.0|#|Water and shock proof. Very well made, looks like it can take the knocks that it's designed for. Big, clear screen. Buttons big enough to use underwater. Very quick flash i.e. it's ready within a second or 2 of turning it on.|#|None so far!

8.0|#|Fantastic zoom and picture quality in a small camera that's easy to carry in your pocket or handbag|#|
9.0|#|Takes lovely clear pictures. Easy to use.  Best thing is the zoom which is incredible.  The macro and super macro are good.  Beauty feature seems good too.  You can use the automatic settings where the camera decides for you the best setting for your situation, or manual where you can choose exposure for yourself.|#|Some of the features are a bit pointless, such as the watercolour and punk. Would rather have had a black and white feature.  The cat and dog recognition is a bit silly too.  I tried it and it recognises other things as a pets face and takes a pic when you don't want it to.
10.0|#|Great picture quality, very good zoom, loads of different picture settings. Feels really well built and very comfy in your hands. Really good value for the money.|#|Battery life is a bit short, can be a little slow to process picture to memory card and could do with a view finder.
7.0|#|Really Easy to set up|#|No auto flash, you have to remember to lift it up first.
9.0|#|Excellent value|#|Does not come with SDHC card
9.0|#|Very simple to use and takes some cracking shots. Auto panorama shots make capturing landscapes so simple and the 3D photo option is also a great idea, but only for non moving subjects as you have to take 2 images.|#|The only real gripe is that it lacks some of the more manual overrides that some people may like. That said, it's great for what it supposed to be, a good quality super zoom compact.
10.0|#|Superb image, amazing features and excellent value for money.|#|A screen protector would be a good addition and a matching case is expensive.
9.0|#|The camera is brilliant easy to use with an explanatory feature for each function.|#|Haven't found any yet

10.0|#|Have only had the camera for a month or so now, but it is so easy to use and have got some great images already.|#|None yet
10.0|#|I really loved this product which gave me a chance to take amazing professional photos with a compact camera. The micro photos are just amazing. Just spend some time in discovering the features and enjoy your time!|#|The only point is, you need to find the right player for the video recordings. The visual matial cannot synchronize with the audio on iPad and the quality is really poor on real player and windows media player.
9.0|#|Good|#|
9.0|#|great mid range camera with more features than you could possibly need all for the price of a budget camera|#|Camera case very expensive,lens cover strap is a piece of cotton and broke first time we used it.
9.0|#|I like the way the lens cover pops off when i turn it on.|#|
9.0|#|Beaches, pools, the bottom of a beer glass (oops), skiing, climbing (and falling)... you name it, the Olympus survives it.|#|It's indestructible, but you can still lose it :(

10.0|#|Great for underwater photos!|#|
9.0|#|in clean water, it has cleaned up very easily.|#|The only down side to what I put the camera through is that it has got scratched. This is not really a bad point and have I rectified this problem by purchasing a good quality / durable case as previously it was just hung around my neck or the pocket of my PFD.
9.0|#|Very pleased with this camera, so far it has survived the sea a swimming pool and is about to be tested in snow.|#|Bit disappointed at how easily the screen on the back scratches, for a 'tough' camera I would expect better.
10.0|#|excellent picture and video quality|#|4 way control switch sticks up and moves too easily and changes settings before you realise it has changed. not like previous version which was flush and still easy to use
9.0|#|seems to have stood up well to very rainy and rough conditions climbing, camping, dancing with the camera in hand, rollling on sand etc. Fairly clear menu system.|#|none so far
8.0|#|Ease of use and videoing.|#|Lens in the wrong place my finger showed in some pictures and  videos I had to keep remembering to move my finger.
10.0|#|An all round great camera for the price. It was worth paying that bit extra for that reassuring tough feel.|#|Why don't they add some rubberized style grip to the body. It would make it easier to hold.
9.0|#|tough, plenty of feature for kids and teens to enjoy, waterproof|#|average image quality but great enough for kids and teens that take snapshot. better waterproof cam and double the price, so...
9.0|#|to early to really tell|#|confusing at first to find programe changes
10.0|#|This was amazing and perfect for our first holiday! Took it snorkelling and scuba diving ! Camera says waterproof up to 5m but we took it 8m and was fine! Amazing picture underwater and out of water! 10/10 loved it!|#|Nothing!
10.0|#|Easy to use I just picked the camera up and started using without having to read any instructions as they come up on the screen each time you use a different mode.Great underwater pictures. GREAT CAMERA|#|When under water i found that I was pressing the mode buttons on the back of the camera as i was trying to take pictures using one hand as I was trying to swim with the other hand, although, I then changed the way I held the camera and the pictures were great. I will purchase a cord that I can adjust on my wrist as i found the one supplied kept coming off my wrist whilst in the sea as it is loose on your wrist.
9.0|#|Ease of use underwater, good quality pictures.|#|No wrist band with item, and for use whilst underwater that is a must.
10.0|#|Easy to use, great specification, idiot proof - only idiots can't manage to use it.|#|Nothing bad
9.0|#|A few to mention so i will attempt to condense. The f1.8-2.7 lens is really a boon to have. Allows so much more light into camera at all focal lenghs. The control ring around the lens so useful and adaptable. A max of 12mps on a small sensor allows for much better image quality that those silly larger numbers favoured by so many others. Raw support. A Must Have. Numerous adjustments to be made on settings. Even the Flash !! Real Fast Auto Focusing. I mean Fast !! compatibility with uhs 1 cards meaning it can rattle of continous shots at 5fps without slowing down or dropping frames for...well i gave in at like 60 shots. Image quality for photos up to iso 800 to me appear Excellent. Even up to 1000 iso is still Great. Yes. it does these small incrimentals on the iso scale. Being able to Cap ISO at your choose preference another major plus. The scroll wheel at the back working in conjunction with the control wheel upfont for instant adjustments. So Useful. The Clear and Bright Touch Screen with its ability to Touch focus and Capture instantly. Low light photography another plus. Bokeh due to that Fast lens another plus as is its riduculously close macro shooting ability. its Creative Arts and Scenes mode . Full manual controls. A very good iauto Function for those who are initially overwhelmed by the manual Choices present. Have i mentioned that its Video capability is just as Awesome as its stills functions. full 1080p at 30fps is available here and the results look real impressive on its screen and even more so on a HDTV . Oh the xz10  Is small almost discreet and that certainly makes it a carry anywhere pocket camera . Theres even more to praise about this camera  but i have said enough already and i think you can rightly assume i HIGHLY RECOMMEND it . Well Done Olympus. You've made me a Fan Boy.|#|would have been nice to have a 10x zoom instead of 5 but hey... the 'superzoom digital function' that gets to that length works surprisingly well.
9.0|#|The fast lens was the one thing I was desperate for and this is the business! Its got a bundle of amazing features for such a little camera. I loved my old 35mm Stylus which I bought in New York in 1996 for $99, and this little beauty brings back a lot of fond memories.|#|The pop up flash should be built into the front of the body as your finger naturally rests on top of it.

10.0|#|This is the type of digital camera I've been waiting for. A compact with an SLR size sensor and lens system. For outdoor use, up mountains and on moorland, it easily hangs beneath a coat with it's flat profile ready for quick use. The controls are well thought out, and to use in A or S modes it can adjusted as easily and quickly as  the old 35mm compacts could. Equally easy to access are the pre-set shooting modes, but they don't dominate it's use as do the pocket compacts. If you ever owned an Agfa Silette, Kodak Retinette 35mm compact, or even an original PEN you'll  love this little Olympus gem.|#|I've not found one, nor do I expect to, I love this new PEN series.

9.0|#|Very Light, and portable. Easy to use and the add on electronic viewfinder is very useful for angled shots.|#|The standard kit zoom lens doesn't allow for polarising filters as the lens barrel rotates when focusing.
10.0|#|I am not a photographer, but this camera is very portable and foolproof to use. The pictures are more than good enough for my website and advertising in general, but I cannot claim to be able to judge quality above that. The only reason I was not 10/10 for Image quality and Features is that I don't know. It does everything I want and I couldn't be happier. The auto function is better than I'll ever be. I do not want to become a camera buff, I want good pictures with a minimum of fuss and knowledge. This seems to do the trick for me.|#|Slow release in Europe. Limited range of lenses(though this is improving) I guess you can't use the electronic view-finder and flash simultaneously. I have never wanted to.

9.0|#|Very compact camera which takes great photos in almost any circumstances, uses AA batteries so very compatible with all your other electronics.|#|Limited optical zoom due to compact nature of camera


9.0|#|The twin lense kit for anyone new to the world of DSLR is brilliant as it starts you off being able to experiment with the different abilities of different lenses. Bright LCD screen and easy-to-use menu for navigating the multiple settings. The camera offers all of the same automatic features as are on a regular Olympus compact (based on Olympus FE230) plus the more sophistacated manual options you would expect to find with a DSLR.|#|It not easy to find fault with this camera kit. There are only two points. 1) Grip on the camera's body is a little bit awkward, making it difficult to hold it for a long time. However, the camera is very light-weight in relativity to other DSLRs, and the strap makes it comfortable when walking around. 2) I cannot, as of yet, find out how to put the autofocus off, which is a little bit annoying. But, seeing as these are the only faults i can pick out, it really is very good!

8.0|#|A very nice, compact camera. Very good quality photos.|#|Not so easy to understand as my previous Olympus

9.0|#|Size. Excellent range of features. Easy and intuitive operation. Almost faultless and quick autofocus. New 'gradation mode' makes a real difference to wide contrast ranges such as in landscapes. Noise levels are very low and subtle. Auto white ballance is excellent outdoors (not tested indoors yet). Improved processing makes for more saturated and natural colours. The vivid setting is only needed when conditions mean colours could do with a boost eg flat dull light. Nothing on the market can touch it at this price.|#|Small viewfinder, but you do get used to it. Diopter range too low. Very short-sighted users may need additional correction. LCD screen resolution could be better. Olympus tend towards a softer look to images, which is not to everyone's taste. Increasing sharpness by one step makes images look sharper with no aparent increase in noise or artifacts. Very susceptible to UV, so a 'haze filter' is a must. The omission of optical image stabalization may put some people off. All very minor gripes.

9.0|#|It's very easy to use! For me as a relative beginner it was very easy to learn all the features logically and systematically. It has a great display, and all the features are just really user-friendly and make you enjoy using it.|#|I didn't realise when I bought it that I was going to have to buy either a) new unrechargeable batteries every time I used it or b) an expensive rechargeable battery to avoid scenario (a). Also, the picture quality is sometimes quite poor, especially when shooting in low light. But that could also be down to my inexperience...

10.0|#|light weight ,nice screen.|#|menue is not like the other camera that i have.





8.0|#||#|10.	Price.  There are cheaper options that will suit many photographers.  For those who want an everyday camera with all (or most) of the creative control of a DSLR then the E-P3 is worth serious consideration.  If you're upgrading from a point-and-shoot and just want better image quality then the high price will be harder to justify.  As a second camera for DSLR shooters you are making a considerable investment in a second camera system.  But equally for these people there will be an expectation of build quality, handling, creative control and image quality that never comes cheap
9.0|#|I had to write this one because my PEN e-P3 exceeded my expectations--which doesn't happen very often. First, this camera is like a Faberge jewel. It is beautifully crafted with great attention to detail. Of course it would be worthless if it was only eye candy. I was expecting to have to shoot RAW files, but the out of camera JPEGS are amazing. Plus if you want to fine tune the JPEG the settings allow you two tweak them to suit your sensibility. ISO up to 1600 looks terrific and if you are in a jam the higher ISOs are useable. The OLED viewfinder is iPhone quality gorgeous. And while I thought the touchscreen interface was a feature that I wouldn't use, it is thoughtfully configured and more importantly responsive. Most reviews rave about the lightening fast focus...and I agree. There' s a little hunting and pecking at incredibly low light levels but manual focusing is easy. I am crazy happy with my PEN. I spent months doing research and I am so glad I chose this over DSLRs. You will not be disappointed!|#|
9.0|#|Excellent quality of photography, with a lot of possibilities to give free rein to the creativity.|#|Not exactly bad point; but the use is not easy because it's necessary to study the manual carefully to operate well all to know all the possibilities of the camera, if we want to make the most. But I think it's the same with any good camera.
9.0|#|Still have not learned all the features of this camera however what I do know is that my Nikon is headed for the drawer except on very special occasions. This camera does it all and is just so portable.|#|Menus are not always intuitive and it takes some digging to get a handle on them
10.0|#|Excellent piece of kit. Auto focus is fantastically quick.|#|Price?
8.0|#|Look and feel is high quality and feature rich. Photos are, as you might expect, stunning. The accompanying Olympus Viewer software is excellent.|#|The Instruction Manual is Ok as far as it goes, but it needs some additional explanations.
9.0|#|All the control you could hope for.|#|
9.0|#|Beautifully made, versatile and full spec. Excellent screen makes using functions such as Art filters a breeze. Image quality andAF performance xcellent. A joy to use|#|Some menu operations a bit confusing. Could have made more use of the touchscreen. Not cheap

9.0|#|Brilliant price for this fabulous camera. Not quite the picture quality of my old Nikon DSLR, but far more portable. I'm quite impressed.|#|You have to 'unlock' the lens every time you switch on which is a wee bit of a nuisance, but nothing major.
9.0|#|Small and lightweight. Excellent image quality - for stillls and movies. Great selection of lenses and accessories available. Very good low light capability. Dedicated movie button.|#|Would prefer articulated screen to move sideways as well. Wish there were more than one accessory point - eg for viewfinder AND mike. Screen size great for movie mode but only uses centre part for stills so quite small.
9.0|#|retro look but with modern features and the white finish I opted for literally finished the total image for me. well done Olympus|#|nothing at the front and what with the white gloss finish I went for, it is a little tricky to hold
8.0|#|Good picture quality|#|
9.0|#|Compact, excellent low light performance and all round picture quality compared to compact cameras of a similar size. Great to be able to take photos without a flash. The olympus 45mm f1.8 lens makes this a fantastic portrait camera, lovely bokeh.|#|would have been nice for the screen to tilt horizontally as well as vertically, but not really an issue.

9.0|#|Very good image quality for this kind of camera (waterproof compact)|#|Panoramic function is not very good: their is often some wrong image adjustment
8.0|#|On the whole it is a nice solid looking chunky camera.  The lens is centrally place so your fingers can never get in the way.  It comes with a strong strap.  The software supplied takes care of picture management once uploaded (though looks dated).  I'm sure this camera would survive a bit of rough, but personally I'm not going to extremes.|#|The oblong plastic surround, around the lens looks a little fragile.  There is a removable ring around the lens which can be removed for lens accessories however I do not see many people using this feature and this part of the camera can hold tiny amounts of water as the ring compartment is not water resistant.  The plastic cover for the monitor screen at the back of the camera is probably better than toughened glass as it would give on impact.  As with all camera monitors in bright light, one can only uses it as a guide.
9.0|#|Excellent compact camera that produces both good images in normal environments and under water.  This camera also produces some very good special effects, that once again are nice and simple to use and get good results from.  Nice size, and can easily be put in your pocket.|#|The Mode wheel is a little fiddly to use, and the grip can be tricky under water.

8.0|#|I was looking for a next step up from my semi-SLR and something that was not too heavy on my wrists.  This olympus fit my specs and more.  It's supposedly olympus's lightest weight slr.  My previous camera was an olympus so finding my way around the buttons and functions was pretty intuitive.  Nothing so far has annoyed me yet but I've only had it a few days.|#|Not really a bad point as such, but it doesn't take the same type of lithium battery as my old camera or my brother's E30 so it's going to be annoying to have to buy new spares.  The charger is also huge relative to the battery which will make it annoying to carry round.
10.0|#|The camera offers a wide range of 23 different shooting modes (portrait, landscape, close-up, night shooting, etc) and automatic exposure which will be of great use to the beginner, whilst the options of aperture priority, shutter priority and fully-manual exposure will not restrict the more accomplished user. There is also an optional choice of 7 different art filters such as soft-focus to help create special moods without using image processing software. The more serious photographer will also appreciate the auto-focus options available. The 12.3 megapixels make for high-definition, quality photographs. The camera comes packaged with battery and charger, USB and Video cables, shoulder strap and Olympus Image Processing software for easy download and editing on a laptop or PC, and a comprehensive, well-written and easy-to-use instruction manual. Price-wise the whole package and the spec of the camera compare extremely favourably with anything else available. I have enjoyed using Olympus SLR and DSLR cameras for many years and this is as fine a camera as they have produced.|#|Like any DSLR, the range of facilities and functions available may be rather daunting to the absolute beginner and for that reason I would hesitate to recommend this camera for a complete novice. However for anyone who has used SLRs or DSLRs before, or anyone wising to step up from top-end fixed-lens zoom digitals I could not think of any bad points to warn about.

9.0|#|high quality of pictures and easy to use.|#|The main bad point is that when taking photo's on bright sunny days, it is hard to see the image in the display as the image of my face is reflected in the display.  This is the first camera I have had that does not have a view finder as well as a display screen.
10.0|#|Very easy to use, first time I have had a digital camera without a view finder; the screen is so large that it is easily manageable. Coming with a case was a plus. All in all a very good purchase.|#|

9.0|#|not used it to its fullest yet but so far so good|#|would have preferred to have handbook to browse through instead of pc disc. viewfinder would be advantageous when its really sunny as its difficult to see the screen

8.0|#|You know images are going to be top notch.|#|Default image settings can be improved upon which needs fiddling.
9.0|#|Pretty much everything about C8080 is excellent.|#|Location of the on/off switch. I can't count the amount of times I have turned the camera off, whilst reaching for the shutter button ! - However this is a small price to pay for such a great camera.

8.0|#|Easy to use|#|none recognised so far
7.0|#|Easy to start up and use|#|Olympus software is NOT user friendly and i no longer use it. I choose Fuji Finepix software as this is very easy to use.
8.0|#|versatile LCD screen, logical control layout, easy access menus (though large, downloadable instruction manual).  Good auto performance, but also great for manual photography, experimenting with effects etc.|#|Limited max optical zoom.  Barrelling at extreme wide angle (but good wide angle range compared to most digicams).  Large lens necessitates a lens cap rather than an integral lens cover.
9.0|#|Very compact for its features, excellent spec, seems to do all the things it says it does.|#|No detailed guide included, the online guide of over 100 pages not good for access so hard to use properly away from a computer whist you are learning. The brief guide provided is very basic.

8.0|#|This camera was bought as an Xmas present for my mother who finds it very easy to use both taking and downloading pictures|#|Dislike the battery compartment cover which is not always easy to replace if access to the memory card is needed. Otherwise no bad points as yet.
10.0|#|Given as a present ,told that the camera worked exceptionally well.|#|Should have been informed that the camera will only hold a few photos,I then had to purchase a picture card.

8.0|#|It has a wide range of features, and is flexible in allowing the user the choice of a high level of input or allowing the camera to run the show|#|The User Interface is not particularly intutitive and takes a bit of getting used to



9.0|#|lens weatherproofed, great for travel, perfect size, solid build, easy access to functions via buttons, a much more pleasant experience than my Canon 5D, excellent results out of the camera without endless hours in Photoshop.|#|None bad - some of the Olympus accessories are expensive
10.0|#|Extremely fast focusing|#|A bit stiff - probably down to newness


9.0|#|digital SLR, particularly the E420 as it was the best on the market. I was pleased to find that it could be used like a manually operated film camera where you decide on the aperture, shutter speed etc, or you could go into automatic mode with its 18 different scene modes. It is light and compact and even though I have large hands its small size is not a problem as far as operating it is concerned.  The back up instructions of both DVD and manual are easily understood|#|I haven't come across any yet as far as the camera is concerned.  However the manual although instructive and relatively easily understood could have been better set out e.g after the first eight pages describing with diagrams the camera, the mode dial, the viewfinder, super control panel etc it then instructs you to unpack the box contents! Then after a few pages on attaching the lens, loading the card, shooting etc, the Table of Contents follows!   Throughout the rest of the manual was the frustration of starting to read about, for example White Balance only to be directed elsewhere in the manual for the selection of such.  Why not put it all in the same place?  Maybe I'm being a little too pedantic but I did find myself getting increasingly annoyed as I tried to follow  specific aspects of operation through the manual.
10.0|#|Good picture quality.|#|However, film cassettes were not supplied with older SLR's, so that may be wishful thinking!

10.0|#|Once you have understood the various mode uses.|#|No user manual in book form, to use the user guide / Manual you need a computer which is not at hand when your using your camera.

9.0|#|feature which gives you an instant make-over and smooths out any blemishes!  That certainly comes in handy!|#|I was disappointed there was no photo card included in the box.  That is extra, although there is a stored memory function which enables you to take about 16 pictures, before it is full.  I need to go out and buy an Olympus memory card now which will be a minor inconvenience.

9.0|#|Feels good when you hold it. quick focus and shoot.|#|Some of the buttons are a bit fiddly.
9.0|#|Handling, viewfinder. HLD-4 Grip makes it feel solid, if a fraction weighty. The IS is essential.  Live view screen|#|Following the focusing instructions, this might just be this operator. Noisy shutter after E1.

9.0|#|Excellent camera, the accessories for it are great. I would like to see continuous automatic focus in live view but that is the only thing i would like to change. I love this camera and the twin lense kit is excellent value for money.|#|none

10.0|#|First time I've gone digi, and I'm delighted.|#|Too much on the camera for me to master in one sitting, but I'm sure I'll get there in the end!
9.0|#|SHOOT BUT HAS LOTS MORE FUNCTIONS IF YOU WANT.|#|NO CASE SUPPLIED
9.0|#|Looks like a compact but has the quality of a dslr|#|
10.0|#|I already owned an olympus e40 so found it fairly easy to navigate my way around.  The image quality is great.  The LCD monitor is great for taking shots at very low level because it is hinged and will pull out and twist.  Therefore you don`t have to lay on your stomach to see the picture you are taking.|#|The AF is slower when using the LCD monitor rather than the viewfinder.  I knew to expect this so can`t really complain.  Haven`t come across any other bad points.
9.0|#|Compact. Excellent results. Fits in perfectly with my other Olympus DSLR's.|#|None.

6.0|#|Easy to use, sturdy so won't break easily.|#|Battery life is poor, delay in picture being taken means that it makes anything that moves extremely difficult to take a shot of...a bit pointless!

10.0|#|This is a fantastic camera - and I have been thrilled with the purchase.  It takes great shots and it represents superb value for money.|#|You need to buy a good storage card - I bought a fast 2Gb card for about £40 and it's been a dream to use.  The camera does not come with a charger/rechargeable battery.  You can get these on eBay for £10! :)

10.0|#|Large number of menu items can be directly accessed via dedicated buttons.  I have been able to use my old high quality Olympus Film Camera Lenses via an adapter.  The standard lenses supplied are very compact and a large number of focal lengths can be accommodated with just the two standard zooms.|#|Right Hand grip could be larger for lengthy holding of the Camera and standard lenses should have metal surface to attach to the Camera for durability.  The JPEG highest quality setting was not easily found via the instruction manual.  I got there eventually however.
9.0|#|Size, handling and lens quality. My first digital SLR though I have used  film based units.|#|None to speak of.
1.0|#|The case itself is not bad quality, and does have some useful pockets|#|The camera that this is sold with doesnt fit in it!! Its totally the wrong case for a camera with any type of zoom lense...bought it as recommended by the website as I thought it would guarentee the exact case to protact the camera....so very very disappointed
