10.0|#|I am a complete novice so my opinion is more valuable for those looking for a DSLR.  It is so easy to use.  It also allows you to progress as you get more confident with the camera by also offering variable settings.  I use it for close-ups of my work (Food) and it never lets me down.  I use the photos for websites and magazine work and they are perfect!|#|None!
10.0|#||#|None that I gave found yet!
10.0|#|Very easy to use if your upgrading to your first entry level dslr camera very lightweight and easy to handle and takes  crisp clean shots this is the one to buy . once you learn the basics of the menu screen which is showed in the manual its very easy to use in auto or to adjust to useing manual settings which iv learnt to use with the help guide which is programmed in the camera as a extra so all in all worth every penny|#|Being picky only- its a shame nikon doesnt give the option to use AA batteries as an extra but no real faultsto be given really
8.0|#|Very easy to use. It's light weight makes it very comfortable to carry around the neck. Smaller than traditional DSLR's, so it's not so cumbersome. It has all the basic features that you would expect from an entry level DSLR but a whole lot of extra's that really do make this camera fun and exciting to use. Very good battery life, even when using a telephoto lens all day.|#|I haven't found any yet with the camera itself but I bought the WiFi adapter for it only to find that it is only supported by Android, so I can't use my iPad to wirelessly stream the photos from the camera to the iPad. I believe that iPad support is coming soon.
9.0|#|This is a great SLR compact light and wasy to use the guide mode is very helpful and talks u threw diffrent settings the manual mode lets u use the flash anytime were as the other modes dont but the image is so sharp and detailed its fantastic|#|The lense isnt the best its quite basic which means you do have to invest it a larger lense if you want to be able to zoom in etc but not an imediate problem
10.0|#|Excellent SLR, good image quality, good spec.|#|Can't use older Nikon lenses.
10.0|#|Camera is easy to use, having had little experience of this type of camera. Quick to set up and intuitive to use. Great results are easily achieved and the menus etc are straight-forward.|#|None as yet.
9.0|#|easy to carry around, when you are out shooting pictures. The built-in Menu / help guide is such a great feature to have, which I believe all Nikons have. If you are a starter with DSLR Camera's, then the Nikon D3200 is for you.|#|None to date
10.0|#|Easy to use, capable of wide range of photographer from 'point and shoot' to professional quality. Top quality camera.|#|A directional LCD screen would be a great addition rather than the static.

9.0|#|The D3200 now has the very compact VR II lens that comes with the D3300, making it a great camera for the price.|#|
8.0|#|The value was great for money for both the body and lenses as a deal and considering the £50 cashback Nikon was offering, but that being said, that is only so because the new D3300 is being released and electronic products are bound to get cheaper as they get older. Not a problem for me, though. I don't care about having the latest of the market, or upgrading things that frequently, so this is intended to last me for years.|#|
10.0|#|The ease of use is amazing, for a very complicated professional looking camera it is simple to use. The users manual should be read thro' first, as I am a beginner this was a good help. There are many accessories  for this camera which is handy but should be looked at for need.|#|Can't find any bad points yet.

9.0|#|Bought the D3200 as my first dslr from other reviews I had read. I'm not disappointed. Image quality is really good, camera is not to big or heavy to carry around. I shoot everything in M mode so haven't tried all the other features. But would definitely recommend this to others who are new to dslr cameras.|#|I'm sure more experienced photographers would find bad points but none from me.
9.0|#|Easy for a novice like myself to use.  Straight forward controls and instant pictures.|#|I need to buy a bigger zoom to get better long distance shots.  Not a fault of the camera but my eagerness to get shooting!
9.0|#|Great for beginners, easy to use|#|A bit expensive
9.0|#|Easy to use and understand, if you have used a DSLR before|#|Should have a memory card included.  You would not buy a car without an engine would you!?
10.0|#|Fantastic package, great quality pictures,a lot of camera for the money. Invest in the extra lens's well worth it. This is described as an entry level slr but with the quality of the camera, the pictures and its usability you might never need to upgrade|#|You might find the dummys guide ti the nikon d3200 useful if you've never had this type of camera before. There are lots if settings to get ti grips with but patience will pay off

10.0|#|To many to list here.|#|None really, except I could I done with 2 lenses included instead of just the one.
8.0|#|Image quality is good and you have access to plenty of settings to make your perfect shot. I have used this camera to take pictures of my family mainly action shots and it copes with these very well. Battery life is also very good.|#|Doesn't have two wheels to adjust shot settings- some other Nikons have this for ease of use so it's a little fiddly to adjust settings while you are shooting an image. You would probably get used to this after a while though so not really something to stop you from buying.
9.0|#|Very good as first SLR camera. Still need to spend time reading and trying out different program's. but my photos so far have been amazing.|#|Really do need a second battery pack with it as battery runs out a bit quick.
9.0|#|The breathtaking quality of the images is the real trump card. And the huge MP count means you can zoom and crop without losing quality. Build quality is rock solid. The range of shooting options is impressive; the Guide mode is a great idea. The battery lasts basically for ever.|#|The user guide could be a bit more in-depth.
9.0|#|very useful, great picture quality, fast response.|#|
8.0|#|good preset modes for differing scenarios|#|will take some time to work out all the modes and effects
8.0|#|It is very easy to use|#|The battery life
9.0|#|The camera is great...|#|... BUT there is supposed to be £45 cash back on its way from Nikon, and nearly a month later NO SIGN OF IT. The actual process of applying for the cash back was a bit of a pain too. Hence the '6' for Value for Money.
10.0|#|To be honest I'm a complete novice and this is my first DSLR camera so I have nothing to really compare it with. I will say it's light and relatively easy to use with a ton of features. I especially like the guide mode which offers suggestions when your about to take a shot. In all I'd say if you've new to photography like myself, then this camera will get you off to a great start.|#|None
10.0|#|As a complete novice using this type of camera it has been fantastic I have taken over 400 shots with it mainly using the S mode for taking moving pictures of my doves in flight.

10.0|#|This was my first DSLR and it was super easy to set up and start using. I don't think I've really used it to its full potential, yet, so I'm looking forward to the opportunity to do that.|#|
10.0|#|Takes amazing photos. I went out for the day taking photographs in London and you can easily see the difference compared to using a standard camera or camera phone. It also takes fantastic night photos as long as you keep the camera still. Video quality is HD and it picks up sound great. It also has a mic jack so you could make the sound quality even better for videos if you wanted to. A great DSLR beginner/intermediate camera with a guide built in. Lens that comes with the camera is a high quality 18-55mm VR2 lens which is between £120-£200 alone depending on where you buy it. Also get £20 Nikon cashback.|#|I do like written guides or manual so having one would have been nice but there is a built-in guide. Nikon cashback was slightly annoying as you had to fill in an online application form and photocopy numerous documents and have them in a particular file type or you wouldn't get cashback. I did get cashback but just found the process a bit lengthy.

I did a great deal of comparisons with other DSLR's in the end the total package and the incredible 24MP swung it for me.|#|No negatives but I would recommend buying a second battery, you can easily shoot 2-300 shots in sports mode.

9.0|#|The bundled kit lens is very versatile. The pictures and video quality are very good.|#|A basic case (even a cloth one) would've been a nice inclusion into the kit. As would a basic SD card. Nothing a trip to Tesco can't fix though, and I'm nit-picking. This isn't just a great bit of kit for the money, it's a great bit of kit full stop.
10.0|#|IT'S RED!!!!   No, seriously, this is the first camera of this type I have ever had, and so I am a bit of a novice, but it was bought for me by my husband for Christmas and he is very knowledgeable about cameras, and so that is almost recommendation enough!  I wanted a camera of my own that I could learn to improve my skills with, and I am certain that this can be done with all the features this camera has, and I am looking forward to experimenting with it.  The fact that it comes in red too?  Well, that's a fun bonus in my books as a lover of that colour, but I have to say the camera looks pretty sharp in that colour, and it stands out against all the usual black equipment.  Definitely a camera worth owning as far as I am concerned!   :D|#|

This camera was very reasonable in price and is allowing me to explore different technical skills.  The camera still has auto and preset function modes to fall back on.|#|The accompanying Nikon software (View NX2) supplied on a cd wouldn't install on Windows 8.1 which I guess is because this is a slightly older Camera model.

9.0|#|The image quality is amazing. This is a pretty hefty upgrade from a D90 but so far, and I've only had it a couple of weeks, I am very impressed. Some of the functions are obviously very familiar and there are a few extras to try out. The time lapse facility is pretty neat and I've experimented a little bit. Coupled it with a SIGMA 105mm macro and well impressed with the results.|#|The WIFI app doesn't function with my Samsung galaxy. The 1/3 crop mode is hidden away in the menus as is the wifi connectivity, something that I feel should be a bit more obvious.

10.0|#|I recommend it.|#|Also, I would like to be able to switch between the histogram view and review shots on the LCD as easily as on my D80,- so far as I can see at present it is necessary to go into the menu to change them. Also, I may not have found it yet, but I really miss the review feature that flashed overexposed sections of the shot on and off on the LCD. No longer so necessary, but still useful as a very quick check if everything is OK.

9.0|#|A very good camera all round, if a bit complicated to begin with.|#|No dislikes at all.
9.0|#|Extra crop senser setting allowing for 2 times increased reach means 300mm lense acts like 600mm but lowers the shot from 24 mp to 18mp|#|
9.0|#|This is an upgrade from a D3100 - which I still have and use as it is a great camera - and I am not disappointed at all.  The massive number of options may seem daunting at first but stick with it and you will not regret having this camera.  All the negatives in reviews go on about video options, touch screen and swivel screens.  All very nice from a camera, but main point is to take photographs.  Not had a camera screen you can see in bright sunlight so much prefer using the viewfinder that is why I have an SLR.  Video - but I want a stills camera if you want to take video then buy a video camera.  Free battery grip and 3rd party battery then just keep pressing that shutter release and enjoy.|#|Not found anything yet.
10.0|#|The D7200 is a great camera, there is really nothing I can fault. As well as the published specs, the camera handles really well and Nikon has thought about everything.|#|The WMU ios app which interfaces with the camera is good but a bit basic.

10.0|#|FX image size is amazing but undeniably helped by having my Nikkor 50mm 1.14 G which I had for my Nikon D90 and had failed to realise, also worked on FX lenses.  Having the wider field of view has suddenly made that my always on lens - previously it was my 28-200.  Portraits are now less cropped but with the wonderfully narrow depth of field that I always loved with this lens.  Am so enthralled with it that I've barely used the new 28-300 lens but very happy with the results so far.  What an incredible camera and what an upgrade from the Nikon D90.  So glad I didn't opt for the D800.|#|None whatsoever but could they have mismanaged the D600 issue any more than they did?  Enough for me too to delay the FX purchase and consider all other alternatives.  Very disappointing.
10.0|#|As someone who already uses Nikon D700's and D3s' professionally, I know how good the image quality is, but the D610 is even better. The image quality is amazing! Being so used to the solidness of the D3s I was a bit worried that the D610 may feel a bit less robust, but I needn't have worried, with the addition of the battery grip it's a pretty solid camera and sits nicely in your hand.|#|None so far.

10.0|#|A  definite improvement over the D800, group area AF is great, MUCH quieter shutter, larger buffer but one of the best improvements is to live view|#|Not a bad point but even though it has the same AF system as the D4s, don't expect quite the same performance (i.e. number of in-focus keepers at high frame-rates) as the FPS also plays a large part in the system.

10.0|#|The quality of the images from this camera are great. The size of the files are large and so contain a great deal of information so allowing for very high quality large prints as well as cropping. The shutter is much quieter than the D800. The number of frames per second has increased slightly - a benefit for wildlife photographers.|#|
10.0|#|Fabulous image quality, fast and robust.|#|Focus mode button is in a silly place and operates in a silly direction.
10.0|#|It's a Pro grade cam.. You don't need to read the good points here. You would possibly know it if you are buying it.|#|Rubber grips would soon come apart as I am heavy duty all weather user. Cheap flimsy rubber grips. Same happened on D700.
10.0|#|Solid metal body, positive shutter release and good hand grip. Feels like quality and takes quality photographs. I have used the D800 and still have one. The D810 is not perfect, no camera is, but it addresses the niggles of what was already very good camera.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|New focus system|#|Price was a little high
10.0|#|Future proof.|#|Bad or not, the built in microphone picks up noise from zoom and focusing. Easily solved by an external microphone.
9.0|#|Ergonomically excellent, grips better than the D700, especially when the battery grip is added. Image quality is superb.|#|Eats storage cards due to large file sizes although these can be adjusted dependant on your requirements. Price is an issue, althoughi believe its worth it many would go for the new D750 over the D810.
9.0|#|Handling is much the same as other pro level Nikon's. Detail is truly stunning and the ISO performance is at least as good as my old D3, and probably a little better. Colour rendition seems excellent and the focussing accurate and faster than my D4. Shutter release is much quieter than my D4. A real revelation in fact.|#|I would prefer the ISO button to be on the back (long-standing gripe from D300 days) because it's hard to adjust when you have the camera up to your face. Also I wish you could have the in-viewfinder horizon level permanently on. Otherwise, I'm really happy with the D810 and would recommend it strongly to anyone as a general workhorse for most purposes.

9.0|#||#|-No low pass filter results in noise being visible at lower ISO settings than in cameras with one (from 400 up), but for me I'd rather have sharper shots, so is a compromise I am happy with
9.0|#|A worthwhile upgrade from my D7000. ISO performance and noise is improved and the ability to crop more is great. The new focus system is also much better and probably worth buying the D7100 for that alone. The best DX camera around at the moment.|#|Nikon pricing - as usual...
10.0|#|10/10 - Upgrading from a D90 this model is way ahead.  I'm extremely pleased with it but have a lot of learning to do with is many new/upgraded features.|#|Nothing yet, I've only have it 2weeks.
10.0|#|A big step up from the D5100. Ability to enlarge (crop) greatly whilst maintaining image quality. Bright viewfinder. Autofocuses with my AF (screw drive) lenses, works manually with my Ai lenses. Hardly any post processing needed, just sharpening - the colours are beautiful straight from the camera. Does not blow out the highlights like my D3100 and D5100 sometimes did. Everything is good about this camera. - I doubt if anything is better without going full frame.|#|Nothing at all -I don't want to nit pick for the sake of it.
10.0|#|Having had a D7000 it was an easy step moving to the D7100, crop factor useful for bird and moon shots greater range of focus points good feature, wireless dongle also usefull.|#|None so far

8.0|#|Excellent image quality!  I like the 5 exposure bracketing and the mirror-up functions.  Build quality seems good, personally, I think my D90 feels more solid.  On the whole a good camera.|#|Had 2 D7100's.  Unfortunately, the two cameras suffered from specks of dust within the viewfinder and oil splatter on the sensor (similar to the issues with some D600 cameras). Canon have acknowledged this issue with one of their top-end models but Nikon sadly seem to be ignoring it.
10.0|#|I went from the Canon S100 which is an amazing high quality compact camera which is almost DSLR in a compact body to the D7100. Initially it was rather daunting with all the options but after a week of playing with it I am making most of the camera. Bare in mind I am still new at photography I can comfortably change the aperture and shutter speeds to suit situations as well as quickly switch to macro for those insect moments. As far as a camera body goes I give this 10/10, I do not know how it could be improved, but the best performance is going to have to be the glass, decent glass on a medium camera will always take better pictures than rubbish glass on a better body so make sure you get a good (prime) lens on this body and you will be laughing. A camera capable of professional photography for under a grand, .... Bargain !|#|Hmm how to be negative about the D7100 ... Well it would have been nice if the camera came with a bag for protection, it would have also been nice if the screen would have come with a screen protector and even a simple brush for the lens wouldn't have added much cost, but none of these negatives are about the camera itself. It does HDR, it's remote control, etc etc etc, there isn't a feature missing that I wanted, am sorry I just cannot find a fault lol.

Nice range of Scene settings - I know it's cheating, but sometimes you need a quick fix be able to catch what's going on. It's a real bonus to use all my existing lenses, which is where the real investment lies in the long term.|#|Difficult to criticise for the money.
10.0|#|It has everything one could want apart from an articulated screen|#|perfection would be an articulated screen
9.0|#|Great handling, feels responsive in use. Loads of features and importantly most of them seem easily accessible. Having 24mp to play with is great (I've moved up from a 6mp D50)|#|First impressions are that the images are slightly soft (which seems surprising given the removal of the OLPF), although this is based on JPEG at highest setting (I've yet to try RAW)
10.0|#|briliant camera|#|non
8.0|#|the 1.3 crop will suit many ppl. Lower pixel count but still usable.|#|Slow! Very small buffer. Not good for sports.
9.0|#|Did a lot of research for cameras within my budget and the D7100 had a lot of good reviews. shopped around for the best value for body only including some freebies. As a Nikon D80 owner, the D7100 felt familiar though there is a LOT more to it and it took me a day to read the instructions to adjust the settings to my preference. Quality looks really good so far though of course this is in conjunction with any lenses. Can't wait to really put this through it's paces and add to it.|#|The camera is expensive but it's a serious bit of kit and there is a lot to understand and set up but that's why i bought it. Nothing bad so far, very happy.

10.0|#|Built like a tank, fantastic image quality,one of the best auto focusing systems on any dslr curently available, i like the dual card slots [compact flash, sdhc] the camera handles like a dream, nikon has now introduced the D7000, the D300s has a much better specifaction, ie: 51 point autofocus, against 39, on the 7000, the full camera built in full magnesium alloy body, the 7000 has just the front and back covers built this way, ok, the movie mode on the 7000 is better, but if like me, you buy a DSLR to take pictures, it;s got to be, the nikon D300s, a fantastic camera.|#|I cant find any, it was a bit expensive, but prices have recently dropped
10.0|#|I chose this camera as an upgrade to my old and trusty Nikon D70 that had served me well in nearly 20,000 images. The difference between the D300s and the D70 are quite marked. The D300s excels in low light were the D70 would have struggled. All the major functions of the D300s can be changed having to enter the menus and the info button allows even more flexibility in changing menu items. The image quality is superb and the large screen makes reviewing images an easy task. I do more motorsport and nature photography and the D300s is excellent for both.|#|None! Well maybe the depth and complexity of menus but you soon get used to them :)

9.0|#|Very easy to set up ' Out of the box '.|#|Don't think I'll use the video camera part much. But it's a ' nice to have ' option.
10.0|#|The Nikon D300s is a great camera, a little heavy if you are not not use to a DSL in this PRO class. Streets ahead from the D200 producing perfect pictures every time. I think you would only want to do video when the camera is mounted on a tripod as focusing when in hand held mode can produce very jumpy footage.|#|none
10.0|#|Excellent build quality providing versatility and quality images.  Upgraded from a D90 so lots to learn.  Taking it to the Malaysian Rainforest next week so it will be put through its paces!|#|Cant think of any to be honest.  People complain about how heavy it is but if I am honest, for something of this build quality its what I would expect.
10.0|#|For me the 51 point Af, Magnesium alloy body, Build quality, weather seals, 7fps, Low light performance, Image quality and Ergonomics. Looked at this camera and the canon eos 7d, but would buy this camera again if had the chance. Very satisfied, excellent quality camera as you would expect from Nikon. Big step up from my D90!|#|Video feature not great but didn't buy for video, bought for excellent still images camera produces. If you want video buy a dedicated video camera.

I particularly like the self clean sensor and the fact it is compatible with the rest of my Nikon gear.|#|None really it is a good all round camera but if I had to make a criticism it would be that the live view is a little bit fiddly to use, but I am sure as I get used to it I shall find it a valuable addition to have to a great camera.

9.0|#||#|should have come with a second battery, at this level . All should have been remote, any way thats all really
9.0|#|Amazing image quality and so much technology on board.|#|None really, it will take a while to learn it all though!
10.0|#||#|Some of the photo editing software with the camera could have more features and any easier method of zooming in on the photo for post production editing.
10.0|#|Great build quality that you expect from Nikon.|#|And the shutter release is a little loud for my liking - again a typical trait for Nikon DSLRs - would love to see a more quiet shutter release mode.
9.0|#|Features, ease of use, build quality|#|noise on high ISO
10.0|#|88mm -- 300mm lenses|#|should be sold with memory cards, otherwise the you are paying another hundred pounds for memory
9.0|#|Build quality excellent. The camera and lens survived a 4 feet drop to the pavement with little damage.|#|Camera strap came off the camera , either because I fitted the strap wrongly or the design allowed it to happen. The camera and lens survived with minimal damage. I will be fitting the strap from my rather elderly Pentax Spotmatic to the D300S.
10.0|#|Pro spec camera. Better built than teh D7000 which I was also considering|#|Somne of the sub menus are hard to find.
10.0|#|Ease of use It's fantastic if you know what you are doing... after all it is a Professional DSLR so, there is no Idiot mode... I have one and I love it!! highly recommend it!|#|Can't think of any....

10.0|#|Build quality is excellent. Gives the camera a real pro feel. I was toying with the idea of getting the d7000 but I'm glad I got the d300s as I won't need to upgrade for a good few years.|#|None, well except the fact that it's such a good camera it's a bit too good for my level but after a few lessons and a few good reads of the manual I soon got the hang of it.
10.0|#|Very good value for money.|#|None
10.0|#|Excellent camera, the best for Price before you can afford FX camera.|#|LO ISO , must be 100, - poor video, but who use video in DSLR camera ?? if you want video by video camcorder
9.0|#|Simply a quality. Intuitive  product.  Photographs are great quality ESP at high iso.|#|not found any yet!!
10.0|#|The good thing is you have two memory cards which you can use how you what. Realy good images|#|
10.0|#|Great photos. Fast action. Good sturdy camera will take a knock or two.  2 memory cards so great storage.|#|Would have like an image starighten function, as per my old D90 - or an electronic spirit level in the view finder. The LV one is good.
9.0|#|Wifi makes it easier to send pictures almost anywhere.|#|Battery doesn't seem to last long.
9.0|#|Very good camera. Not really an introductory or beginners camera, but Nikon don't label it as such. Solid and fairly easy to use; the Live screen feature is a real plus. Well worth the money, with very good picture quality.|#|No real gripes with the camera. The Live screen takes a little getting used to if you choose not to use the viewfinder - but the benefits of it far outweigh any downside
9.0|#|The wifi option is great|#|
10.0|#|light and easy to use|#|none that I can find
10.0|#|Pretty easy to use for a beginner and a good step up from a point n click.|#|As with all cameras, no extras supplied, not even a memory card.
10.0|#|First dslr I hv owned,fantastic camera and easy to use|#|None

9.0|#|Superb picture quality. Straightforward to use|#|No
9.0|#|Easy to take initial pictures on the auto settings which produce excellent results.  Have used telephoto lens 70-300mm with excellent results as well.  Taking time to get to grips with the other settings but I am sure the results will be just as good.|#|None so far
10.0|#|Peace reviews but for me its great.|#|The user!!!!!!
9.0|#|Wonderful camera, not too bulky or heavy, excellent image quality, it takes some time to get used to all the buttons and functionalities, but when that is mastered the pistures are really great. Very good value for money considering this is one of the highest res camera you can find. I bought the body only and a different/better lens than the standard on offer. I had Nikon cameras over 2 decades and never regretted any Nikon purchase (while with other brands I did).|#|None really...
9.0|#||#|None Yet, not had time to put it to a field test
8.0|#|Very light, making it an perfect for travel.|#|Only AFS not AF lens compatible meaning I can't use some of my favourite lenses.
9.0|#|In many ways it is simply an upgraded D50 but the difference in quality is remarkable and so far I have found it to be superb. The reduction in weight is particularly noticeable and makes a huge difference. If it is half as good as the D50 then you will have bought a very able and reliable camera indeed.|#|None so far - nor am I expecting any.
10.0|#|As a professional I use this camera for certain specific things. Smallness is important to pack it, the fact I can use my other nikon lenses, the fact its easy to use without complicated instructions is critical. I use a range of cameras. My next shoot is in London, latex fashion at the end of september and I'm using this and an old Olympus with a superwide lens, because with the lenses and Photoshop CC's shake optimiser I can get pinsharp pictures. It was an excellent buy, and really very well priced.|#|
10.0|#|Cracking image quality great clarity|#|Historgrame does not show what shutter speed and Iso settings were used only white balance snd compensation plus and minus
9.0|#|Easy to set up and shoot, rapid auto-focus on moving subjects. So good that I now have two D3200 cameras.|#|Have not found any.

9.0|#|easy to use  with plenty of guidance|#|none
9.0|#|Outstanding Image quality|#|None
9.0|#|for novices. Focussing with Nikkor AF-S lenses is very rapid and virtually silent.|#|Strangely there is no display screen protector available from Nikon, nor is there an auxiliary battery grip [there are some 3rd party ones which connect via an external cable [which looks stupid and clumsy].

7.0|#|Very high (24.2) megapixels.|#|Pity that the battery and memory card has been changed and I cannot use those I bought for my my D60

9.0|#|Good price, excellent quality of photos.|#|It would be nice if it came in a bundle with other than the 18-55mm VR  Lens.
9.0|#|Great spec and good build quality|#|A little bit smaller than I was expecting
8.0|#|months of joy, discovering all the features especially scenes modes|#|just one slot for memory card
9.0|#|Excellent in low light|#|Non so far
9.0|#|Used with the AF-S DX Nikkor 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED VR II lens, the image quality is really great !!|#|A good SD card (class 10) is strongly advised but this is valid for any DSLR as well
9.0|#|Still accepts all my old Nikon lenses.|#|Some of my older lenses which auto focus on the D80 have to be manually focussed on the D5200. not a big problem but a bit of a surprise.
10.0|#|The camera is easy to use and the image is amazing! Worth the money!|#|None so far
9.0|#|Tiltable screen and image quality.|#|Shutter is ridiculously noisy - there is a setting in the menu to make it more quieter, but it is still loud.
10.0|#|excellent camera|#|none
9.0|#|Price|#|
9.0|#|combined with a Tamron 90mm macro lens, this camera gets some beautiful close up shots. The hd video setting with stereo sound is also a great feature.|#|Not many... The fact that it is not full frame means you have to be further away from objects to get more in, but you know this before you buy it, so not really a surprise.
9.0|#|works very well in almost all conditions, 24mpx is a gr8 bonus, its lighter than most and compact, without loss of quality. all in all agr8 little camera.|#|
9.0|#|flip out screen is very useful, very speedy to get the live image up.|#|easy to accidentally turn camera off when rapid shooting
10.0|#|interval timer|#|
8.0|#|Good feature set, and the camera is well reviewed.|#|Keep in mind that 55mm is the equivalent view from a 35mm lens with a full frame sensor camera, so the kit lens just gives you the wide angle capability.
1.0|#|Brian STEEL|#|Where is the Camera
10.0|#|Easy to use with clear instructions from the online manual|#|
7.0|#|High quality pics ,|#|Focus a bit slow, doesn't feel as substantial or we'll madeley as my old d90
10.0|#|Excellent features for the keen photographer.|#|Bit concerned about the viewing screen as it swivels to the side of the camera and was always concerned I would break it.  However, that said it focuses you on taking greater care of your camera
8.0|#|Great value for money.|#|No touchscreen, but do you really need one?
9.0|#|I thought the swing-out monitor screen was a gimmick until I tried some natural history shots with it. The device is SO useful for obtaining shots from awkward angles.|#|A package deal with an additional  55-200mm lens would have been helpful.
9.0|#|Great picture quality|#|
10.0|#|Lightwieght and compact to carry around.excellent image quality and ability to crop images due to the 24mp.articulated screen handy for low and high shots.|#|None so far
9.0|#|Very good viewfinder, plenty of information visible. RAW shooting, HD video. Rotating screen useful for low/high angle shots.|#|Relatively small body size (although this is a plus for some!) sd slot only, sometimes the auto-focussing can be slow when using live view monitor (compared to Sony alpha series live view)
10.0|#|Up to date features. Good, bright screen and viewfinder.|#|Perhaps there are too many features for a senior citizen.
9.0|#|Easy to use if you are a beginner but has full manual control for the advanced user if needed.|#|As an advanced user I would have preferred separate aperture and shutter controls but it so much cheaper than cameras that have that facility.
10.0|#|all controls are easy to hand via either individual buttons or menu.|#|I'm used to a Bridge type camera so needing to use the DSLR Live View to see some things when the bridge gave the same information constantly is mildly frustrating.
10.0|#|All is perfect|#|No cover included
10.0|#|Really thrilled with camera.  Still in the middle of playing around with all the features.  Decided to take the plunge and get another Nikon.  A replacement for my analogue Nikon.  Very happy customer!|#|Not yet!  Happy, happy, happy!!!!!

9.0|#|screen and nice simple controls. It's more bells and whistles than I'm ever likely to use but seems to have some fantastic features, just browsing through the massive users' manual.|#|The only thing I've found not to my liking so far is that the text for the date and time stamp is too big and is in a very obtrusive orange colour which distracts the viewer from the content of the photo. On my previous camera which this replaced the text was smaller and in an unobtrusive green. I'm disappointed that there's no way to reduce the size of the text or change the colour
9.0|#|neat compact good quality camera that does what it says in the write up.|#|the user manual is only on CD which means you either try and memorise 200+ pages of instruction or print your own manual that is a massive document whatever type of printer you use

6.0|#|Monitor is nice and clear.   There are a lot of features but need to get the online manual to learn to use them properly.|#|Flash unit very badly positioned - awkward to hold camera so as not to block unit popping up.   In fact, camera had to be replaced because flash unit was faulty from outset.   Also difficult to hold it as advised without moving camera when pressing button to take picture, causing a blurred result.   Camera goes into 'sleep' mode too quickly.

10.0|#|Upgraded from my D7000 and i was shocked how well this camera performs. Its an absolute monster. The layout from the 7000 series cameras to this one is almost identical so it knew how to control the camera right off the bat. I mainly use my 70-200 on it and occasionally i stick my 50mm on it and the performance of both is outstanding. I didnt bother with the kit lens so i just bought the body only but i am very very happy with this camera.|#|Quality glass will really make this camera shine. But quality glass = £££
9.0|#|Early days, but compared to my old D700: Great focusing and face recognition. Much lighter! Anything to help my back. The wifi is brilliant. Being able to tweet/Instagram as soon as I've taken the shot is a game changer. And although I prefer CF cards to SD, having two slots so I have instant backup is great for piece of mind.|#|Very few, but a couple of UI issues. Changing the iso is a pain. It would be great if you could hold down the Pv button and scroll to change the iso. Also you only have the choice of 1/2 or 1/3 stops, I liked having 1 stop (i.e. only 200,400,800,1600 etc..).
8.0|#|Image quality above ISO 10,000 is awesome! Dynamic Range for Landscapes is phenomenal. 1080 60p video looks great - having a Tilting screen is a handy feature. Weight is refreshing. Hand Grip - although it is narrow, it is nice and deep! Shooting speed is pretty decent. Auto Focus speed and accuracy is very good - not D4s good though!|#|Command Dial and Shooting function button feel cheap and nasty. Shutter Life of 150,000 - this makes this camera a Consumer model. Noise between ISO 1600 and 6400 displays lots of colour artifacts - which have detrimental effect on Portraiture shots - can be cleaned up though. Preview and Function buttons are in a stupid place - good if you are quadruple jointed. Focus points are clustered in the middle of frame - I have never understood this!
10.0|#|Superb camera! Image quality is about as good as it gets, dynamic range and ISO noise are amazing.  Auto focus is super fast and accurate even in very low light. Feels great to hold. Great LCD screen. Great menu. Loving my new camera.|#|It is expensive but what you get for the money is worth it.
9.0|#|Amazing-stepping (leaping) up from a D90. Using the same 50mm prime that used on the d90, the image quality is ridiculous. After 10 min, I set the ISO to auto and never worried about it again. Love it!|#|Weirdly the body feels so light, it gives the impression that it's a bit plasticky, but it's actually a really solid build.
10.0|#|This camera is fantastic and I'm glad I held out and didn't get the D610.  The D750 has a better body, better grip and better sensor.  I am getting crisp images using the Nikkor 50mm f1.8G lens.|#|The cost!  So far I have no bad points, it works amazingly well.
10.0|#|Excellent camera performance wise.|#|Need to ensure you use fast Sandisk cards to prevent write errors.
10.0|#|Lovely camera feels great in your hand (I have small hands too). The dynamic range is superb and the high iso capability is really impressive.|#|
9.0|#|Large file size too. Would definitely recommend. We're upgrading all our bodies to D750's now.|#|Haven't come across others at the mo as only had it a couple of weeks.

10.0|#|Quality product I'm enjoying getting to know it|#|

9.0|#|Wi-FI, tilting screen|#|Cant find any yet
10.0|#|Incredible high ISO pictures, fast auto-focus, lightweight.|#|Screen only flips up and down, doesn't fully articulate which isn't helpful when using it to take portraits.
10.0|#|Build looks sturdy and good quality. I would really recommend it as a step-up from any entry-level consumer dSLR.|#|A bit heavy, don't really know how it compares to it's competitors. Can't really complain about anything else.
9.0|#|Great focus points - Image quality - Build quality and 7fps in 1.3 crop is more than enough for wildlife photography on a 150-600m lens|#|WIFI transfer only works with IOS and Andriod not windows phones (no app) and no ability to connect direct to a laptop wireless without additional purchase of wireless transmitter.
10.0|#|Was a big step up from my old D5100, image quality is incredible.  Definitely a solid investment, there are plenty of reviews online to help with selection.|#|The price, but since its a relatively new model so it wasn't a huge surprise.
10.0|#|Even got a free battery grip, when combined the camera feels rugged and ready for a long days worth of shooting|#|Neck strap could do with being padded, the combined weight of the camera, lenses and battery grip is fairly heavy. it would just make use more comfortable over longer periods of time
10.0|#|A lot to learn about this camera when coming from D80. Good grip and nice photos, but read manual before getting upset and blame camera.|#|None so far
10.0|#|Awesome image quality, easy to use, nice build quality - it's a Nikon|#|No bad points encountered yet but a tilty touch screen would have made the D7200 perfect.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality, very good build quality|#|No camera RAW support for Adobe photoshop **yet**
9.0|#|The x30 zoom and its compact size|#|No
10.0|#|It is a specialist camera for taking telephoto pictures.  You need to use a steady tripod when using the lens at it fullest extent.  It is not just a point and shoot camera.|#|
9.0|#|Solid, good looking camera. Comfortable in the hand and the tilting viewing screen is a masterpiece.|#|Nothing I can think of
8.0|#|Nice camera, feels solid.|#|Takes a bit of getting used to as its easy to touch buttons by accident.
10.0|#|the wifi and gps|#|nothing
10.0|#|Built very tough, very fast and accurate. Battery life.|#|Need to use Nikon software to load .NEF files.
10.0|#|Since buying the camera it has given me shooting options that was never available before. Without a doubt its image quality, build quality, capabilities, flexibility and ease of use are second to none (except perhaps a D3s or D3x).|#|Heavy. After a whole day's shooting my right arm definitely feels the weight. Then again, it's not really much different from other pro level cameras.
10.0|#|Excellent build quality and endless end-user functionality.  Pro spec with pro results|#|None
9.0|#|Precision instrument for professional photographers|#|
10.0|#|Great camera especially if you're looking for a Pro model and are used to shooting on old film cameras - a definite nod to the days of past!|#|Bit of a learning curve regarding the feel and use of all the dials but that's the fun of getting something new, isn't it?
10.0|#|Fast and accurate, very few missed focus shots WB very good, ISO mind blowing.|#|Only thing going against it is the price should really be £4500
9.0|#|It has the look and feel of the old Leica's in terms of compactness, quality and portability. A true photographers camera who wants to have it around all the time, but wants real photos not snapshots.|#|
10.0|#|A pocket powerhouse of a camera.  I already have a Nikon P7100 but this is a very useful upgrade - it has a conventional lens cap, a fully tilting rear screen which also serves to protect the screen itself when closed, 1080 movies [rather than 720], HDR, panoramas and a filter thread.  When looked at on a laptop screen the image quality is as good as that of my DSLR [Nikon D7100].  I find that I am using the compact more often now than the SLR because it is so much lighter than the SLR and the latter's associated lenses - a case perhaps of carry less shoot more.  For non-specialist photography I think that anybody considering buying a DSLR should check out this compact camera.  I can find nothing to say against the camera.|#|None really, but a wrist strap [rather than a neck strap] would have been useful.
9.0|#|Even for novice photographers picture quality from automatic point and shoot settings is excellent, meaning I can learn the camera's more advanced features progressively in my own time.  That is not as difficult as it might seem thanks to the intuitive menus.|#|For this money the inclusion of a protective case would have been nice.
9.0|#|Viewfinder, multipositon screen.Ease of handling.|#|Would have liked security line on lens cap.
9.0|#|portable ease of use quality|#|expensive if you pay full price

10.0|#|Great camera which you simply cannot fault for the price!|#|None

9.0|#|Fantastic image quality and amazing ability to focus in low light. Glad I went for the higher price lens as this is providing greater flexibiity|#|This is a much more complicated camera to use than my other Nikon D5000. Its going to take me a while to get to grips with and learn. not really a bad point but worth noting.

8.0|#|Small easy to carry.|#|No
9.0|#|Liked the compact size but still have easy access to the main features that I use. Build quality is excellent and I expect this camera to last.|#|Control dial was stiff to turn when first used. However, I am more used to using it and it works just fine.
8.0|#|Wifi+mic|#|Settings scroller and shutter button feels a little cheap (controls on the top)
9.0|#||#|Feeling mislead over the WiFi feature - it is not for transferring HQ pictures, only previews it appears.  Other than that, an excellent camera.
9.0|#|Great auto focus, good grip giving a secure hold. Good to tilt screen.|#|Apart from that nothing at all.
10.0|#|Great piece of equipment and well worth the money. Although it would be relatively easy for a novice to use i.e. Has many automatic modes, the camera will really yield amazing results in the more professional or experienced hand.|#|
9.0|#|All round great camera|#|No lens hood - nikon penny pinching
10.0|#|I have only had the camera few weeks so this review is a little short on experience however, i am now married to the Nikon Brand and feel confident about using this camera.|#|Nothing so far....
9.0|#|Everything is fantastic about the camera|#|Manual is soooooo thick
10.0|#|Step up from the d3100, still has the easy learning curve, good for experienced photographer to handle.|#|Some controls are a bit fiddly as described on most review sites.
10.0|#|Not really in a position to fairly judge just yet as I haven't had a lot of opportunities to use the camera (I've only had it a week). That said, what playing I've done, I have found it very good. Nice feel, good size (I've got fairly big hands)  buttons and controls all fairly easy to use (once I work them all out lol). The lens has a nice quality feel to it with a fair bit of friction in the zoom (it doesn't just zoom in and out with a breath of air). All in all I am certain I will get every bit as much pleasure from this outfit as I did from it's predecessor (D70s with 18-70mm kit lens).|#|In all honesty I can't really criticize either the camera or the lens, especially as I've hardly used it.
9.0|#|Match with the dental needs|#|

9.0|#|Good versatile package. Easy to pick up, I was out taking photos within a few hours of getting the camera. Good range of accessories to go with it too.|#|Plastic used in the build is bubbled. Not really a problem but I like things to be smooth.
8.0|#|Quick, easy access to all your settings via display panel.|#|None found so far.
10.0|#|Having used a Canon D400 for a number of years I wanted a camera of my own as my wife now uses the Canon a lot of the time!   After much research (including Digital Camera Magazine, and Which Reports) I decided to buy the Nikon D3300 and am very pleased to have done so.  It is light to carry and  has a good hand grip plus an interesting variety of options - enough to keep the most enthusiastic photographer happy.  The VR (vibration reduction) option on the lenses is a big plus - I wouldn't want to be without it - and the zoom lens is indispensable.  Altogether a great camera with good reviews at a reasonable price.  I am very glad I chose this model.|#|
10.0|#|Kit is excellent value, the two lenses are ideal, the camera is small, light and takes remarkably good photos.|#|Slightly flimsy feeling.
8.0|#|This is my first SLR and I find it pretty straight forward to us and already taken some great photos and only just scratched the surface on what it can do.|#|
9.0|#|Also, as a side note - claiming Nikon cash back in the Xmas offer was quick and easy, it didn't even take a week to receive my prepaid card.  It was also very easy to register online for the two year warranty.|#|This is not the cameras fault, but I definitely feel the need to purchase a wide angle lens as the two supplied in this bundle have a much smaller depth of field than I am used to.
10.0|#|Such an easy camera to use and I was surprised at how lightweight it was as well.|#|Haven't found any yet!
10.0|#|Great camera and even better with the additional 33-500 big lens.|#|My only complaint is about the Nikon cash back service - £30 cashback for the camera and £30 for the lens but it comes on 2 credit cards both with £30 credit on. I want to use the cashback to pay off the amount I had spent on the camera!
9.0|#|Great all round camera, easy to use and get used too!|#|.......... It's hard to think of one
8.0|#||#|Come on Nikon sort this out.
9.0|#|Easy to use camera, with good quality lenses.  I used it for the first time over the weekend at an Airshow, and have got some excellent results, using the 55-300 Lens.  The camera easily swapped between action shots of planes and then more static shots of family friends.|#|None so far

6.0|#|Easy to use|#|



7.0|#|descent value|#|Not rechargable
10.0|#|Wow,Wow,Wow I deliberated long and hard about buying the D7000 but finaly took the plunge. As a very amateur photographer and buying such a high end camera would I being wasting my money! No, is the answer as the ease of use is first class. Obviously there are features that need to be read then read again but this all part of the journey on learning about photography. I find the18-105 produces really good sharp images and the vr is brilliant. Thought about giving a 9 for value for money but hey, when you want quality well you have to pay|#|Just my pics
9.0|#|Great Picture Quality, easy to handle and infinitely configurable to suit any type of photography.  2 Memory card holders, good battery life.|#|It's pricey but then quality always costs!
10.0|#|This camera truly is a top piece of kit. I use this as a work camera to supplement a D40 - consistent controls make it easy to start snapping pictures without any thought when upgrading. The D7000 has so many features there is a bit of a learning curve to getting the most out of it, but after taking the time to play around with it, the quality of the images is in another league compared to the (still excellent) D40. Having used the D7000 for about a month now, I can consistently get the shot I envision in my head. Couldn't be more pleased.|#|Occasionally the autofocus is non-responsive as though the camera goes into manual focus mode... switching it off and on sorts the issue - suspect it will be addressed in a firmware update.
9.0|#|For the price, you can't go wrong really - fantastic image quality, loads of features, really well built (not too big, not too small, feels well balanced with every lens i've tried with it). If you feel you've outgrown your entry-level dslr then this is a great upgrade and probably as much camera as most people will ever need.|#|Really nitpicking here - although the video quality is excellent, a flip-out screen and more choices of frame rates would have been nice. Also, with there being so many features on this camera, it may take a while to get to grips with it and it can sometimes be hard to find what you want in the menus.
10.0|#|In fact there is so much packed into this camera it is going to take me quite a while to really feel I know it well, the instruction booklet is 300 pages long, so it is great that there are some people who go onto youtube to explain things as well.|#|The software for retouching is good, I don't know how it compares with photoshop which I have yet to master but for now it willl do.
10.0|#|Great camera, easy to use straight out of the box. Offers an incredible amount of control for those who like to be more creative in their photography.|#|
10.0|#|Very fast, great view finder. Big screen. Great features, lots of options to configure the way you want to work.|#|Battery life if screen preview is on.
10.0|#|A truly incredible camera. Has features so far beyond its price point that it made it a must buy. Had a D70S and used a friend's D7000 for a day and having seen the massive difference in image quality I had no option but to buy. Well done Nikon for opening up such a great product to the us amateurs with pockets that don't extend into silly money.|#|
9.0|#|Really easy to use and setup. got shooting straight away with it and images were stable and of excellent quality. better than convential slr.|#|
9.0|#|It is as good as the many reviews of this camera say it is.|#|Expensive but that is also covered in other reviews.
9.0|#|Can be easily adjusted to user preferences.|#|18-105mm lens perhaps not the best starter lens.
10.0|#|I am still right at the beginning of learning how to use this camera but it is clearly extremely sophisticated|#|This is quite a camera and i think I need to buy a second manual to get the best out of it. Not really a bad point
9.0|#|Great image quality and will last me years.|#|
8.0|#|Image quality.|#|AF sometimes insecure, especially in dull conditions.
10.0|#|Excellent build quality. Extensive control system.  Best price I could find anywhere.|#|Not a bad point,but I would just point out,this camera is not for beginners.
10.0|#|The D7000 is very good for night shots. Shots taken at high ISO are amazing.. Its got a good feature set overall. i wouldn't recommend this to person who wants to simply shoot like a compact camera. The lens that comes with it is good for most types of shots. But not suitable for creative photos. the lens is made of plastic but that doesnt matter at all. i did buy a remote, CPF, and a macro lens with this. and they all work fine. the battery is amazing as well. very long lasting.|#|nothing that i see.
9.0|#|aaah so many more :) it's such a great camera!|#|
10.0|#|Simple to use, Auto or presets on board, HD Video,but also all you need for the experimental enthusiast to, great pics well worth the money|#|None
10.0|#|The picture quality is excellent also with superb noise control. I was also surprised to find the D7000 performs better than the canon 7D when comparing shots at my place of work..so overall its great investment.|#|The only bad point i have is the position of the ISO button...its way on the back which is really annoying having to swich your hand back to change the ISO. and you cant set it too the function button ether.
9.0|#|I have taken around 1000 photos within a week time and the picture quality is superb.You won't be disappointed if you go for this item.Good value for money.Great features.|#|No bad points at this time.
10.0|#|In many ways its more up to date and therefore better value than the D300s.|#|Really not much else as it really is a great camera.
10.0|#|Co|#|
10.0|#|This is a superb camera in every way. If you do not need full frame, then this IS the best dslr you can get. It knocks spots off the competion with crystal clear colour rendition and pin-sharp focusing. From fill auto to tailored manual settings, this camera performs.|#|None at all!
9.0|#|Got back into SLR photography and this is serious kit with plenty of room for the enthusiast to grow into. The D7000 is a great camera with some excellent in camera editing features. I thought about the D5100 but this is streets ahead.|#|Steep learning curve? Not a bad point really.
9.0|#|Many Features that allow both the Beginner and Experienced photographer to take great shots in all conditions, especially low light.|#|None as of yet only being using it for a few weeks.
10.0|#|Everything works perfect, great picture quality, very good battery life, easy to handle, true Nikon quality, highly recommended.|#|No bad points.
9.0|#|This is a fantastic camera overall. I'm still learning how to use it but have been able to get out and take several shots with it and am very pleased with the outcomes. The image quality is fantastic. I still carry the manual around with me and probably will for the next few months as there is a huge amount to learn in regards to the use of the camera. That is a good thing though as it broadens the scale of use. It will allow any hobbyist the chance to be creative.|#|
9.0|#||#|The above are tiny gripes - this camera looks, feels and delivers a premium experience. I would recommend it, and Nikon without hesitation.
8.0|#|Great camera|#|
10.0|#|Great piece of kit at an exceptional price|#|An SLR so it does not pop into your pocket
9.0|#|Fantastic picture quality, good solid quality feel.|#|Two part function dial took some getting used to after using D80 then D90. Need to spend more time using it, too busy!
9.0|#|The best Nikon DX camera availible today with plenty of features.|#|Very expensive, probally wont drop in price for a while since the new D600 is a Full Frame, therefore anyone wanting DX body still needs to purchase this on despite its age
10.0|#|Best value for any DSLR with this many features.|#|Has the same sensor as many other similar and cheaper DSLR's but has a better processor
8.0|#|Only just received the camera about three weeks ago but this is a serious bit of kit.  I deliberately bought a camera that is better tham I am having been used when young to film SLR photography.  Image quality is superb but I have only just scratched th surface of its capabilities.  Ask again in two years.|#|Price.  Sorry but this is true and you can say that I bought it anyway, but it is still expensive.
10.0|#|Feels like a pro camera, plenty of features. Really impressed video is sooo much beter than the D90 ( which I also own).|#|The auto focus for the video is very irratic. 6fps is a push and wont last long before buffer kicks in. But still a fantastic camera!!
10.0|#|Nice to hold, battery lasts ages too. Pretty easy to set up straight out of box.|#|
10.0|#|Stunning picture quality straight from auto settings. Lots of features still to explore. The  Instruction manual is well written and easy to follow. The build quality is first rate. I am extremley happy with this purchase.|#|none

10.0|#|Really sturdy peice of kit. A great investment in my opinion|#|
9.0|#|Great image quality and features.|#|Kit lens not up to standard of body. Default settings don't show camera's full capability.
9.0|#||#|- No articulated screen which would make face-level candid (running) toddler pictures easier. Although falling back to continuous shooting (and hope) techniques probably works as good as anything when your up-close and chasing a fast moving toddler.
10.0|#|Dynamic range and image resolution.|#|
10.0|#|I was really pleased with this camera kit. I am really an amateur in photography, but after a month I was really getting the hang of using the camera without using the fully auto facility. Very robust and easy to handle.|#|Not really any bad points, probably a bit pricey.
9.0|#|Crisp images. Has got good short cuts to various functions. Has plenty of features for amateur and professional photographer. True Nikon quality. Highly recommended|#|Many features . Takes time to learn. Although it's fun exploring the features. So actually not a bad point I guess!
10.0|#|Typical Nikon product, everything you expect.|#|If your a novice like me you need a degree to use it!
9.0|#|Dual memory card slots a great advantage.|#|A little bit expensive but would recommend it as a fantastic investment.
10.0|#|Very sharp images even on the edge. Versatile functionality|#|None
10.0|#|This is my first DSLR so I can't comment on all the functions.

9.0|#|great lens selection availability.|#|hunting - Great video.
1.0|#|Fast shutter speed, especially in low light conditions, though all this meant was that I took a lot more poor quality pics that were full of faults. Fast deletion of unwanted pics - which obviously came in useful.|#|Many very overexposed shots under 'normal' daylight conditions.  Chromatic abberation and fringeing also a big problem, especially around image edges, and though this can be rectified by buying another programme, it takes more time and money. Needed new programmes for editing, and although these have many new features, everything takes far longer than my old set-up with a Nikon D200, which is comparitively much simpler and gives far better results.  The D7000 was not what I expect from Nikon, and I have now sold it.
10.0|#|-fast|#|
9.0|#|Very good Camera.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|I'm happy with the picture quality, build etc. Well, it also depends on the kind of lenses you are using but overall with the kit lens also I'm happy.|#|Bit expensive, there is no other camera that sits between NikonD90 and Nikon D7000 in terms of price or features.
10.0|#|I recently went to a Air Show and managed to capture good shots of the fighter planes flying at a very high speed.|#|Too many controls, because I this was my first SLR I took more time to get use to the camera.

A lot of quick function buttons.|#|Additional batteries connector opens not wonted, sound of AF in movie, needs additional microphone for better sound, almost no effect of VR comparing to Nikon D40 without VR. Expected better quality of pictures as D40 according to price. Moving screen as D5100 would be better.

Great as a back-up camera for DSLR.|#|battery very expensive, only uses Nikon batteries.. 'cos they are chipped.  OVF is a joke - just a window.  Not really suitable for amateurs..  Will take quite a bit of manual reading.. suggest downloading Manual as PDF file.
8.0|#|I like the external buttons, the feel and is a great replacement to my old Nikon FE2 SLR. I also love the retro look to it.|#|To get the best out of it, you need to buy a photographer's manual such as David Busch's Nikon P7100 Guide to Digital Photography, as the camera manual doesn't tell you the crucial 'whys' of using just the 'hows'.

9.0|#|Looks beautiful, feels great. I found the viewfinder invaluable. It does only cover 80% of the picture area, but this means that the lens does not appear in the viewfinder when extended. There are focus and flash confirm lights visible, but no shooting data. The camera can be as easy  or as complicated as you want, but to get the best out of it you need to use the manual on disc- all 250 pages of it. It complements my D5000 very well, using the same flash and remote control, and uses the same Active D Lighting. It's love at first sight. I got over 270 shots, some video, and lots of menu settings on the first full charge. I can now wait before taking out a bank loan for a spare battery. The zoom memory setting is a nice touch, as is the facility to add a mount for 52mm filters and auxiliary lenses. There is also a mic input for improving video sound. The supplied View NX2 is a huge improvement over the original- it can now process Raw files.|#|Combined battery compartment/card slot in base of camera. Noisy zoom, even in quiet mode. Outrageous battery price. Slow to write in continuous mode. Fn2 options limited.

9.0|#|Excellent camera with all possibilities and much more easier to carry than a system camera.|#|Not possible to change objectives but does not matter very much while the basic one is very good. LCD can't be adjusted in all ankles.
9.0|#|Good image quality,good controls.|#|Poor ovf,better than nothing though.
8.0|#|Very versatile with lots of features only normally foundin a DSLR. Image quality generally very good. Excellent large bright monitor.|#|Highlights are sometimes clipped. Slow at recording images to disk, especially RAW.
9.0|#|Ease of use, good quality images|#|Cost and Not as good as a DSLR but then its not a DSLR
9.0|#|The control buttons are very handy. The Wide and  telephoto controls show the views in optical view finder. Exposure compensation works excellent. The tiltable monitor is excellent so the camera can be held at waist level to take pictures, while standing straight. Recording picture is quick using Sandisk Extreme card. I love the camera|#|Only 80% of picture can be seen through optical view finder. .Windows XP does not recognise the camera when connected to PC, need to remove the card from camera and use an USB adapter to read it.
10.0|#|Lovely camera|#|
9.0|#|Excellent images even in auto mode, but even better when fine tuned via the many optins available.   A camera that can be used with confidence in all situations.|#|None worthy of comment.

9.0|#|Good quality|#|Too heavy, slow zoom
10.0|#|easy to use. nice bright pictures. solid construction. manual override. althought viewfinder only 80% i personally find it very useful especially in bright sunlight.|#|none really.
8.0|#|This is the first of a high end camera that I have bought. The massive 42x Zoom is brilliant. There are quite a few nice features to produce brilliant images. I feel this camera is aimed towards people who travel a lot and would like to take landscape pictures and also those sports events when you have to zoom in to a player.|#|There's not much to complain about this camera. It is what it is, a bridge camera. However a slightly bigger aperture would have been fantastic for any photographer trying to take those blurry background portraits. Also the image sensor could have been slightly bigger but having said that, it is supposed to be a bridge camera and it does its job nicely.
9.0|#|I had the Coolpix P500 and decided to up grade. Love the Effects Option and the Panaramic Option. The extra Optical Zoom is amazing. Once you get the hang of all the Options and Menu, this Camera is fairly easy to use. Heavier than the P500, but so many more features. Well done Nikon!!|#|The only grip l have is when taking a snap it takes approx 3/4 seconds to return in order to take another photo.  This may be able to be altered, will need to look into this.
9.0|#|The camera is easy to handle|#|My only disappointment with the P510 is that I can't shoot in RAW.  As a Photoshop Elements user, I miss that feature.
9.0|#|Very happy with this my sixth Nikon Camera|#|Not found any yet.

8.0|#|Really good zoom. pretty good picture quality.  a few handy extras in the menu's.|#|Not as versatile as i first thought.
10.0|#|shhot' camera or if you're into twiddling with the bits yourself. Image quality superb, even at full zoom. I am so pleased I bought this camera after doing some research. A huge amount of camera for your money.|#|Neck strap could be a little longer.
10.0|#|Just what I need, I will never carry a DSLR around with me but do carry this and get amazing results for a fraction of the cost.|#|none found yet
8.0|#|I am a bird watcher. The 41x zoom is invaluable and the image quality can be superb in the right conditions.|#|If the object is moving faster than walking pace the focusing is extremely slow making life difficult. The printed manual is very poor and the online is little better; if you are a beginner then you will struggle to get the most out of the camera.
8.0|#|Easy to use point and shoot camera,excellent zoom and quite good picture quality.Battery life excellent.|#|Can not purchase filters for this camera without an adapter.
8.0|#|A smart compact bridge camera with an amazing zoom.|#|Tricky to hold. You need the strap as there is little room to get a good grip on the camera.

9.0|#|Excellent value for money!|#|Not had the camera long enough to find any real bad points!
9.0|#|the adjustable screen angle came in handy when I was photographing an animal at a wildlife park by holding the camera high up above the fence I could still see on the angled screen the image|#|wish there was a raw mode or at least tiff image, it only does jpg
10.0|#|Very good purchase, good value for money, I have bought a very good product.|#|I have not discovered any.
10.0|#|Being a novice, and have not had the P510 that long, it has many features that I don't understand at the moment, not the camera's fault, mine. Its easy to use, some features I figured straight away, having used a compact in the past. Image quality is very good in my opinion. Its a sturdy little beast, and I feel very good value for money, especially as it features a super zoom. Its exactley what I wanted, so my over all rating is high.|#|The Battery is charged through the camera, I would have preferred a seperate charging unit, but I have found my way round this, and just charge at the end of the day. I have a two batteries. There is no RAW on this model, but I'm not worried as I'm an early learner.
10.0|#|cant fault it,very light|#|none
10.0|#|It is a good multi function camera that is as easy to use as a point and click. Its not to heavy and the zoom function is great giving clear photos even when full zoom is being used.|#|I have found that the battery can be depleted quicker than a normal camera, however, I have been using it to take over 300 photos a day with the zoom function being used all the time. All in all a great camera with no real bad points.
8.0|#|The lens is truly good for my use....|#|Battery has to be charged through camera.   Main problem I have is the zoom in Video Mode refuses to focus beyond approx three quarters  of its capacity....Am going to inform Jessops of this, I am only an Amateur Photographer but if the camera has a Video Mode then it should work....
10.0|#|as a product I found this camera one of the best for the money if want a  good camera for the families snap shot or for close ups or way a head of you then this is a good all rounder|#|so far none
9.0|#|42 Optical Zoom.  General all round good features, although have not had chance to use it to it's full potential yet.|#|Product was missing the instruction manual when arrived, but was easy to download.

10.0|#|An awesome piece of kit without all the lenses|#|None
9.0|#|Bought this to supplement my Canon EOS and up to 1000 mm Sigma zoom lens which are brilliant apart from the weight to carry around all the time.  I often missed some golden opportunities when out and about because I often baulked at carrying the weight around. especially when I also had my telescope and binos with me.  Only had the Nikon for a 3 weeks or so and the results so far have been excellent.|#|Would have appreciated a raw mode.
9.0|#|The camera has a great zoom feature and the images are of a high quality.|#|The camera has been returned to Nikon as it stopped working and was diagnosed as being a problem with the internal battery and as I found it very difficult to contact yourselves I spoke with Nikon, and they asked me to send it to them which I have done. So therefore I am without a camera and one of the reasons I purchased it was to cover a wedding which is in the first week of November and it doesn't look like I will have it back by then.
10.0|#|Excellent Quality photos. No Red eye whatsoever. Lovely compact design. For someone who wants to take fantastic photos but doesn't want the drawbacks of owning an SLR then this camera is ideal.|#|The Lens cannot be removed, but I guess that that would be the next step up for the keen amateur photographer. Finding the time to use it to its full potential.
6.0|#|great stills|#|extremely difficult and sometimes impossible to get focus when recording movies.

10.0|#|Excellent 42x zoom. Easy to understand manual. It's very stylish in red. There are too many easy to use features to mention. If you've had a compact camera, the features and buttons are similar so don't be scared to move to a bridge camera. I'm glad I did and the results are great.|#|The viewfinder is very small and it doesn't come with a case.
9.0|#|Very well-featured, virtually SLR level functionality with the enormous zoom, also point-and-shoot modes available when you need them.

There are a number of dials and buttons which makes life less cluttered.two reasons I choose this camera were viewfiner or tilting screen to use in bright light and the rechargeable battery which is lighter, cheaper and lasts longer.|#|.

8.0|#|Excellent Camera...had it for about a week now. Amazing low light performace. If your like me and hate taking pics with forward facing flash then you'll like this camera...the F1.8 does make a difference. Havin said that when I have used the flash its not as harsh as some other cameras used, it does a good job at maintaining good colours and does'nt over expose.|#|Hardcore fans of Advanced Compacts would say not having RAW is a problem...it does'nt make alot of difference when your using for the intended purposes i.e. birthday parties..nights out...special occasions..as long as you get the shot. Most reviews talk about it having a metal body...feels more plastic to me..but still built well.

9.0|#|Great for kids.  Simple to use, waterproof and shockproof.

I'm still getting the hang of all the step-up features but I put a 50mm prime lens on the front and the picture quality was outstanding, even compared to pro cameras such as the D300 or Canon D7. I'd say great value all things considered.|#|I can't really think of anything
9.0|#|I got a D7000 as an upgrade from my D90. It was a fantastic choice. Its a great camera, its much faster at auto focusing than my D90, its better in low light and generally feels a much better quality camera than the D90 did. If your looking to upgrade from a D90 but can't yet afford full frame, this is a great choice!|#|

10.0|#|Value is perfect for this mid-range build going on to pro.|#|none to say of
10.0|#|AUTO and AUTO with no flash options, plus the ability to customise practically every aspect of the picture taking AND save those settings in one of the two User Setting modes. Obviously it takes some work to get to grips with all the custom oiptions but most of the time there's no need to go there unless you want to achieve a particular effect. The big advantage of an SLR like this (apart from the range of lenses) is the ability to have dedicated buttons for most of the useful settings (such as ISO, colour balance, quality etc). However if you need to use the Menus they are pretty straightforward with a useful on-screen help facility. The SCENE options are a useful quick way to get useful settings for Sports, portrait, high-key, low-key, night etc etc. Solid build, two card slots, excellent movie capability and the ability to use any Nikon lens.|#|
10.0|#|Very easy to use.. If you want to just point and squirt you can but if you want to get more advanced there is plenty of manual and semi manual modes.. For the money you cant beat it..|#|No Flash sync port for studio lights etc..
9.0|#|The image quality is stunning. The controls fall nicely into place and once you get used to the controls, a lot can be done without taking your eyes off your subject. The battery life is impressive, and the dual memory card slot allows options to double your memory, back up your shots or shoot one in raw and one in jpeg....love it|#|It would be nice to have the articulated screen llike the 5100. Otherwise no particular negative points.

10.0|#|It almost feels like an iso-less camera and i use up to 1600 without a second thought - in a pinch I would go higher. The controls are set out perfectly and I love the U1 and U2 scene modes.|#|The files are huge. time to upgrade the pc as well!
9.0|#|old Nikon 18-70. I used D5100 for 1 year and they share same sensor. Quality of pictures is amazing. But camera is not so important as your lens, keep this in mind.|#|
10.0|#|Value (there are now newer cameras available but this is an absolute cracker)|#|Perhaps slightly compact, light and small compared to some of the lenses you might put on it, e.g. the Nikon micro 105mm. Adding the battery grip is a good idea for balance and gives the camera an exciting fully professional feel with both vertical and horizontal grips possible.
10.0|#|Ease of use for beginners, yet lots of great features a semi-pro would love. Nice feature is 2 memory card slots. Battery lasts well. In camera editing is good. 100% view through view finder|#|Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm, it's a bit heavy.... the user manual is thick...ummmmmmmmm

10.0|#|image quality,menu access and operation are brilliant. the 39 point focus system and its variations are excellent, The camera gives a very professional image with minimal effort from the operator;I upgraded from a D90,the D7000 is a far superior camera but at almost twice the price you would expect it to be!|#|rather small body when using with a large lens so I just added a battery pack and that solved it,
9.0|#|A great step up from our basic DSLR, but you really need to use a guide (rather than the manual) to really understand the features quickly.  Ken Rockwell's website was a great help and quickly put me in a position to get more out of the camera.  It's definately a good camera for me to grow into while beign easy to set up and use automatically.|#|If you're thinking of the bundled lenses I'd say don't.  Get a smaller range zoom and then a prime lens for roughly the same money, the quality and speed of the prime lens will give better pictures than a longer range zoom.  For the price of the 18-105mm I bought a fixed 35mm and 55-200mm (I already had a Sigma 10-20).  It all depends what you want to photograph.  If you aren't sure about lenses then this camera might be a step too much for you.
9.0|#|love this camera. Just upgraded from Nikon D80 and love the 7fps and lack of noise at high ISO these are so important for my wild life photos. I have yet to try the video  but if results are as goob as the stills the I will be truly happy.|#|No bad points

10.0|#|The detail is excellent easy to use instructions no problem understanding them. I looked and resherched the DSLR ranges it came down to canon or nikon after looking at the photos taken by the top DSLRs i went for the nikon and i Took a lot of Advice from Ken Rockwells web site. I would recomend people listen to him as he is a straight talker and knows every bit of these high powerd cameras|#|

8.0|#|High spec, great IQ, easy to use, weather sealed, internal motor, good in low light|#|Have had the camera less than a month and oil spots are visible at small apertures.

10.0|#|double sd card slot, not much bigger than my previous camera (d3000), can use it with my other lenses plus can use nikon af lenses. ideal upgrade from d40/d3000. works really well in low light shots.|#|not anything i can think of :-)
10.0|#||#|Not really a bad point I can think of, maybe the haters on forums who think the D300s is better just because it is seen as a Pro camera?
10.0|#|Just a great DSLR camera with enough control options to keep any photographer happy, fantastic grain free high ISO if you need it and just feels great to hold, with of course for beginners a fully auto option which gives good results also but a camera a novice can grow into|#|1080p video option, if I want video i will buy a video camera !!!  this is a SLR NOT a video camera ( the video quality is great but for me not wanted)

10.0|#|ALTHOUGH THE INSTRUCTION BOOK CONSISTS OF SOME 320 PAGES, EACH SECTION IS CLEARLY WRITTEN AND ILLUSTRATED SO THAT IT TAKES LITTLE TIME TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THIS TRULY AMAZING CAMERA.

9.0|#|This is a superb camera. The only reason for marking down 'ease of use' is that it is a complex product that will repay some time spent adjusting the myriad settings. It is possible to use it 'point and shoot' of course, but who pays this much for a camera if that's all they want ?|#|I had some initial problems with the reading of the memory cards, but a search on the internet revealed an available upgrade for the firmware which has solved the issue.

Also metering with non-CPU lenses is good.|#|So many features means so much to learn to be able to make the most out of them!
10.0|#|Excellent build quality with very good control layout.  Good improvement with preset programs over the D90.  Video is superb especially with the autofocus.  Great all round camera.  Highly recommended.|#|None
10.0|#|This camera replaced a D200 and I have not been disappointed.  Image quality is great and the ability to use higher ISO without noise is very useful.  All the controls that I would normally require to change quickly are available without having to go into the menu system. Well built, with some weather-proofing, the rubber grips make for easy handling, they feel similar to the D200 but look sturdier. Older Nikon lenses can be used although I am currently using the 16-85mm DX lens.|#|The ISO button is not well placed being on the lower left of the camera back as opposed to being on the top-plate on the left hand side as in the D200.  The mode dial can be turned by mistake when taking the camera out of a holster type bag.

The image quality is beautiful with low noise and vivid colours. I love the build quality and the nice high pixel count LED display. It handles like a dream, and with 16MP gives my 18-200 VR lens a bit of extra reach as well. I'm well pleased.|#|To be honest I can't really see any apart from the price, although I still think it's worth every penny.

10.0|#|An excellent camera that has weather sealing and a part magnesium body and accepts all Nikon AF lenses. Well balanced and great picture quality.|#|It's not a bad point as such, but the reason I marked down the ease of use is that I am an advanced amateur and it is fine for me to use, but I wouldn't recommend it for a beginner.
8.0|#|Fantastic value|#|quite complicated
9.0|#|solid feel, obvious quality, nikon history says it all.|#|Doors for the SD cards and accessories feel a little suspect and nowhere near as solid as the Canon versions.
10.0|#|now D7100 coming out, this camera is still relevant and very much a top buy. The camera has lots of high end features, is easy to use and just gets the job done - top quality pictures. I am sure the two cameras named are very, very good but for the price the D7000 is just unbeatable. Don't forget the D600 will require new FX lenses (as DX lenses won't make full use of the 24MP, plus this camera has had issues with dust on the sensor) and the new D7100 is untested yet in the general market (although i am certain it will reveal itself as a great camera). You could wait and get the D7100 but for £600 or less the D7000 is a truly remarkable camera.|#|as mentioned in the good points, the arrival of the D7100 may put people off getting the D7000- but it shouldn't.
10.0|#|This was/is an upgrade from a much loved D80 and it was was well worth the change. The improvement is impressive, particluarily the build quality, the semi-professional features and the way functions can be accessed/changed without the need to go into menus - I love this camera.|#|The need to buy a new/different battery.

9.0|#|Highly recommended.|#|The pop up flash is a little fiddly to retract, but this is not a major issue as far as I am concerned.
9.0|#|The camera is sturdy and well built with  a wealth of features.  Image quality is excellent.  The optical zoom is superb and the flash works very well in producing glare-free shots.  The image sensor delivers good results in low light conditions.  Geo-tagging is effective.|#|The positioning of the flash is extremely irritating  it's on the top left-hand side and thus tries to rise up in exactly the same position where most people would hold the camera. It also keeps turning itself on by default.  The Wi-Fi is exceptionally poorly implemented.  The camera can't communicate wirelessly with printers, and the app which notionally allows the camera to upload images via Wi-Fi to smartphones (not tablets, by the way) simply doesn't work.

10.0|#|Incredible quality, razor sharp at all apertures. Wonderful build quality.|#|It is a little heavy!
10.0|#|I hope this review has helped you decide, but go to YOUTUBE and type in D700 and there are videos with reviews so you can see the camera in action.|#|You end up getting the camera and buying a SB900, then the partnership is just so good and the wireless flash is just amazing you go out and buy another SB900!!!! Oh........ and my girlfriend says that the really bad point about the camera is that I won't put it down.
10.0|#|Awesome camera, much better in my opinion than the Canon 5D Mark 2 which I had for a month before returning it and buying the D700.  Essentially a D3 in a lighter body, so the same top of the line AF, low noise and overall performance as Nikon's top end pro body.  Canon deliberately crippled the 5D which has rubbish AF.  So in my view no contest, and worth changing systems for.|#|Only negative is the lack of video which doesn't matter to me and if you really care about it, the price difference between the 2 compensates for buying a video cam.
10.0|#|solid build, professional quality|#|none
10.0|#|Has just about every thing.|#|Heavy and heavier with full frame lenses. I am sure the next version will have  a 24 mega pixel sensor. For an expensive Camera such as this surely Nikon could have thrown in their photo editing software free?
9.0|#|Amazing image quality, I`ve given it a 9/10 for ease of use -only because this is my first DSLR so I guess if you have had a Nikon before it would be very similar and therefore easier to use.|#|cost, but then compared with the D3 and D3x its not too bad!
10.0|#|This is a fantastic camera.I have been dreaming about getting a D700 for a while and finally managed it.It does NOT disappoint.From an imager quality point of view it is amazing-even on a cheap 50 quid lens.For low light it cannot be beaten and is on a par with the D3 for low light usability.I highly recommend it and would NOT give it up now unless something better I could afford came through.No chance of me affording the D3xs then!|#|I have not found any bad points with this camera.Its perfect!
9.0|#|Its a Nikon all my old lens fit|#|A little heavy but none other than that
10.0|#|The Nikon D700 is the affordable professional in Nikon's excellent range of very impressive cameras. It's a robust camera which has so much technology built in, it's almost impossible to take a bad photograph. I won't list all the features as I'm sure you will read the specifications however, I can say that the benefit of these features makes the D700 a very desirable camera. If you are considering buying the D700, go ahead and purchase, you will be amazed at the quality and delighted with the overall performance of this excellent camera.|#|Because the D700 is a robust camera, it is a little heavier than some. This only becomes a noticeable problem if you are wearing the camera all day, as I do, as a wedding photographer - the trade off for consistent quality however, is worth it's weight in gold.
10.0|#|low light capability is extraordinary. I photograph wildlife (often at dusk and dawn) and the D700 can shoot at high ISO with very little noise|#|The software that came with it is crap. I had to pay for an upgrade.

10.0|#|Has a great bomb-proof feel to it, and fantastic features which are easily accessable via a intuitive menu system|#|weighs a ton (seriously, it's a beast), and it's going to take ages to learn what all the buttons do
10.0|#|6/ Autofocus can be set to track and most of the time you can make it focus on what you want.|#|I had hoped that an all singing all dancing DSLR that claims to be able to use lenses from 1970s onwards would have spent a few pounds more to include the kind of focus aids that were built in as standard on SLRs until recently.

9.0|#|Camera is well made and is a quality product. Not a camera to take on without some previous experience of a high end DSLR.|#|Plastic LCD monitor cover damages easily but can be replaced. It is a heavy camera but that is the price to pay for such a good construction quality.
10.0|#|Fantastic low light capability. Full-frame picture quality. No need for flash.|#|No point buying this unless you know more than the basics. ie making use of the high ISO and metering/focus modes. You also need the pro-level Nikon lenses, although prime lenses (50mm, 24mm) are not so expensive and give superb results. Putting on 'kit' DX lenses is a waste of money. easy to knock switches over by mistake and to forget to re-set back to standard settings.
10.0|#|Just works. Full frame. Best low light performance of any digital 35mm.|#|heavy.

This camera can see in the dark :o) I am very pleased that I made the decision to go for this camera.|#|I cant say that I have really found any yet? with the above mentioned lens its quite a lump that will take getting used to.
9.0|#|Excellent build quality, yes it's costly but at least it feels expensive when you're holding it!

9.0|#|Has that special feel of quality item in your hands. Not used it much yet, mainly on standard settings but it's a step up from the norm and you can tell. This camera  has many features and unless you are a full professional, it's all you need. Good clear display and once used to the imaging area, very easy to use.|#|As per most quality cameras, they are expensive and heavy. If you use this type of camera then you also need top lenses and they are aslo very expensive.

10.0|#|I've only been using my D600 for a couple of weeks now but so far I have no complaints. My previous DSLR was a DX camera. The D600 is the first full frame camera I've owned I couldn't be happier with it.|#|I would like the focus points to fill more of the frame.
9.0|#|Full frame at reasonable cost, excellent image quality (providing you  use good glass and know how to use it) due to phenomenal 24 MP sensor, brilliant viewfinder, large LCD screen, good video, relatively low weight, good ergonomics, HDR, very useful U1 and U2 modes with preset functions, good battery life, compatibility with virtually all Nikkor lenses|#|Relatively low (consumer) build quality compared to D300/700 and D800, smallish focus area which might require frequent need to recompose a shot
10.0|#|The Nikon D600 performs well with pin sharp images to reflect the 39 AF point system. With great features, it is value for money from the full frame range. I would recommend it.|#|There isn't much to complain about with this camera. The only thing might be that because it's relatively new, it can be awkward to acquire cheap accessories.
9.0|#|My first outing with my new D600 was to shoot some pics and video of some local bands that I know.  My previous camera was a D700.  Without reading the instruction book, the D600 felt intuitive and mostly logical.  Having never used video before on a DSLR, I was truly impressed with both the sound and picture quality (I do not have the external mic) despite it being so dark I was on ISO 6400 most of the time.  Stunning images considering!|#|Otherwise, the point everyone else makes about the focus points being limited is also likely to annoy, but it hasn't yet.
10.0|#|great great great image quality, compared with the D800, couldn't find any difference. color depth and dynamic range is unbelievably of high quality. Don't fool yourself and buy high end cameras.|#|also build quality is not that solid as other pro cameras
9.0|#|The D600 is well designed and operation is straight forward. If you are making the step from DX to full frame the D600 is a must, rather than spend £1000's on the G lenses, look for second hand pro range lenses like the Nikkor Af 17-35 D wide angle and ED 80-200, 50mm 1.8 D lenses are perfect on the D600 and they're cheap. I love my D600, it's what the 800 should have been.|#|There have been reported problems with oil droplets on the sensors, I think this was down to a bad batch, mines fine.

8.0|#|Full frame make all the difference, now all my lens work the way how they were made to.  Stepping up from a D7000 most of the controls are in similar positions, the feel of the grip is more comfortable the weight is just right over all a really good camera.|#|Focus points all clustered in the middle.
9.0|#||#|Video a bit lacking.
9.0|#|I moved from a D90 to the D600 and it was an easy transition. All the features I'd been used to and more with the D600. It fires great and even with my not so good Sigma lenses it takes a bloody great shot. I'm loving full frame :)|#|Its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for and Nikon make THEE best cameras and lenses in my view.

9.0|#|Superb state-of-the-art full frame digital SLR camera.|#|Should have a New Zealand plug rather than a British one.
9.0|#|Better build quality and size than I expected and the camera feels very sturdy. Image and video quality are fabulous. The back screen is large and sharp.|#|Removal of dust removal technology is disappointing at this price point.

7.0|#|Our first digital camera so nothing to compare it with but satisfied with it so far|#|Battery time between charges shorter than expected
8.0|#|Small, light, fast response producing sharp vibrant pictures.|#|The feature control knob on the top of the camera rotates too easily and has been accidentally switched to movie on a number of ocassions.  This has gone unnoticed with th result that photograph opportunities have been lost.
10.0|#|Easy to use, excellent value for money, clear and easy-to-follow hand book.  Above all, good picture quality and definition.|#|
9.0|#||#|As with all cameras of this type, it needs a lightweight flexible cover for overall protection of the camera and screen

9.0|#|Small, well featured and easy to use. Battery life is good and the menus are easy to navigate. The shutter response time is good enough to catch an energetic toddler on the go!|#|The lens has to be uncovered while you upload pictures to your pc. This increases the risk of it getting dusty. No manual control over shutter speed.

9.0|#|light weight easy to use|#|screen does not show lighting prperly
8.0|#|Fantastic piece of kit.  Compact and easy to use, with varying functions that even a novice can find it easy to use.  No photography knowledge needed to produce good photo's.|#|Battery life is a little poor.  Requires charging after only a couple of hours use?

6.0|#|lightweight, easy to store, and good quality images|#|charging the battery means taking the battery out of the camera (which could easily get lost) instead of saving time and just plugging the lead into the camera directly.

10.0|#|There is such a lot on a compact camera.  The photo quality is fantastic and great value for money.|#|Nothing.
9.0|#|The size, fits into most pockets, and stylishness of the product its not going to look to outdated. The quality of the Nikon brand, and the fact that they still use the same memory card as my original 5 year old Nikon coolpix uses. Its quick to start up and once one photo is taken the time to recover is quite good for the purpose its intended for.|#|Battery life could be better. The screen gets messed up with finger prints too easily, maybe a protective screen cover could be provided like the mobiles have when you get them!
7.0|#|compact and well built|#|shutter release bit too small and because the overall size of camera is small it can be a little difficult to hold
9.0|#|all good small compact easy to use|#|have to remove the battery to charge. suppose this cuts down on workings inside keeping it small.
8.0|#|Excellent image quality for the size, comparable to my much larger Nikon SLR. Genuinely pocket sized. Robust.|#|Shutter release button too small - difficult to use in a rush. Unnecessary and irritating synthetic shutter click.
5.0|#|Its very small and light.|#|After using an Ixus the Coolpix felt really tinny and of not the same build quality. The UI is also lacking and in bright light it could do with a viewfinder.
10.0|#|Well built, easy to use, nice convenient size to carry everywhere.|#|
9.0|#|camera is compact easy to use with a strong case and good lense has many features on it and takes excellent quality pictures.|#|there is no view finder with this camera so if you are in bright sun light you can not always see the screen on the back of the camera.
10.0|#|Small compact design.|#|Battery has to be removed from the camera for charging.
8.0|#|Compact - good image results.|#|No viewfinder (although this seems a current feature with modern compacts) so difficult in sunny weather.
9.0|#|Very easy to use with most used features readily available.  Very slim which makes it really pocket sized. Image quality in good light is excellent, and flash works well over a considerably larger range than expected for this type of camera.  Used by whole family with generally good results from the start.  LCD screen is bright enough to use in sunlight as long as you are not wanting to see too much detail.|#|The exposure button is rather small and needs considerable pressure to operate.  This takes some time to get used to, well for me anyway with my man's hands.  Teenage daughter has used it without problems.
8.0|#|Easy to use with a quick start uop function to get you snapping. Good image quality and quick wirte to disk speed.|#|Some of the menu functions hard to find but you get use to it.
9.0|#|Small size, good screen size|#|Moving between menus - takes some practice unless used all the time.  Slow between shots - may be due to 4Gb card fitted.
9.0|#|The build quality is superb. Ultra small and slim but solidly made. Ideal for slipping in your pocket. The picture quality is excellent with many superb features.|#|The control buttons are very small and need a very delicate touch.
9.0|#|The camera takes good, clear pictures when using the right feature. Great size and very light!|#|Takes some time to get used to the features, but once you find out how to locate the menu options, is much easier.
9.0|#|Fhis camera was bought as an addition to my main camera i.e. to keep @ hand when a bigger camera was unsuitable. For this purpose the size and weight and picture quality is perfect!!|#|Charging is the only negative point - the battery comes out and is placed in a seperate charger - it would have been better if the charger could have connected direct to the camera (like a mobile phone)

3.0|#|Its light and small enough to fit in your hand bag.|#|The photos come out very unfocused most of the time. Which makes it annoying if you wanting a good photo you have to take it quiet a few times before you get it right so its not the easiest camera to use. Thought it had an anti shake so when you take a photo it would automatically focus.

Perhaps I was expecting too much from such a small bit of glass.

8.0|#|Easy to use in automatic mode solid compact camera|#|Difficulty getting it to focus on the area of the image required - going to try using manual focus. I had a coolpix 8700 which I loved and never failed to to take excellent photos with no manual adjustment so am quite disappointed with my P90 as the imaged are not as reliable.
9.0|#|light, compact, amazing zoom range 24x, good battery life. tilting rear LCD useful too.|#|shutter delay, save speed can be excessive due to size of shot, would recomend smaller frame picture size. the zoom control can be hit and miss.
10.0|#|The camera takes amazing photos, is easy to use and a lot lighter than a DSLR. The only thing I will say is that if you preview a picture on the built in screen the quality isn't as good as the actual picture taken, so don't delete pictures taken until you view them on a computer screen, you'll be surprised at the difference in quality.

10.0|#|Light and easy to use, very good zoom and on screen save of digitly zoomed picture. I liked it so much that I am going to buy another for my daughter.|#|Zoom button is a bit sharp and takes a bit of getting used to.

9.0|#|Easy to handle, excellent features,  value for money and it looks good.|#|
9.0|#|Many good points mainly all of the features and function.|#|One bad and that is the fact that you have to remember to take the lens cap off before switching it on.
9.0|#|Amazing zoom. Compact. Lightweight. Versatile|#|Zoom control a little agressive

10.0|#|I found this camera easy to use, I barely had to look in the manual. I was choosing between this camera and the Sony A200 and found the Sony too bulky where as the Nikon is alot more easy to grip. Overall I am happy I got the Nikon D60 and not the Sony.|#|
9.0|#|It takes great pictures easily, it's light and handles well.  All the controls are easy to use - you do have to spend a little time with the instructions, though!  I recommend doing so and setting up the camera the way you like it.  I am pretty much a novice when it comes to digital SLRs so if I can do it, anyone can!  The whole package is excellent - if you have kids (as I do) a decent camera is a must and this camera fits the bill superbly.|#|The built in flash can be a bit harsh - but that's just built in flashes for you.  The camera definitely benefits from a dedicated flash - I bought the Nikon SB-600 Speedlight to go with the camera and it's fantastic, I'd highly recommend it (and it's coming down in price as Nikon have just released a brand new top range flash, so good value for money).
8.0|#|The body is fine, and has all the features you could really want.|#|The lenses supplied weren't the VR ones I had thought I was getting, and aren't really as good - the optics themselves are good, it's just the image-stabilising software (at least I assume it's software) that is not there. And that's a real bonus, or would have been.

9.0|#|The size, fits into most pockets, and stylishness of the product its not going to look to outdated.

Its quick to start up and once one photo is taken the time to recover is quite good for the purpose its intended for.|#|Battery life could be better. The screen gets messed up with finger prints too easily, maybe a protective screen cover could be provided like the mobiles have when you get them!

9.0|#|camera is compact easy to use with a strong case and good lense has many features on it and takes excellent quality pictures.|#|there is no view finder with this camera so if you are in bright sun light you can not always see the screen on the back of the camera.

8.0|#|Compact - good image results.|#|No viewfinder (although this seems a current feature with modern compacts) so difficult in sunny weather.
9.0|#|Very easy to use with most used features readily available.  Very slim which makes it really pocket sized. Image quality in good light is excellent, and flash works well over a considerably larger range than expected for this type of camera.  Used by whole family with generally good results from the start.  LCD screen is bright enough to use in sunlight as long as you are not wanting to see too much detail.|#|The exposure button is rather small and needs considerable pressure to operate.  This takes some time to get used to, well for me anyway with my man's hands.  Teenage daughter has used it without problems.

9.0|#|Small size, good screen size|#|Moving between menus - takes some practice unless used all the time.  Slow between shots - may be due to 4Gb card fitted.

9.0|#|Fhis camera was bought as an addition to my main camera i.e. to keep @ hand when a bigger camera was unsuitable. For this purpose the size and weight and picture quality is perfect!!|#|Charging is the only negative point - the battery comes out and is placed in a seperate charger - it would have been better if the charger could have connected direct to the camera (like a mobile phone)

9.0|#|I must admit that Nikon D200 is my first digital camera. It is certainly user friendly, everything is placed where it should be. It has a lot of professional features, you can under and overexpose the photos, you can synchronise it with studio lighting, there is even Kalvin meter. With good autofocus lens(nikkor not sigma) one takes amazing documentary pictures of moving objects.|#|I red that the battery life is pretty long and I cannot agree with it. After taking 120 photographs(some with flash) I need to recharge it.Another thing is quality of image. It is fine in category of digital camera but one cannot of course compare it to medium format photography. In low light conditions you get a lot of noise.
9.0|#|A great camera bought at a competitive price.  The camera feels good to hold and its robust build inpires confidences during use.  In particular the menu system is well laid out and very clear to read.

9.0|#|Intuitive body design, build and feel - for me - as an advanced amateur, scores higher than absolute best picture quality. Easy to use menus. Rugged and dust tight seals a plus.|#|Battery life could be improved with 2000 or 2500mAh Li-ion instead of the 1500mAh supplied.
9.0|#|The build quality and general handling is superb with all of the controls falling easily to hand. The menus are extensive and initially appear to be very difficult to understand but in reality they are logical and easy to use.|#|If you could call it a bad point it is that the D200 is not a camera for the novice, it has taken me a while to settle in to using it but that is the challenge use it as much as you can and then it starts to fall into place.
10.0|#|Image quality is very smooth and exposure is accurate and reliable. I am finding that the performance of the focusing is more accurate and reliable than the D50 I owned previously.|#|A bit heavy but no more than I expected with a quality product like this.

Image quality superb as expected especially in uncompressed .RAW which is my chosen default quality - around 350 images to a 4GB card depending on subject, nicely backs up to a single DVD Rom|#|None. Some may criticise the weight but then robustness and build quality come from magnesium alloy chassis not plastic - a Rolls Royce is a bit heavier than a mini !

10.0|#|There's no contest - I should have bought the D200 first time around. But my wife will take over the D80 when it comes back from the menders - she prefers it because it's lighter.|#|The D200 is a bit trigger happy. It's very easy to fire the shutter when not intended. But hey, it's not like I'm wasting film. So a very minor bad point.

10.0|#|The Nikon D200 is not a full frame camera, but, it does take 6x4 photos. This is extremely good as when it comes to printing, then you don't have to crop any part of the image. The features are very easy to understand and use. Most of the features you would want to change are on buttons rather than having to go through a long list of menus. I did purchase the Canon 5D but was very disappointed with the image quoality around the edges of the pictures. The Nikin D200 does not seem to suffer from this problem and is fantastic value for money. I would recommend the Nikon D200 to anyone.|#|I can't say I've found a bad point with the D200 yet, but I am not a professional photographer!

10.0|#|Exceptional image quality. Live view is a useful thing to have.|#|I tried to test all the featres and the only thing I could find fault with is the built-in microphone which is noisy. However, I didn't buy the D90 for the video features so this is a rather moot point.
10.0|#|My first 'real' digital SLR (upgraded from Fuji 9600) and I'm absolutely thrilled with it! Was nervous about investing the money - but it was well worthwhile. The camera is so easy to use and the quality of image is fab. Would definitely recommend.|#|None that I've discovered so far.

10.0|#|The 18- 105 mm lense that comes with the D90 is definately worth it, and i have captured some really good images with the use of this lense. The focusing on the lense works really well and i have found that the lense 9 times out of 10 stay in focus moving from different shots which in my previous camera i had trouble with this and it came to be a problem.|#|As a semi professional / amateur photographer i think the D90 will be great for you and once you have found your way to navigate around your D90 you will find you will enoy the use of your new camera and be able to produce some amazing work from it.

10.0|#|Compared to my old Canon EOS 350 the Nikon D90 blows it out of the water.  Great camera.  Both the pictures and video quality is superb and the controls are relatively simple.|#|Watch out for the 'Active' D Lighting in high contrast shoots.  This feature runined one photo session by creating a halo effect around brightly lit objects when using a dark background.  I guess it has it's uses but beware.
9.0|#|As a 'Point and Shoot' camera it is second to none. The pre-programmed settings are easy to use and the ISO, shutter speed and appeture settings are easily altered after a few minutes practise. Image quality is superb and the software with the package is also, top quality.|#|Not really a bad point, but there is no Macro function on the 105 lens which is a feature I have used many times on my 35mm Minolta and I shall miss that, it is made up for if the 300 Tamron lens is purchased too.
10.0|#|after researching a lot I finally went for D90, good decision, would recommend it to all|#|weight. becoz of this u mite leave this behind and will not be taking it to whereever you go, will miss some great picture taking opportunities.

10.0|#|Very pleased with results from the D 90,Good build and quality, superb photographs.Has lots of things on it i didn't think possible.98% of the time what you see through the viewfinder is what you get. Good camera, good buy,would reccommend to anyone who wanted a good DSLR.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|-It's ability to shoot video in HD (720p) this looks fantastic as its shot through a high quality lens and so looks infinitely better than a camcorder in this price range. Just don't go moving the camera about while filming because you will get some weird shaky movements and you will have to re-focus manually.|#|some bad points include having to scour menus to find specific functions, the way the video shakes if you move it while recording and the way that while in LiveView mode the 'review' button changes to only adjust the brightness. Whats all that about?! i want to review the photos I've just taken :D
9.0|#|Having owned and reviews virtually every sub £1k DSLR over the past few years, the D90 still stands out as being best value for money vs image quality vs build quality vs usability - It really cannot be beaten. The combination of the technology that went into the D90 with its handling (especailly if you are reasonably familiar with DSLR's) is superb - Everything about the camera is a 'Good Point'|#|As a camera there are 'NO' real bad points, I personally prefer Canon's WB system as I feel the Nikon produces slightly cyan biased skies - This really is nit picking and it should not deter anyone from buying a D90 - You could say the video is a bad point but as Nikon was the first to introduce video into a DSLR it has to start somewhere and at the end of the day you still get 720p quality - Yes its difficult to use but it can be great fun trying
10.0|#|The camera is packed full if features that are typically found on more expensive models. The built in wireless flash controller allows you the functionality to control multiple flash units.|#|The 18-200 lens is not available as a kit, in replacement of the 18-105.
9.0|#|Solid build quality.In this price range and even above the quality of the photographs are excellent and that is using the kit lens. Auto focus is extremely fast using the continuous setting which is all that I have used.Cannot see the point of using other auto focus options unless using live view.All in all a very good purchase.|#|Basically paying for options which I won't use (Video recording, in camera editing, playback picture controls) but that is the same for which ever make of camera you purchase.
9.0|#|Well made, feels quality and the picture quality is fantastic. Alot better having the function buttons next to the top display and shooting at 4.5fps is great. 11 point focus is alot better over the 3 point focus on the D60.|#|None really.
10.0|#|bought it as a back up to the nikon d300, but I will use it more then that. simple to use, image quality as good as the more expensive nikon dslr, brilliant colours.|#|none
10.0|#|Stunning camera and lens combination; both very well built and sturdy to hold. Lots of features available on the D90, so a good read through the manual is essential. 18-105 lens has VR, giving you that extra couple of options on the shutter speed, f/8 seems to be the sweet-spot for this lens.|#|No ISO quick change button, you have to hold a button next to the screen and then change it using the rear scroll-wheel; a button on the top of the camera would have been much better.
9.0|#|It can do everything that I want|#|It takes time to learn how to use it, time to set it up in the correct settings for the picture you want to take.
9.0|#|An amazing camera with a lot of features and a good solid feel to it. Aimed at the keen enthusiast. Supprised at how good the high def video was. Very large clear screen.|#|May be a bit heavy for some with the 18-105 lens on it, would make sure your happy with the size and feel before buying online.
8.0|#|Sharp image even at full zoom|#|

10.0|#|A beauty of a Camera. - the only score of less than 10, ease of use, is due to the number of altenatives that have to be mastered. In time I would, no doubt, award a clean sheet of 10's|#|
10.0|#|This is a fantastic camera with so many features to use. It can be a bit daunting at times but the more you use the camera the more you get used to what it can do. I would say go and buy it if you want a serious camera.|#|Nothing yet

10.0|#|It takes amazing pictures, the HD recording feature is awesome, you could actually make proper professional looking movies with it. It captures pictures very good at high ISOs. I have only took pictures at up to 1600 so far and it hasn't produced any noise. I have yet to see noise in my pictures. I've only had it for a month, I would've given it a more in-depth review if I had used it intensively. But so far, it's awesome!!|#|The HD recording has some sort of a limit with the recording length, I suggest you do a little research about this flaw before purchasing this camera. Another thing I've hated about this camera is that it doesn't mount properly on my late 2007 MacBook, a way around it is to use Image Capture in the applications folder, it's a 2-step process to import your pictured into iPhoto. I don't think there's a fix for the problem either. I wish it was able to mount properly. Please research these issues before purchasing it.

10.0|#|Ease of use. Quick and fuss free video shooting. Easy downloading of images to computer|#|No auto focus whilst video is in operation.
9.0|#|A great versatile lens that came as a standard kit lens.  Much more versatile than the lower magnification zoom lenses offered with some other kits.  The VR allows you to use a lower film speed in lower light levels.  easy to use in manual mode.  No hunting when autofocussing and very quick to autofocus|#|have had slight over exposure when using the lens but this is probably due to my bad photgraphic techniques rather than the lens
9.0|#|Amazing picture quality. Easy to use.|#|A bit over whelming to begin with in terms of the amount of functionality it has to offer, but in the long run this is a plus point.
8.0|#|Great build, super HD video quality. Very good battery life.|#|Nikon software is a nightmare to use and when you make a copy of images you need to be very careful, because nikon give the image files an additional number which make file logging very differcult. Also because raw images are saved in Nikon's own format (Nef) they are not compatable with abode photoshop (have to upgrade to Lightroom) in order to do post processing if required, Nikon do not supply a full editing software , you will have to buy either Nikon Capture 2 or some other software. Viewing in PC My Pictures can only be doon after downloading an extra windows app.

Depth of field preview is something I've gone without since I last had a 35mm SLR, but it's great to have it back on this camera. Full colour histogram is a plus too.|#|Not found any yet but it's early days.
9.0|#|Fantastic - more control than you'll ever need. I moved up from a D40 and it provided all the upgrades I was looking for; better manual focus (it also auto-focusses better), better screen, no coloured moire, better support of lens types, great picture quality. Not cheap but worth every penny.|#|Could be cheaper (of course!). Some would criticise it because it's not built like a tank but personally I'd prefer smaller and lighter. It often feels like my brain isn't big enough to do it justice but with time....
7.0|#|The build quality is excellent, and despite some reservations about the lens based on reviews I've read, it seems fine for normal use. The rear-curtain sync - something I wouldn't normally use - has churned out some great shots already.|#|!

9.0|#|Great piece of equipment, still learning.|#|none
9.0|#|I haven't had it long enough to test it fully but from what I've seen so far it is an excellent performer. The 18-105mm lens gives you plenty of scope should you want to go out without carrying a bag full of lenses. I particularly like the 4.5 frames a second shooting ability and used this to get a sequence of my nephews coming down a helter skelter. Not only did it shoot rapidly but every shot was pin sharp due to the dynamic focussing from the 11 focus points. There is a reason why this camera is still being sold some 3 years after launch - if it's not broken don't fix it!|#|None really but I did find the top LCD menu a bit tricky to read (I need glasses for reading). This can of course be rectified by switching to the large rear LCD screen.
10.0|#|I am very glad that in the end I have chosen  the D90 because like most people I was truggling between the D90 and the D3100. Despite expert say that image quality is higher in the D3100 because the new processor the D90 is still a superior camera although it's been around for 2 years now. Also the D90 has a very strong body perfect if you do lots of outdoor. The D90 looks ineed more professional.|#|Perhaps it's a bit heavy to carry, but that it is also a good pont.
10.0|#|this camera is very easy to use and has many different modes, the lense is very good and it is very easy to change the shutter speed and apature controlls so overall this is a very good camera!|#|the only bad point about this camera is i have had trouble with the lense as it wobbles when it is on.

10.0|#|Good all round camera and easy to use.|#|None so far!
9.0|#|Well Balanced, Natural Hold... Great Image Quality|#|Not environmentally sealed, takes a little getting used to if you're not familiar with NIKON.

9.0|#|The camera is easy enough to use. Image quality is astounding and the bundled lens makes for a very good starter package.|#|It's a little bit more pricey than the Canon's but I do prefer the images captured by the Nikon.

10.0|#|Picture quality is amazing|#|No bad points, but it will take a bit of time to learn to use the camera really well
10.0|#|indoor pictures great flash|#|none
10.0|#|Superb camera, with loads of features, allowing you to set it up just how you like. It also includes many in built filters saving you money buying them as extras. The lens is amazing, great range and the VR feature is excellent.|#|If you want to use the video side of it (which is great quality) it could do with more features, but given this feature is new to DSLR then there is little room for complaint really
7.0|#|Awesome camera, awesome images. Great features. Means it's the best camera I've ever owned.|#|There is a problem with the camera freezing at random times. It turns out this is due to a build quality error between the kit lens and the camera bayonet which is solved simply by slightly twisting the lens. This is not a huge problem, but certainly a niggle that people should be aware of.

4.0|#|Easy to use. Features just like other Nikon cameras.|#|After a couple weeks of use, the Manual function stoped working. Adjustment dial did no such thing. Only the Auto function worked. Obviously this was not of any use. Because of this, I don't think it's for heavy use.

7.0|#|Quick to turn on, really good zoom. Feels solid and takes normal AA batteries instead of a silly packaged battery.|#|In some indoor and low light shots the image has a bit of noise. You can only get to the setup menu from play mode and not camera mode which is a bit confusing.

3.0|#|Its light and small enough to fit in your hand bag.|#|The photos come out very unfocused most of the time. Which makes it annoying if you wanting a good photo you have to take it quiet a few times before you get it right so its not the easiest camera to use.

9.0|#|light, compact, amazing zoom range 24x, good battery life. tilting rear LCD useful too.|#|shutter delay, save speed can be excessive due to size of shot, would recomend smaller frame picture size. the zoom control can be hit and miss.
10.0|#|The camera takes amazing photos, is easy to use and a lot lighter than a DSLR. The only thing I will say is that if you preview a picture on the built in screen the quality isn't as good as the actual picture taken, so don't delete pictures taken until you view them on a computer screen, you'll be surprised at the difference in quality. I would buy another one if I ever needed to.|#|

9.0|#|Excellent image quality (reduced only by the kit lens, but still capable of exceptional images). Very good low light capabilities particularly when using bulb/timed exposures. Well balanced handling. Extensive in-camera image editing for those that require it. 19 scene modes for new DSLR users who wish to 'get up and running' quickly before progressing onto manual modes. Swivel LCD screen is very useful and great for protection when stored. Excellent battery life. LiveImage ability. Quick auto focus with 11 point area selection. Superbly intuitive display which allows new slr users ability to comprehend aperture size and numerical value.|#|Some functions resigned to menu system. Not as bad, however as some reviews suggest as majority of primary functions (aperture, shutter speed, ISO setting, flash etc.) are/or can be assigned to individual buttons and dials. Lack of dedicated autofocus motor in the body so lens choice is limited (by price and not availability). LCD resolution not the best so view images on your computer before deciding to delete them. HD video is capable, but limited to 5 minutes in true HD.
9.0|#|Highly recommended.|#|Navigation takes a bit of time to get into, as I tend to 'jump in' to any new toy. It's worthwhile getting a decent book to accompany the standard instructions.
9.0|#|great fun and the movie mode is easy to use.  There is so much right with this camera.|#|There are less buttons than some Nikons, so menus do need to be entered into.
10.0|#|this is my first camera of this type (slr) and have found it so easy to use and under stand the instruction booklet is so easy to follow instruction. what a great piece of equipment for the price|#|none
10.0|#|This camera is AMAZING!!! It is so easy to use, and produces phenomenal images! It handles every aspect of my day to day photography with fantastic results every time. The tilting screen is really useful. I thought it was a gimmic at first, but it is really handy - especially with macro work! The battery life is amazing, as is the 4fps (very handy when shooting pets!) The 11 AF points are very efficient! I just love this camera, and would without doubt or hesitation recommend it to any beginner/amateur to DSLR photography.|#|The supplied manual is perhaps a little bit daunting, with over 200 pages, but you shouldn't use it too much, as the camera itself is very easy to operate.
9.0|#|Great battery life. I was able to take over 800 photos on first charge, excellent! The image quality is great, easy to use and well built. Great camera for the money! I would recommend that you buy a decent memory card - I got the Sandisk 8gb but was advised to get the 30mb/s version Extreme as it will process the photos quicker when taking them plus its better for recording the HD video. (Sandisk 8gb, 30mb/s Extreme).|#|None as of yet.
9.0|#|to capture otherwise impossible images.|#|The auto-focus isn't perfect, particularly in very low light.  For some reason, the camera seems to allow auto-ISO up to 3200 (which I have set) when using the flash - i.e. rather than using the full flash power it ramps up the ISO first.  I don't know whether that's me or the camera, though.
10.0|#|This is a fantastic camera.  You can start snapping away straight out of the box whilst learning the advanced elements at the same time.  Get a 200mm zoom lens to go with it and you won't look back.|#|Instruction manual is overly technical.  Do yourself a favour and buy one of the more plain english ones on the market (eg Magic Lantern Guides)
10.0|#|Feels very solid and buttons not too small for large fingers, making it easy to use. The automatic feature produces excellent results from the start, while you digest the quite considerable manual to experiment further. Is doing everything I ask of it so far, with loads more to learn, and even as a DSLR novice, it is producing great results. Glad I bought the extra lens bundle as I use to 55 -200 lens the most - takes lovely crisp nature shots..|#|The supplied Nikon PC software is not as user friendly as, say, Canon (same critisism with my Nikon Coolpix), so I tend to use the Windows Picture facility.
9.0|#|Menu system is clear, but you do need to learn where things are to get the best out of it. Auto mode will take a technically good shot, but it is capable of much more.|#|Handbook could do with a few colour examples to make things clearer.
10.0|#|I had a D60 before which is great, thought I would upgrade to this D5000, so pleased I did as this unit has more than I can use at this time plus movie feature which I wanted.|#|I have not found any bad points yet!!
10.0|#|picture quality is brilliant   and the special features  are very good  .|#|no actual bad points
10.0|#|Fantastic camera for both beginner and intermediate photographer alike.  Superb image quality, very easy to use and more functions that you will need to use for any situation.|#|No internal auto-focus motor can limit your lens choices - that said, there are more than enough lenses with built-in auto-focus systems (AF-S, AF-I) and you can use the non-auto-focus lenses to learn more about photography by using fully manual systems.
10.0|#|Fantastic all round camera for the price - shop around for cheapest UK model (so you have the nikon 2 year warranty) or you might pick up a model (then the warranty is with the retailer not nikon!) please check. Camera cannot be faulted for price and very pleased with results - easy to use.|#|None at all - its that good of a camera!!!!!
10.0|#|The D5000 is easy to handle and can be used straight out the box. Time is needed with the manual to gain access to all the advanced features, and I don't think you will run out of them. Being a Canon fan from the 35mm SLR day I was skeptical about moving over to Nikon, should have done it sooner. Overall the best SLR I have owned.|#|Still looking for them.
10.0|#|Very quick to first picture shot. High quality shots|#|Overwhelming number of features to a Noob DSLR owner however it can be kept on auto until you get to grips with it
10.0|#|Great Image Quality, very useable camera|#|A bigger higher resolution screen would have been appreciated

10.0|#|This is a brilliant camera.  I am studying A Level Photography and this camera has been an excellent tool for producing good quality photographs.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a good quality value for money camera.|#|
10.0|#|I rate this camera as in between a starter and professional model. The build quality is very good and  handling and grip seem to be just right. Image quality is excellent, even if you are a starter, just use the full auto function with or without flash as the circumstances allow and you will get excellent photos. When you are ready for more, go and explore the more advanced features which very closely parallel those of more expensive professional models. For me the best feature is the screen which can be twisted around to any orientation and I use it mostly in the closed position - if you use an SLR and look through the view finder mostly, why do you need a screen to consume battery power needlessly and allow it to be smudged by the skin of your cheek? The standard kit lens it comes with is very good quality, it is a Nikkor lens after all, but it is limited in focal range. You will soon be investing in more  lenses, but that's just the beauty of an SLR with the option to change lenses. I thoroughly recommend this camera to all serious amateurs and maybe professionals should give it a go?|#|none I have come across
9.0|#|I have never used an DSLR camera before but wnated something that I wouldn't grow out of too quickly either.  This is a great camera and I am 100% pleased with my buy!  I would recommend this camera to beginners and intermediates.  The video is also a great bonus.|#|None that I have found so far!

8.0|#|Looks a little cumbersome, but really easy to hold and I have very small hands. Also reasonably light. Twisty screen  means that lcd screen can be protected and can also use it in live mode.|#|

7.0|#|Excellent image quality especially in low light - very little colour noise and performs well at high ISO settings.  Solid build quality and easy to grip. Battery life is long.|#|A little bigger and heavier than it's competitors. Others in the same price range have more features, especially Sony. Digital zoom would've been nice. Video capture quality is  poor for a camera in this class.

9.0|#|Excellent quality and value for money.  Have always used Nikon cameras and this one is just as good as the previous ones.|#|Slightly more complicated than previous cameras but will get used to it.  No case included with camera as previous which i feel should be included at price i had to pay.

9.0|#|Feels like a quality camera and had features of a much more expensive camera - once you factor in prices and cashback this is a bargain !|#|For some it will be too heavy (tho' same as most in that quality category).
8.0|#|This is a great camera and the image quality is superb, as always with Nikon lenses.  I have had a Canon film camera for 30 years with different lenses and I am definitely a convert now.  I set it permanently to 'Vivid' by default on the clolour balance which gives great colours and the active D setting helps to bring out detail in the shadows.  It is nice and light (for a DSLR) with the standard zoom and in fact the standard zoom is enough for most purposes.  I bought a good tripod and the images are even sharper with that. The best photo i have taken so far is of 130 staff at my workplace standing in a filed together an the multizone focus worked a dream, with only the very back row looking at all fuzzy.  i like Ken Rockwell's website which helped me to choose.  i like the swivelling screen and took some great pics of my 2 yr old niece from ground level, but the viewfinder on the D90is bigger and better.|#|Too complicated in some ways.  there is a load of on camera stuff like the whole menu area on what you can do with the comleted image (eg apply sepia, trim, filter etc) which is best done in photshop (or the open source prgram that i use called 'the gimp 2' for free).  I personally would naever have bought a full frame FX camera because i would never carry around that amount of weight, but it is a shame that this one is 'only' 12Mp, where the equvalent canon is now 25 Mp which allows for you to shoot professional quality A4 shots (ie magazine covers)  or so I understand.  I may be wrong on that one.  The other thing of course, is price.  At this price range, we are looking at something just under a pro camera, but as the technology gets more developed, same as racing bikes, you should be able to see the spec rise to the current pro level sooner or later.

9.0|#|loads of features and very easy to use in automatic mode. A well balanced camera which takes excellent pictures. Viewfinder is clear and bright and means that the digital screen doesn't need to be used a lot of the time except to check post shot images.|#|Not really a bad point but if you are moving up from a compact digital camera, be aware that the raft of features on the Nikon take some getting used to and if you are not an experienced photographer then some serious reading of the manual and practising with the camera are essential if you are to get the best out of it!

9.0|#|I upgraded from a D70s and the picture quality was much much better - it has to do with the internal picture processing. Features are truly amazing with video also that is a bonus. Was thinking of the D300 but the sensor is the same so I decided to save my cash and go for the D90 instead. I am truly not disappointed. The resolution is a big help when cropping in PS|#|Was disappointed that the battery was not the same as the D70s- as usual Nikon do not offer and decent software to work the photos on computer.

A truly lovely camera, great build quality, great images (if I point it in the right direction) and easy to set up and use.|#|None to speak of. I've heard mixed reports about the bundled software but can't comment as I just download the pics and get busy in Photoshop.
10.0|#|Easy to use, very good quality. Balances well in the hand.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|Excellent camera. Has all the features of a much more expensive wrapped up in an easy to use package. Menus are easy to navigate, lens has a good range, all buttons are solid and well made.|#|Maybe a little too much plastic - but that makes it lighter, build quality is excellent though. Not really a bad point, but i had to write something!
9.0|#|Good high quality digital SLR. Light years ahead of a compact digital camera. Looking forward to Christmas and shots of my granddaughter.|#|Like all other cameras of this type it is complicated to use and needs a lot of practice, and reference to the manual, when not in full automatic mode. Regardless of this very pleased that I purchased this model.

8.0|#|The Zoom lens is simple and effective and I think has some advantages over the two lenses (18-55 and 50-200) that were supplied with the Nikon D40 that I bought for my wife. However with the two cameras and the range of lenses we have between us I think we have the best of both worlds|#|
8.0|#|very easy to use starter lens that covers a wide focus range|#|
9.0|#|The D80 is simple enough for beginners.  Focussing is fast and quiet. Manual focussing is easy to access and to use.|#|The auto programme cannot be used with the button that locks focus and metering but Prog Mode can be used after resetting focus zone and metering zone.  Once you move from Auto, you have to know the camera pretty well to set it up.  Best left in Auto or Prog for a while.

8.0|#|Sturdy, well built feel without being too good - handles well. Hard to get to know as this is my first slr - so this is more something to do with me rather than the camera. Overall, I love it and am glad i chose this model (after extensive research).|#|Manual is poor. I bought a separate user guide without which I'd take a lot longer to get to know the camera. Also it does not have image stabilisation, unless you get the expensive lense.

Excellent image quality especially the sharpness of the 18-135mm lens|#|18-135mm lens hunts at the longest end of the zoom meaning you have to switch to manual focus. Quite marked barrel and pincushion distortion and the extreme ends of the zoom lens.

9.0|#|Very easy to us and produces great quality images for the rice. This is an idea camera for a novice photographer and can be built on as you improve.|#|Lens is great for larger images but doesnt get in close enough for those detailed shots but that can be overcome with a replacement lens
10.0|#|This is a great little camera: it is light and yet well built and the lens is very good quality. The auto mode means one can just snap away and the settings mode allows creative and more serious photos.|#|Battery life can catch one out. For special work I would suggest carrying a spare battery.
9.0|#|Picture quality is great, very easy to use.|#|

9.0|#|the camera gives you a desciption of what that item does. Even down to changing lenses, i found was a piece of cake.|#|I can't think of any major bad points, maybe if i was being really picky i find the camera does so much i am am never going to use all the funtions.
9.0|#|Very good quality images for the price, a huge leap ahead of even the most expensive' point 'n' shoot' cameras. A great first D-SLR|#|Could do with a better instruction manual, takes a while to get used to the settings if you have never used an SLR before.
7.0|#|Battery life is extremely long. I took mine to an airshow and it happily went through 1500 photo's using only one bar of battery life. Auto focus is good as is the focus point system.|#|The vibration reduction system seems to make no apparent difference to photgraphs.

9.0|#|This is my first digital SLR, I've been wanting one for a while and now they are becoming affordable. .  I bought the Nikon  DX 55-200 lens to expand my scope.  Changing the lens is easy.  I haven't had time to test out all of the features yet, hence the low score for now but it's a great 1st time camera.   I know I will be happy with it for ages.|#|Haven't come across any yet.

10.0|#|mode is excelent for field work as well as indoors.|#|If you spend this sort of money on a camera body you must have the lenses to complement it. Come to that, your system needs to be upto it. DX lenses will not do it justice. Plus you will need a compatible flash system. Be prepared to spend.
9.0|#|Excellent camera, I really enjoy using it.  I already have the D700 so I have found my way around the D3S very quickly.  Very impressed at how useable the images are at high ISO.  Have used ISO 6400 at a recent wedding and the images are great.  I love having the option of using the movie mode, again, excellent quality.|#|Small hands will find it hard to reach the controller (to move focussing bracket) when using the camera for portrait shots. I've not found the images to be as sharp as I expected even at low ISO but I need to test it more thoroughly against the D700.
9.0|#|High quality pictures in low light levels - outstanding|#|Cost!
10.0|#|Fast; high ISO quality is good in low light and much better than the D300; low ISO produces clear images; I like the FX feature in the D3S.  This camera in combination with my Nikon lenses produces excellent image quality; auto focus operates much faster than expected.|#|Costly
10.0|#|Absolutely brilliant camera - Nikon has given us the ultimate photographic experience|#|The strap could be made of higher quality and thicker material

10.0|#|In my view this is clearly the best general purpose/reportage camera available.  Everything works well and many things, such as the image quality and noise level, max ISO, autofocus and rapid access to all the key functions are outstanding.|#|Expensive, heavy, but given the current state of technology the best available by a clear margin.  If you are a landscape photographer look at the D3X and equivalent Canon.
9.0|#|bright viewfinder makes it easy to focus manually if needed even in dimly lit areas.|#|bulky if not used to cameras with battery grips attached (although not much noticably heavier or bigger than my Nikon D200's with grips attached). it's an expensive purchase, but with the build quality it should, hopefully, last many years.
10.0|#|For pro's you cannot beat this body. ISO is amazing. Motor drive at 9 FPS is amazing. Dual card slots is amazing. It's just amazing.|#|Helps if you know what you're doing because it's an advanced camera. But nothing you can't learn on YouTube or in a manual.

9.0|#|Overall I've been impressed with the Coolpix L22. It is extremely straightforward to use, with an easy to navigate menu that allows you to either select auto mode and let the camera do all the  work, or choose from one of around twenty scenarios (close up, night landscape, etc.) to ensure you always come away with the best possible picture. The image quality was extremely good, and even when using the digital zoom didn't seem to affect the quality of the resultant image to any noticeable degree which is handy; although I best point out that the optical zoom is normally sufficient. I broke my camera in at Reading Festival 2010 and got some amazing photos even when at the back of the crowd, and thus relying on the zoom feature.|#|The only downside to the camera is it's shutter speed in dark conditions. When used at Reading Festival 2010 the photo quality dropped off when taking photos at long distance at night as the long shutter speed coupled with the zoom resulted in the bulk of photos becoming blurred. However I was still able to take some decent photos even in these conditions, so the issue can be overcome with some patience!
8.0|#|Best point and shoot camera I've used by some margin! Autofocus very quick to adjust. Excellent colour re production on outdoor shots (except perhaps reds can sometimes be a bit pink?)|#|The flash is a bit slow to re charge for multiple indoor shots + it can occasionally wash out the off shot, but overall its NOT a bad camera at all!
8.0|#||#|I was terribly dissapointed with the quality of long distance shots.  Landscapes become blurred and quality lost. the more zoom that a subject requires.
10.0|#|Easy to use, great pictures, like the continuous shoot mode and the picture count down.|#|Would have liked a camera with rechargeable batteries but so far battery life has been good.
10.0|#|Used it for the first time the weekend at my cousins wedding and it took really good pictues. Already have a Nikon D60 SLR so I didnt want to spend a lot of money, and I know how good the photos are with Nikon. I wasnt disappointed. Really good value for money. The camera is really easy to use. I read a lot of reviews on different cameras and this camera seemed to have the best review. I cant disagree.|#|I really cant fault this camera.
9.0|#|Good quality pictures in a variety of different settings . Battery life very good . Lightweight construction but sturdy .|#|Software can be  a little confusing , i.e transferring stored pics to other storage sites for sharing .
9.0|#|Looks great in red. Easy to use with both Auto mode and 'Easy Auto Mode'. Easy auto mode is as like 'Point and Shoot' as you will ever find in any compact. Although it does't have as many facilities as other compacts I have owned, it has enough for most of us who want to keep it simple.|#|I am getting good results, although some of the flash photos get fuzzy on occasions. However, most photos in low or poor light are good- maybe it is just me getting used to the camera. I wouldn't let that put you off- I have had many excellent results in good and poor light- and I think the camera is excellent value for money.
8.0|#|Easy to use and takes some good quality photos. The menu system is quick and easy to use and it has a good array of features. The movie function is pretty good too, although it's only 640x480 but then at this price just having a movie function is a bonus. The camera looks good and is very compact.|#|at this price I can't think of any bad points.
10.0|#|so very easy to use. main reason i bought it. cannot fault it. used it for my wedding pics and results are great. thanks|#|not being a professional or very good with (gadgets in general) could not really say i found any bad points.

It's very easy to use to use and image quality is fairly good, far better than I expected for the price i paid for the camera.|#|Nothing really bad to say about this camera, I cant fault it for what I need it for. Some more avid picture takers may wish for more features but if you are after a camera for taking holiday snaps etc you cant go far wrong.
9.0|#|The main reason for buying this camera, was my old camera drained it's rechargeable batteries like there was no tomorrow even when not in use!  This one is great as you can use AA batteries making life easy. Buttons are good and easy to use and it feels more responsive, focusing features are good also and pictures quality is fine so far.|#|

9.0|#|Simple to use, better than expect image quality, fantastic screen, nice and compact - my wife carries it in her handbag all the time so we always have a camera when I cant be bothered to take my DSLR.  The ideal first digital camera / childs camera, or as a backup.|#|
9.0|#|This is an ideal point and shoot camera at a very competitive price. The easy auto mode is sufficient for most point and shoot photo options. The larger screen on the back is much better than previous versions.|#|none so far.
7.0|#|The camera appears to be well made. At the time of purchase it was a good deal. The warranty of one year is extended free of charge by Nikon to 2 years. It takes an SD card so I can plug the card straight into my Apple mac book and my daughters old laptop|#|The autofocus is not as good as I had hoped. I generally take more than one shot if I need to make sure it is a good one. When the focus has worked properly, which is most of the time, the pictures are really clear and sharp. I guess I am comparing it to my Nikon SLR so am perhaps being a bit harsh, Having said that my wife's Sony autofocus compact seems to get the focussing right more often than the Nikon Coolpix.
9.0|#|Small and handy to carry. good sized screen to view photos. Image quality very good when enlarged on computer screen and when printed.|#|
7.0|#|Easy to use. Good value for money. Has lots of features and I like the smart portrait mode. Prefer the AA batteries as they are instantly changeable rather than having to wait for lithium ion battery to charge and I find these run down quickly anyway.|#|Would prefer to have a full manual rather than on disc. Flash does not seem very effectiveunless you are really close to the subject. Pictures taken with the zoom feature are not sharp and pixilated.

10.0|#|We bought this camera a couple of days before going on holiday to South Africa.  We didn't have time to read the full manual and relied on the quick start guide.  We were absolutely delighted with the results.  Any poor quality pictures were down to operator error and the photographs that we managed to get of the animals in the Kruger game park were stunning.  I would definitely recommend this camera.|#|No bad points that I can think of at all.

9.0|#|Very happy with image quality for the cost. I tried several cameras close up shots long distance , artificial light flash, low light. and compared images, in the tests I dis this came out best in the price range. Of course if you spend twice as much you will find better. but if you are on a budget try this.|#|I would have liked the full instructions included on paper instead of a PDF file on  a CD. I knew what I was buying so nothing was a disappointment, again if you pay more you will get more. It does what I hoped it would to the leval I wanted.

9.0|#|can take excellent pictures outside and is especially easy when using easy auto-mode as it selects the best funtion to use itself and takes the guess work out of it.|#|I couldn't get the flash to come on when i wanted to at times and when on auto-mode it sometimes wouldn't select the flash to come on even tho it was dark. I found that some pictures came out blurry as tho people had been moving when taken in the dark even tho no one had been.

1.0|#||#|After carefully reading reviews about cameras I bought three of of these Coolpix L22 cameras at Christmas time, one each for my two boys and  one for myself . I can honestly say it is the worst camera I have owned and it is an embarrasment. You are lucky to get one sharp photo out of perhaps three, really disappointing . O.K. it's not an expensive camera but should be taking better quality photographs than this is capable of, the basics of a camera should be focusing!  I have won awards a couple of times in the past for taking photograps so I know how to use a camera.

10.0|#|Easy to use, looks great, and does everything almost everything I want it to do.|#|I would have liked the camera to have a function allowing the 'self timer' mode to be switched on, until switched off by the user, or by the camera being switched off, so that when you are using it, you don't have to keep resetting it!

7.0|#|HD video capable - 720 (but beware of large filesizes and slow upload to internet)|#|in video mode you hear the sound of zooming in your footage
10.0|#|The camera is stunning, it is truly a star, it's even better than I thought it would be! I really like the crisp image quality. Colour and light balance are perfect everytime! It might be pocket-sized and compact but don't be fooled, it certainly packs a mighty punch into a small package! With a 10x optical zoom lens nothing escapes me now! This model also boasts an excellent high quality video option too! Start up and shoot mode is just seconds, so you'll never miss that perfect image!|#|There really is nothing bad about this incredible camera, but if I have to pick something I would just say that the trap door for the battery/memory card looks quite flimsy and would need a bit of careful handling on opening not to damage it!
10.0|#|Very easy to set-up and use, very good zoom and really clear pictures. The image quality on the display is quite amazing|#|None really.
9.0|#|The main attraction for me when looking up this camera was that it had such a spectacular macro setting. I love taking close-up pics of flowers etc for my art, and this camera allows you to get as close up as 1cm! I know-isn't it cool! Using the macro, i have taken close up pics of random materials like jeans and ribbon and you can see every stitch clearly. I can't get over how fantastic it is! Plus, with 14mega-pixels, there is no doubt in getting the maximum detail in every picture you snap at. I would definately recommend this camera!|#|2. The actual turn-on of the camera is speedy, but then it doesn't let you take a picture for another 3/4 seconds. Could be inconvenient when trying to catch an unforgettable moment etc.
5.0|#|Size.|#|Zoom juts out in 2 jerky steps, not smooth at all. Surprised this made it passed quality control and for that price, it was a very disappointing purchase. Ended up swapping for the Panasonic TZ7 which was the same price.
9.0|#|The camera is very easy to use; great picture quality and the optical zoom is fantastic for such a small camera (although my next purchase might well be a small tripod). The scene options are also excellent, setting the camera up to take shots in a variety of conditions is very quick and easy.|#|The comparative lack of manual controls could limit flexibility for specialist use. I normally use an SLR but  purchased the Nikon, which because of its size, is very useful for everday use. I now find, however, I am using it more and more as an alternative camera.
8.0|#|Small light and compact, easy one click point and shoot, impressive zoom for such a small camera, image quality great for home use and small flyer size prints, very responsive especially in good light, plenty of different shooting modes,|#|Button spacing only suitable for small fingers, takes several seconds to switch modes (as opposed to my old Nikon Coolpix which had a scene selector dial),  image stabilisation not perfect and doesn't always work, no case, no memory card, pop up flash (badly) located on top of camera which is a natural position for left hand index finger which can then prevent flash from popping up but you do get a warning and camera does not trigger when taking a shot which can then be missed, pop up flash as opposed to built into front of camera, panoramic scene does not auto detect edges so very difficult to line up scene for shots.
10.0|#|The camer is very lightweight and small considering the size of the lense|#|the internal memory isnt very big
9.0|#|Excellent picture quality.  Good zoom.  Very easy to operate - I think Nikons are the best.  Auto focus is incredibly fast.  Startup is 3 seconds, but the screen is displaying image immediately so you can start preparing the shot.  Battery life is good.  I took it on holiday and took 200 photos and some video and two weeks later I still haven't charged it up yet!|#|It's not a small as I'd hoped (but then it does have a 10x zoom).  Its 2cm longer than my old Coolpix 5200 which makes it feel much larger in your pocket.
9.0|#|Fantastic camera all round. Good enough for the experienced photographer who doesn't want to carry larger SLR type cameras, and for the novice, there's  enough features to get impressive photo's with little photography knowledge. The S8000's Panorama feature and the supplied Panorama Maker software is great to use. And with sharp images from the Macro mode, there's so much fun to be had for the novice.|#|None I've found so far.
9.0|#|Zoom range is fantastic|#|Auto focus doesn't pick up properly every time
10.0|#|Without doubt the best comact camera i have owned or used. It has almost no shutter lag meaning you get the picture you want. It has some nice features that, with a little practice, mean you can take pictures that will rival even an SLR. Battery life if very impressive and the flash recharge time is also great. The LCD screen is bright, crystal clear and easy to view even in bright sunlight. I would highly recommend this camera.|#|No bad points at all.
9.0|#|easy to use, compact, battery lasts for ever, the pictures are simply fantastic|#|1 bad thing, the flash pops up just where your fingers are while taking photo
7.0|#||#|no opportunity to view subject any other way than through monitor which is difficult in bright daylight
8.0|#|quick turn on|#|No handbook other than on line version
10.0|#|Great sharp pictures, has a frame freeze to help with movements also a `smile` detector! The large screen is good for viewing  what you have taken. It is compact and light weight for a camera of this quality, close ups are particularly good.|#|You can only see what you are taking through the large screen which is the only downside of the camera, as the reflection prevents you seeing the view.
10.0|#|10x Zoom and image quality especially.|#|The flash is sited where it is likely to to held.

7.0|#|easy to handle|#|flash pops up where it feels natural to hold the camera - therefore I find my left index finger is always holding the flash down
8.0|#|Picture quality is excellent and the visible appearance of camera is very stylish|#|The positioning of the flash is very poor and I can only anticiapte that the the flash will be damaged due to its poor location, so I strong recommend that designers consider this when redesigning a replacement model.

7.0|#|It is good to hold and takes good pictures|#|The flash shutter is placed where you naturally put your finger to hold the camera, so initially you have to get used to holding the camera so you don't obstrucy the flash when it opens
10.0|#|A great camera, as I would expect from Nikon.|#|
9.0|#|Compact, easy to carry - important if you engage in outdoor activites such as walking or mountain biking.  Excellent picture quality for the size of the camera.  Works reasonably well in lower light situations.  I'm still learning how to use it to get the best out of the camera in various conditions.  There are lots of scene modes, and sometimes in real situations it is not always clear which one will be best.|#|No really bad points, but you may need to change your usual method of holding the camera to avoid the pop up flash.  Once you get used to this there is no problem.
9.0|#|Excellent little camera. Ideal for stowing in your back pack when out and about. Easy to use, great snaps and great value.|#|Bad point is only a small gripe. Flash pop up is in an awkward spot when taking a pic but you soon learn how to hold this camera to combat the problem. Also battery life isn't as good as some cameras.

Get used to the more manual options and this is where it comes into it's own.

9.0|#|Value for money is amazing. The camera is light, and small, with a big enough screen to see what you're doing. I'm a student and use it on nights out, so it is absolutely perfect for what I need it for.|#|I find myself comparing it to the image quality of my SLR. Obviously it is going to be nowhere near that good, but sometimes (I don't know if it's me being a snob) the pictures appear a little grainy, but all in all, I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend.

9.0|#|Photo quality is excellent and the multiple features make it easy to get a good picture once you find your way round them, but this doesn't take too long.  Also had great images on spur of the moment clicks on the auto setting.  Comfortable to use, sits well in your hand.  Gorgeous rich colour of camera body, makes a nice change from silver or black!|#|Nothing - just wish I'd bought it sooner!
10.0|#|Very easy to use, with clear menu,  and large screen.  Perfect size in the hand. Quality photos too!|#|Miss the fact that it doesnt have a  view finder as well as the screen!! I always had old 35mm cameras so this is a personal thought!!

She has taken the Nikon to see groups at gigs and recorded them on the camera video. Works reasonably well for a camera of this category.|#|None as yet

9.0|#|Could do with being a bit larger in size.|#|none.
10.0|#|I would highly recommend this product, the main reason I chose the nikon was because I liked how small and lightweight it was, it has surprised me with such great quality!|#|It seems to take a couple of seconds in between shots, but I think that's pretty standard with compact cameras.
8.0|#|movies|#|doesn't come with a memory card
8.0|#|lightweight with great picture quality.  Good features.|#|Touchscreen controls take some getting used to.  Delay after taking photo can be quite long before next shot can be taken.  Would recommend getting a case as it's small size / black finish makes it a bit more delicate / suceptable to scratching etc
10.0|#|Very easy to use. Metal body very sturdy. Touch screen very responsive. Highly recommend this camera.|#|Have not found any.
9.0|#|Perfect size to fit in your pocket, touch screen is easy to use and responsive, power up is quick, auto focus is slick, meaning youare ready to take photo's quickly.  Image quality is great.  Battery life seems great so far.|#|Zoom control is a little fiddly being placed on the same button for taking the photo and sometimes a little too responsive when trying to get the right level of zoom.  Once you get past the optical zoom and into the digital zoom, the pictures can become a little grainy, but overall not a big thumbs down.
1.0|#|Good build quality and features|#|You need to press the focus button on average 10 times to get the picture in to focus; this is very annoying and having brought the camera to capture spontaneous pictures of our new baby totally unacceptable.

6.0|#|It's small and compact. The picture quality is good of you're not taking close up shots.|#|I hate the touch screen and the focus is terrible.
9.0|#||#|Only bad point I have found, is, if you have a slightly un-steady hand (like me) while taking pictures, it can come out a little blury. But if you have a steady hand or a tripod, then no problem. Would recommend this camera

9.0|#|Its very compact, fits in your back pocket.  The Auto Scene selector is a great point and shoot feature.  The touch screen and scroll through to view pictures is very cool. Lets you edit pictures with funny characters and frames.  Lovely colour.  You can touch the screen on the object you want to focus on.|#|I hate the fact that the manual is on a computer disk, would much rather have a paper copy.
9.0|#|Really slick little camera, which is very pretty. The touch screen is really good and easy to use. All the features and modes are easy to find and work out and some of the light settings really help make a picture good. I am not much of a photographer but I think it is brilliant for everyday use and extremely easy to use, and looks lovely.|#|Can't think of any.

5.0|#|Great little camera|#|had to take two back for exchange due to faults
9.0|#|Great little camera, I bought this for my daughter to replace her old Fuji.  I picked the Nikon specifically because I recently bought the s8000 and the image quality was the best I have ever experienced from a compact camera.  I can't vouch on the image quality of the s4000 but I know my daughter is just as picky, and has had nothing but good things to say about this little thing.|#|W pictures on the fly - she has to convert them after they have been taken.  I say tough, get used to it! ;)
9.0|#|Easy to use, good quality pics, excellent features, well built, compact|#|None really, I bought this  as a point and shoot camera to keep in my pocket  on a day or night out and it is perfect .
9.0|#|I bought this for my technologically challenged mother as I had heard some good reviews and it was being sold for a good price on J essops website.  It's very easy to use, she's nearly got the hang of it.  It took me about 2 minutes to get used to how it works.  The image quality is good, and it's nice and small so can fit in handbags, clutchbags, pockets.|#|Nothing so far - if I was pushed to mention a bad point  I may say that due to the dinky size of the camera, and its light weight, I sometimes worry it might slip out of my hand.  Comes with a wrist strap though... tick!
9.0|#|Bought it for the wife who got it straight out the box and took a photo without reading the instructions. Thats just great for general use and days out. No fussyness just ppoint and shoot.|#|None yet

10.0|#|I find it very easy to use, and it is a lovely small size to fit into a small handbag.  I've always liked Nikon, and never had any problem with their cameras in the past, so hopefully this will be great, as it is so far. Well worth the money.|#|None

10.0|#|I purhcased for a birthday present for a teenager.  Its great she keeps it in her school bag so its has to be quite robust!  She snaps away at every opportunity so it has to react fast.  The pictures are great for a low cost camera.|#|Not found any yet.

6.0|#|It is slim compact camera with good image capture quality.  It has easy to understand symbols and the name Nikon stands out as a quality camera.|#|It is a good quality camera for the price.  Expectation are always high but it has to be related to to the cost price.
2.0|#|It looks good and has good movie quality.|#|The lighting settings are useless in bad lighting and the camera doesn't react well with night time lighting ir when theres lights in the pictures.
1.0|#||#|Image quality was disappointing when I  tried it out.  I have a Nikon DX40 which is infinitely superior.  Of course I don't expect a digital compact to be of the same quality as a digital SLR but I expected something better form the Nikon brand.
1.0|#||#|VERY DISAPPOINTING, as I have this same model and mine has worked perfectly from the beginning
10.0|#|Super lightweight, perfect 'evening bag' size, very easy to operate and easy to view pictures.  Very easy to download the pics to the computer, took no time at all.  Didn't want a complicated camera with loads of features I wouldn't ever use - this does exactly what it says on the tin and I am delighted with it.|#|Just a pity it doesn't come with a memory card as you can't take masses of pictures without one, but it's not the end of the world and won't put me off buying it again!
10.0|#|good for the money|#|none
8.0|#|The best thing is the fact it has Li-ion battery included with charger so no need to keep buying batteries or using rechargables.|#|A little bit plasticy, but nowhere near as bad as some of the cheaper or for that matter more expensive models.

8.0|#|i is  a  very tidy compact and very silent|#|you have to put the  disc into the computer to read the instruction book
9.0|#|I've been looking for a compact camera to take everywhere with me and the Nikon P7000 immediately appealed to me as a serious photographer by giving me full access to all the facilities I take for granted on my big Nikons. Great image quality for this size of sensor, 10 MP is more than enough. Excellent screen ans build quality compared to the rather fragile compacts.|#|Add on wide-angle lens adapter is expensive and the supplied carrying strap is too big for the size of the camera - I used a wrist strap instead.
9.0|#|Even better value at the reduced price|#|

9.0|#|bought this for my 16 year old son as he was very fortunate to gain a place on a trip to India. With no photographic experience at all he came home with over 400 images most of which are clear, correctly exposed, both indoors and outside and in focus. sent him with energiser ultimate lithium batteries and one set more than coped with this number of pictures. excellent value for the money paid|#|the usual gripe with lower priced digital cameras over the time delay between pressing the shutter and the picture being taken. focusing when taking 'grab' shots can be a bit hit and miss, probably failing to get the feel for depressing the shutter release half way to focus before pressing the rest of the way to take the picture. in more experienced hands this would probably not be a problem though.
10.0|#|very easy to use.|#|none
9.0|#|Good size and weight. Nice to hold and looks and feels well made. Like the fact that it runs on batteries as it's easy to carry a couple of spares so no worries about recharging. Macro facility is great for close ups. Good all round camera.|#|Nothing major. Downloading on computer was a bit confusing at first but soon got hang of it.
10.0|#|Amazing value for a 14mp Nikon. If you wand a good little point and shoot camera, with fantastic results, then don't be lashing hundreds out on a camera with features you don't understand and will never use.|#|I am a pro photographer so I could go on a bit, but for what I paid for a pocket, quality camera I will spare you the sermon. Cant really find any bad points. I knew exactly what I was buying.
9.0|#|AA Batteries: I mulled over the ordinary batteries as a negative facility but now decide you do not have to carry a heavy charger and can buy AA batteries in every High Street and a spare pair in the pocket is not cumbersome.|#|Whilst it has a tripod screw I miss a shoe for the new 12-LED Manfrotto all-over illumination to avoid flash at parties. You have to put in a lot of learning time but overall I hope this is going to prove my most capable all-round pocket camera.

4.0|#|Cheap for a Nikon-badged product.  As a point-and-shoot camera it is simple to use and produces good images.  With Ni-MH rechargeables, battery life is very good (with ordinary Alkaline it is appalling).  I normally use a professional quality digital SLR but for occasions when it is not possible to have that camera with me I wanted a cheap backup camera that was a notch or two above my mobile phone in image quality, but still small enough to slip into a pocket.  Bar the problem mentioned below it has fulfilled that aim.|#|As many others have doubtless reported, after a month or so of use the battery door latch became insecure and is liable to pop open without warning.  I have resorted to a couple of elastic bands just to stop the batteries from falling on the floor when taking a photo.  Some clever people have devised mods, details of which can be found on the web, but as this camera was only ever intended for occasional use, I have lived with the problem.

Can select a lower megapixel value such as 8 or 5 to save on memory! incredible value for money, great little point and shoot when you dont want to lug around your dslr|#|lots of grain even at iso 80 in low light conditions. not so great indoors, flash needed. touchscreen is a nightmare at times! all that said, well worth the investment.

It's fantastic value for a point and shoot.|#|Personally, I'd rather have a comprehensive instuction booklet than a CD to read via my computer; it would enable me to browse functions at leisure, rather than screen reading.

10.0|#|Very easy to pick up and use, lovely clear images, still getting used to it but so far  Im happy|#|
10.0|#|This camera is great, it produces high quality images but also lets you lower the resolution (very useful if you're taking an image with the desire to e-mail it etc right away). You can edit on the camera, re-size, black and white and adjust colour which is very useful and also good fun and the image saves as a back up so you never loose your original image. Images can also be altered in certain 'scenes' before you take them which is brilliant for landscape images. Overall, a really high quality camera which you can print large images (up to around A3). It stand up beautifully against my collection of both digital and film SLRs and cameras.|#|

8.0|#|Good sized LCD display, very good lens and zoom.|#|No case supplied.
9.0|#|Very easy to use - not bothered about digital camera's up until now - mainly because I now wear reading glasses and find it a nuisance having to put on glasses before I can start to take photos, but the screen is a good size which makes it easier.|#|Touch screen - too many fingerprints makes my already fuzzy focus more fuzzy.

10.0|#|Fab camera, great price, easy to use and takes great pics. Esp like the photo editing section. Very easy to work and after a little playing soon had all different settings/functions worked out - almost no need for instructions! Love the ability to take pics just by touching the screen too. Like the fact that the mains charger is also the usb cable for picture downloads - limits amounts of cables to look after! Got a 4g memory card in so can take lots of pics|#|Would prefer it if lens closed when veiwing pics as did on previous camera but only a small bugbear.

Definitely worth every penny.|#|Only fault is it is slightly heavy but what can one expect with all the good features it has. Then again its still lighter and more compact than an SLR.
8.0|#|This camera is for auto use only and the few simple scene modes make picture taking so easy. If you want manual control this is not the camera for you. The video is great. Controls are intuitive. Easy to handle.  Long zoom is a bonus. Point and shoot at a great price.|#|720p video looks great. Not sure yet how sensitive the microphone is. Not the best at focusing. Make sure to check the image has focused properly on the screen. It does, but you must make sure on closer images.
8.0|#|Bought this camera for a trip to New York - havent been yet but have been using it and getting used to features etc. plenty of different options - even a pet potrait setting - the smile detector is also good fun. Excellent zoom, pictures are very clear. can have a slight problem with shake at max zoom, but only occasionally. like the fact it uses aa batteries as it means i can have 2 sets and wont run out if using the whole day. Pictures take quickly - hate cameras that take ages to take the picture after you press shoot. some reviews say it doesnt work well in low light, i have found that the pictures come out pretty well in low light. overall good camera for general use.|#|have to push a button for flash to pop up - not automatic, but not a real problem

10.0|#|Purchased this for my father-in-law as I knew how simply Nikon cameras are.  We have three Nikon Coolpix cameras (of various specs) in our household and they are great.  The L21 is very easy to use and produces good quality pictures.  If all you want is to point and shoot and not have complicated menus, then you can't go wrong with this.|#|None.
10.0|#|Very simple to use. Battery consumption is not excessive (compared to previous camera owned)|#|None discovered so far.
10.0|#|Very compact and very easy to use, both for still photos and short movies. The camera batteries seem to last well too. Ideal if you want to be able to take good quality photos without spending hours learning how to use the camera, but more advanced features are available if you want them.|#|None.
10.0|#|We bought this for our 6 year old daughter.  It appears to be good quality and its nice and straight forward to use.  Pictures are good as well.  Really pleased and would recommend.|#|Doesn't come with a case, which is needed.
9.0|#|Easy to use, good image quality, fits in your pocket and one set of batteries lasted a whole week of holiday!|#|Shutter delay - but in compacts there will always be a delay between pressing the button and the shutter firing. The delay is better than other compact cameras I've used though.
9.0|#|Easy to use.|#|
9.0|#|Great easy starter camera - does all the basics very well and is small enough to not clutter up your pockets.|#|You will need to buy a memory card to accompany the compact
1.0|#|EAsy to use in some cases.|#|Mine gave me problems from the start, i bought two, my sister's one is fair but my one is absolutely a tragedy.It ruined my christmas, i couldn't take any clear picture and nobody could set it.
10.0|#|The pictures are clear, and it is very easy to use and i can record and also set it and place it on a high object and take a picture of myself|#|
9.0|#|Highly recommend you consider this as a starter camera for the young (or old!) or just a good value stand in when the larger camera just doesn't fit in the bag!|#|None so far. Would be nice to have had a case included, but we found a decent one for a fiver anyway.
10.0|#|SO MANY POSITVES FOR THIS CAMERA I LOVE IT !!|#|the only negative comment i could make is that sometimes...only sometimes.. the camera takes a few seconds to take the photo, but i understand that this is because it is trying to recognise the faces as it places a box around them! really recommend this camera!
9.0|#|Brilliant in every way.build.looks.picture.easy to use.touchscreen is very good.to be honest the best compact camera I.ve had yet.and I.ve had a lot.love my gadgets.if you get an opportunity to buy one.buy a 4150 you won.t be disappointed.|#|None!
9.0|#|Bought camera for my partner who isn't clued up on camera's. Needed good point and shoot camera that delivered good photos. I have always bought Nikon for myself(DSLR) so followed suit when buying a compact. Good features, easy to use. Would reccommend.|#|Been in use most days and no bad points.
10.0|#|good photo quality, excellent  features, easy to carry (by size)|#|
9.0|#|Very easy to use, good picture quality, video making quite good as well when I first got it I took me mom's picture in the kitchen in normal white kitchen light but the I was amazed with the quality of the picture and the screen resolution on the camera is better then other cameras in the market in the same price range, I have iPhone from such a long time since I have this bad habit of Touch screen but with this camera all the eggs in one basket a complete package is here.|#|Nothing so far, complete satisfaction for what I paid for......

10.0|#|It's really easy to use, works well in the light and dark, and takes good quality pictures.|#|The internal memory is ridiculously small (only 4 pictures can be taken on the settings it originally comes preset on), so a memory card has to be bought with it.

9.0|#|We took evening shots on a ferry without flash and the camera was hand held...the image was sharp and recognisable. Standard photos are sharp crisp and clean. Colour rendition is great.|#|
9.0|#|I saw it was Which?'s best buy camera and they were spot on. Fantastic product and fairly priced, given what else is out there.|#|It annoys me that cameras don't come with a cover (even a basic cloth one) to protect the screen at the back!
9.0|#|Full manual control when you want it, but ease of point and shoot when you don't.|#|Some of the really zoomed in image detail sharpness is lost due to the camera trying to be a bit too clever than it's capable of being.  But I'm being very nit picky, and could probably adjust it if I can be bothered to delve into the settings menu.
9.0|#|Internal memory (limited) in case you forget to put in a card|#|No external mains charger supplied in box - battery has to be charged in the camera via USB. Nikon charger expensive (£30+)  but I got a third party one for £17. Spare battery expensive but third party ones available and just as good
9.0|#|Excellent quality, especially on night shots. Also HD movie looked brilliant on HDTV.|#|Lots of options. Almost too many to begin with.

9.0|#||#|It doesn't produce raw NEF files, but then again it is a compact and not like my dSLR
10.0|#|This Nikon point and shoot is an excellent camera, well made and produces very good photos and videos. Having looked at other similar  cameras which were more expensive I chose this and am very pleased with my purchase and I like the Nikon brand having one of their dslrs too. I would recommend the Coolpix P300 as a step up to a dslr, it has plenty of features for a small camera and should keep any budding photographer happy.|#|None so far.

9.0|#|It takes excellent photos. Is slimline so doesn't take up a lot of space in a bag or pocket. Easy to use. Looks good.|#|Because it's slimline it can be a bit fiddly to hold and use for adult hands, even for a woman's small hands, the downside of having a camera that is compact. The opening cover for the connector cable is very flimsy and could do with being stronger. Mechanism for zooming is tricky to use because it is so tiny and looks as though it could easily break.
9.0|#|nice and small very compact u dont have to do a separate chargin on the battery u leave it in the camera and c harge.|#|
8.0|#|Great that it will take short movies as well as good stills. Easy to use and tons of features|#|Need to hold it very still to avoid blur, and the lanyard must be used to prevent it slipping out of you hands.

Wife, who is new to photography loves it and I'm pretty impressed too!|#|none at this price.

10.0|#|The camera is very small and compact which makes it a brilliant choice for my future travelling plans. The colour is very attractive and looks like a more expensive camera than it actually is. The image quality is on top form, and when pictures are printed they are crisp and clear. the camera is easy to use and even without reading the manual i was able to navigate my way around the various menus to set up my camera to perform at its highest level. different scenes make it a good choice for those who want to use the camera for a number of purposes eg outside scenery, sports events, partys etc. The choice of adding a memory card is good and ive added a 4GB SDHC card which allows 505 pictures on setting 12mp*|#|althought the image quality is of a good standard, the only thing i would point out is that the flash can only be used on auto or off completely. the picture quality is good without the flash but someones it would be a lot better with the flash.with the camera being small and compact it is a shame you do not recieve a protective case, as my sister has in the past. i would recommend a hard case as they are robust and good for travelling with your camera. i also bought a spare battery as it takes a Nikon EN-EL10, not the standard AA
10.0|#|It is very compact. Easy to use. Really good images. Focus very clear. Really pleased.|#|

9.0|#|anyone can use this camera to take good pictures even my wife, the macro picyures ive taken are v good ive had two of them blown up to A2 and they are crystal clear with no pixalation|#|setting the white balence is esential if you want true colours in your picture, you have to have a tripod even for just half zoom (analog)
10.0|#|Easy to handle, very good macro and zoom.  Simple menus. One touch HD video recording.  All the settings, preset and manual you will ever need.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|Great at zooming and steady enough for my shaky hand|#|
9.0|#|Overall this has been an exceptional value-for-money purchase.|#|The only slight disappointment is the narrow range of f stops when working manually. I would have hoped for something smaller than f8. I was also slightly disappointed not being able to view and take photos in sepia. I can do this on my Nikon pocket digital for a fraction is the price. Apart from these two minor issues not found anything to concern me yet though I've not really tried the video function yet.
10.0|#|Best camera I've purchased to date - It takes pictues like professionals - possibly better !|#|can't think of any - Great camera and great price
10.0|#|its 26X is most useful, no need for another lens.  It is a light camera and with a lot of useful features to play around with! In short, very glad I bought it as the 800 photos I took in Turkey recently came out brilliant.|#|One definitely need a stand when using the digital zoom.

9.0|#|Large screen,18X zoom, compact size and weight, well built. Menu systems easy to follow and makes the camera very versatile, Sharp results from the lens.|#|Not really bad points - getting used to the monitor and holding the camera steady whilst viewing - I have always used a camera with an eye level viewfinder until now. The screen is difficult to see in strong sunlight conditions - maybe my poor eyesight to blame!
9.0|#|Anyone can take great pictures and video with this camera and if I could have my money back Id buy this Nikon again. At this price point its a winner.|#|If youre a total amateur then youll not 'know' when to use the flash; it isnt automatic and if the camera demands it by an on-screen message you have to flip a little button on the side to raise the flash. There are only a few settings to play with so if you want to be more creative then this might not be the one for you, but I prefer to manipulate my photos after theyve been taken. Charging the battery is done in-camera so a spare one is a must although you can buy a  seperate charger. Not really a fault of the camera but when shooting HD video the max file time is 29 minutes, this is a limitation of the FAT file system, so you just press 'record' again.
8.0|#|A compact,  well built solid feeling camera, with a fantastic zoom range. Lens and image quality well up to Nikon standards. Generally easy to use, with a wide range of automatic settings and scene modes (though see bad points for a cuple of areas that let it down a little.

2.0|#|image quality was on a par with the lumix panasonic cameras that I regularly purchase and recommend. the long zoom range and the nikon reputation for quality prompted me to switch brands on this occasion.|#|it is very bad policy for a manufacturer to attempt to capitalise on its reputation without ensuring that every badged product lives up to the standards associated with the name. In this case, Nikon have obviously given the design and manufacture of this consumer-grade point-and-shoot to some lowly subsidiary, without access to the design and production know-how expressed in the fine standard of their professional cameras, which I have bought and used in forty years as a professional photographer. How else could Nikon conceivably be selling a camera that does not automatically tag each image with the metadata which will turn it to the right orientation when imported to any of the standard image-editing applications. The last time I spent unhappy minutes manually rotating images so they were correctly oriented was.. about ten years ago!! wake up at the back there!!!

10.0|#||#|The only time you're going to struggle to take an image, like with most cameras is in low light, although the choice of flash is good enough that if you get the time before taking the image to test out which flash is best you can get similar warm tones to if you hadn't have used the flash at all!

6.0|#||#|Picture is not very sharp, you get blured edges. Had better cameras with less pixel
7.0|#||#|My phone makes picture better.
10.0|#|The camera is small enough just to slip into your pocket. Image quality is good, and the camera looks and feels good, too. Just to polish it off, the battery lasts a good while- I bought the product sometime ago, and although I only take a picture here and there, the battery has lasted and I haven't had to pull out the charger since it was new.|#|None that I have encountered so far.
9.0|#|Basically I love this camera and we have taken some great shots with it straight out of the box.  Highly recommended.|#|Video taken inside has overly warm hues.  Also, the video is in VGA rather than HD.  I prefer VGA because it makes for smaller files and  I'm normally just shooting 10 minutes of the cat doing something funny.  But if your cat has star quality I guess you might want HD.
9.0|#|Brought for my mum (65+) as a gift to convert her to digital. found easy to use (after getting manual) took on holiday and now she's converted.

8.0|#|Small, light and good colours|#|While I haven't used it that much yet, I have found that it sometimes reacts slowly when taking a picture in low light. As if it has to think about how to use the flash. But apart from that this is a nice little camera and good value for the money.

At 12mp it takes up to five seconds to save the image to my 1gb sd card and won't take another shot in the meantime. 3s at 8mp. It's quite irritating when you press shoot and nothing happens.

10.0|#|Easy to clean lens when covered in sun cream or sand|#|Menus could be better organised to alter settings.
7.0|#|Good HDR video, panorama and macro features.  Other novelties include a backlighting setting which does a type of HDR for which I think a tripod is requird.  I bought it as it can be carried in a shirt pocket and is robust enough for every day use in all weathers and on a beach.  It does not have manual control but a good range of presets for all situations.|#|A 'What Digital Camera' review marked it down for difficulty of using the controls underwater but I don't intend to do that and find the controls easy to operate.  I think that Nikon should not have tried to make it 16 megapixels with such a small sensor - ten would have been better. Image quality was praised in the 'What Digital Camera' review and this was why I selected this model. No doubt it costs more to make the camera rugged and fit all the moving parts inside the camera where they are out of reach of sand and water.  However this may mean less is spent on the optics.  The optical quality is good for a small compact but don't expect it to compare with a top of the range model like a Canon Powershot G12 which is about twice the price.  I can see why mountaineers might like to record their GPS location but it's not a feature I would use and it shortens battery life.  A sliding dust shield for the lens might have been useful.

4.0|#|small, compact and very tough and the only thing going for this camera is it's textured shutter button.|#|I do alot of photography and have done so over the past 15years and this is the most disappointing 'point and shot' camera with a specific purpose.

7.0|#|Good HDR video, panorama and macro features.  Other novelties include a backlighting setting which does a type of HDR for which I think a tripod is requird.  I bought it as it can be carried in a shirt pocket and is robust enough for every day use in all weathers and on a beach.  It does not have manual control but a good range of presets for all situations.|#|A 'What Digital Camera' review marked it down for difficulty of using the controls underwater but I don't intend to do that and find the controls easy to operate.  I think that Nikon should not have tried to make it 16 megapixels with such a small sensor - ten would have been better. Image quality was praised in the 'What Digital Camera' review and this was why I selected this model. No doubt it costs more to make the camera rugged and fit all the moving parts inside the camera where they are out of reach of sand and water.  However this may mean less is spent on the optics.  The optical quality is good for a small compact but don't expect it to compare with a top of the range model like a Canon Powershot G12 which is about twice the price.  I can see why mountaineers might like to record their GPS location but it's not a feature I would use and it shortens battery life.  A sliding dust shield for the lens might have been useful.

This is a go anywhere camera that gives you quality photos on the move without having to carry all the gear.The quality of the photograpgs is second to none and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality digital compact camera.|#|Like most digital camera suppliers, no SD card included in the bundle so you cant use it until you buy one.

10.0|#|Suburb quality product throughout. Solid construction. Easy to use with loads of great features. I've always had compact digital camera's as I'm not a photography expert but fancied something better quality. I didn't want a full blown SLR so opted for the Nikon J1. Really impressed with the step up from a standard compact digital. This is a brilliant camera that bridges the gap between compact digital and SLR camera's without being too fancy and serious. Highly recommended|#|Although it is small compared to SLR's it's probably quite a bit bigger than your standard compact digital camera, especially with the detachable lens. This isn't a bad point as such, it just takes a little getting used to.

The panorama is one of the best but unfortunately the designers have built in a cut off when the camera is out of exposure range range. Shurely this is for the photographer to decide.   Most annoying: if you do not want to take video why do we have to tolerate half the screen filled with info

10.0|#|It is so easy to use! I had an older version of Nikon Coolpix, which was easy to use, but the menu on this model is even more intuitive. Record button and timer function are made perfectly as you don't have to go to the menu and look for these, instead they are clearly visible and require just one movement of your finger. Fits perfectly into my jeans pocket. Easy to use. Quality is good, some photos can be blurred, but this is the same with all little cameras. If standing still and in good light, quality is almost the same like with my professional Nikon camera. I am very happy overall.|#|I don't particularly like the black colour. I had a red Nikon Coolpix earlier and i think that red is so much more elegant for this camera. It's just my opinion, but black does not compliment this little camera as well as red or silver. Maybe it is just my feminine opinion:)

A really good camera for the price, it does not disappoint!|#|Not really a negative, but I bought it with a twin lens kit, (18 - 55 Nikon lens and 70 - 55 Tamron lens).  The Tamron lens does NOT have VR, maybe a good lens, but I bought a Nikon 55-300 a/f VR lens (which can be bought for £169.00). This has proven to be an excellent lens and the one I use most and with the D3200 has taken some lovely shots.
10.0|#|An excellent choice for the beginner or more experienced photographer alike. The camera setting allow for almost any situation and the resulting images are brilliant. The standard kit lens allows for a wide enough range of images, however the Tamron 70-300 VC lens is a very useful bit of kit too likewise enabling great images. Coupled with the 24 mega pixel sensor the results are very professional looking.|#|I haven't found any yet. I have added a ML-L3 remote as an additional purchase. Should really have come with the camera bundle though.
9.0|#|I cannot comment on good points as I am not really good enough but I will say that it is an excellent camera compared to my old Bridge camera. I have used a Bridge camera for some years and always wanted a DSLR for better pictures.

10.0|#|Very good quality camera for a reasonable price|#|None
10.0|#|Its a really good DSLR for the money and the VR lens is great if you've not got the most steady hand.

Overall, it is not a bad AF algorithm, its just that Sony's is better and I was used to that.

One good feature is that you can edit and crop a photo on board and save the edited photo and keep the original and as the photo is 18 megapixels the quality of both photos is excellent.|#|The second bad point is that to use the wireless capability you need the optional Nikon wireless mobile adaptor (WU-1a) this will set you back about £50.

The first one lasted for about 4yrs and I have used it in many countries as I travel alot. The camera is very durable, but be very careful not to expose it to sandstorms, especially in the desert. That's how my first Nikon Coolpix got damaged.|#|None!
9.0|#|Takes much better indoor photos than my previous digital compact, this was my initial reason for changing. Also like the long zoom, the portrait and sports scene options are especially useful too. Eventually I hope to use the manual settings and understand how these all work - so this camera is great as a way to improve your photography without having to learn too much and go straight to a DSLR, Good size and not too heavy.|#|

I dove with it six times down to a max of 13 meters and got some great clear shots.|#|The only negative I can think of being that you you can't operate the menu buttons wearing dive gloves.  You need to take of one glove to do so.  That said it's not really a problem, more of an adjustment.
10.0|#|Easy to use. Great picture quality. Because it is 20 megapixel you can crop and expand any part of the picture and still have good picture quality. Compact and easy to carry in your pocket so it is always there when you need it.|#|Have not found any yet.

The shutter delay is very small and the 22x optical zoom is outstanding.|#|I don't like the placing of the pop-up flash gun, it sits just in the best place to put my fingers for a steady shot.  It doesn't come with a case which is disappointing for a high quality camera.

10.0|#|I can recommend selling everything that isnt bolted to the floor for this camera especially if youre like me someone who enjoys taking photos and really wants to capture a memory as it should be, this camera is amazing for the price, it again will be a number of years before I need to upgrade|#|It's still quite a heavy camera and no where to attach a shutter release cable, youre going to need a remote control or the remote lead
10.0|#|Excellent quality my 20th Nikon to date and by far the best image quality in digital, equalling that of Hasselblad on film|#|No capture NX included

10.0|#||#|I can't find any :)
9.0|#|The Nikon D300 is a sensational camera with the best handling and lowest image noise at high ISO that i've yet come across.|#|Slight concerns over intermittent battery contact and occasional focus hunting.
9.0|#|Everything - this is just an amazing all round camera. The pictures are stunning.|#|It is quite easy to knock the focus mode switch from Single Focus to Continuos Focus mode. Maybe it could have a little more resistance. I've moved this accidentally a few times without realising it.
9.0|#|Super high ISO quality, a step up from the D200,  built like a tank, go to weight training before buying, particularly if you use the MB-D10 grip and the pro f2.8 nikkor lenses like the 17-55 or 70-200. 8fps and a fast auto focus make this a dream sports camera. Although with so many settings it can be a different camera to different people.|#|For a inexperienced digital photographer this camera would be a nightmare, the very thing that makes it great for experienced users,i.e all the settings and modes, would have other users out of their depth. Not the camera to upgade to from say a compact digital.
10.0|#|Very fast RAW storage , ability to obtain great exposures with light and dark images in the same picture, exposures using high ISO rating are fantastic .. who needs a flash ?|#|
10.0|#||#|Cant think of any, except a hdmi lead included in the box would have been nice.
10.0|#|An amazing camera, though, as yet, I have not had chance to use it fully. Its functions are many and its level of automation spectacular. With this level of sophstication one cannot, with th best will in the world describe the camera as being very easy to use: though every effort has been made to make it so. All important controls are to hand without the need to delve into menus.|#|None

9.0|#|Step up from the D200 I traded for this body. Much better at low light (less noise). Focus much quicker - especially moving objects. Improved sensor makes a difference with less post processing required - colour etc captured well first time! Sensor cleaner seems to work (no spots yet!!). Liveview feature on larger screen very useful for macro work and taking shots at strange angles including holding high over the heads of crowds! Very pleased I upgraded.|#|D300 Raw images not supported by Adobe CS2. Had to buy Elements 6 to use the camera raw plug-ins. Other than that I can't fault it!! Gave 9 out of 10 because nothings perfect!
10.0|#|The exposure is just perfects, it nails any kind of scenario without problems in Matrix. Fast autofocus and 100% viewfinder. For the first time ever, a camera body that makes the difference in taking pictures. I passed from a D80 to the D300, skipping the 'fully-cool-feature-loaded-D90': if you don't care about movie and fancy stuff, and if you want a camera to take only pictures, but great pictures, get the D300 instead, it's really really worth the extra money.|#|Only few buttons are customizable, many others could be (it's a firmware thing, no?) but this doesn't compromise the ergonomy of the camera...
9.0|#|A significant upgrade from the D70 for me, far better metering and exposure control, far better real-life frames per second (as opposed to 'on paper'), so far I haven't really found anything to grumble about.|#|The supplied strap feels cheap an inadequate - I'll get an after-market replacement.  Overall price reflects novelty value at the moment as this is currently the semi-pro camera to beat, and really needs to come down another hundred.
9.0|#|Not a newbie to Nikon SLRs having owned a D100 and D70 in the past, the D300 had to have something over the 2 cameras and sure enough it had- the manual was twice as thick and features too many to mention but the most impt. thing was the sharper and better images from the improved focussing system that came out of the camera. If you can afford it, go for it. coupled with good glass and your imagination, you are away.|#|Not any I can think of
10.0|#|Better image quality than my D2X.  More professional like sealing than a D200 so usable in most weather conditions.|#|Don't like the large rubber covers for flash socket, USB connector etc., prefered the old style screw in caps of previous Nikons.
10.0|#|of focus plus just about everything else!|#|Clot behind viewfinder! (sometimes)
10.0|#|Outstanding digital SLR camera, Nikon have evolved their digital cameras over recent years, and although they were lagging behind a few years ago, they are now the market leaders, above all else. This camera produces a stunning image in all conditions. Highly recommended.|#|Battery life could be improved.
10.0|#||#|Literally none.
10.0|#|The idea that the D300 is a progression from the D200 is misleading. certainly it has much the same looks, but inside it is based on the new D3 and this is reflected in the all important image quality. Improved features abound, such as the 51-spot focus system, designed to better all previous products. If the D400 follows this trend I'll be tempted to upgrade every 2 years!|#|
10.0|#|Other good features is the zoom option and the high definition connection to the TV or computer|#|No bad points so far
10.0|#||#|The camera is quite heavy but seems balanced for handling. I think you need an extra instruction book to understand it. More information should be available from the manufacturer at the time of purchase.
10.0|#|All the above are features, but the most important benefit is excellent and sharp images.|#|with this camera; the shutter is loud, and putting it into continuous shoot mode will certainly attract attention..

10.0|#|Have great quality image and very good building quality. Complete, extremely versatile and it can be configure in many ways.  It is the best choice in its segment.|#|It is complex to operate initially.  However after getting familiar with it, the camera is a lot simple than a first sight.
9.0|#|Very solid piece of kit.|#|Should be issued with a video not a 400 page book......lots of tweeking to remember.
10.0|#|Fantastic image quality and noticeably better than the D200 in the way it handles colour saturation and highlights. Still has the normal superb Nikon build but add several features like the amazing screen, live view and 51 point focusing.|#|With so many functions and settings (the manual is over 400 pages!) you need to know how to use a camera to get the best from the D300.
10.0|#|Excellent camera.  Great build quality, one of the best aps camera's on the market today.  Full of features and a 100% view in the viewfinder.  Highly recommended.|#|

10.0|#|Handling of light in both low and high lighting situations is great.  It's a good sized camera so easily handled.  Features found on it are suitable for professionals/semi-pro's. Quality bit of kit.|#|No bad points regarding camera - only the strap is the most uncomfortable I've ever come accross!
9.0|#|Read the user guide, which is very well written and takes a couple of hours, and you'll know everything there is to know about this camera, including some good tips.|#|It's a good build quality, but perhaps not that of the Nikkon of old...
10.0|#|The camera just feels right; it fits one's hands perfectly, and feels realy balanced.  The large LCD screen makes viewing easy, even in bright light.  The focusing is as near perfect as i've ever seen, and the build quality is really good, as I would expect from Nikon.|#|Can't think of any!
10.0|#|Phenomenal camera - great value for money. Impossible to take a bad picture with this camera. Having used Canon's 5D in my opinion this produces better results. I use the VR 18-200mm lens with it which is perfect 95% of the time. Super responsive camera, ergonomincal styling which produces sharp, vivid pictures and even at high ISO the noise isn't bad. Very easy to use. Highly recommended!|#|haven't found any yet
10.0|#|I work as a wedding photographer and this camera knocks spots off my old Canon 30D, the quality of my photos are instantly better without adjustment. I often use iso 1600 now as it really is good on this camera.|#|Got the 16-85mm lens as well... Top quality optics but slower to focus on the D300 than I'm used to
9.0|#|Fantastic image quality straight out of camera.  Handling is so intuitive as expected for a nikon and focusing is quick and accurate.  Colours, dynamic range and noise are excellent.  Using this camera with top glass gives stunning results|#|Still a little overpriced (I paid £1000),  although SO glad I bought it!!!
10.0|#|Lots of gadgets and high quality images|#|A complex camera and have yet to try manual options.  It is heavier than my previous Nikon.  The 18 -200 mm lens is an excellent all rounder.

3.0|#|New Features and AF points|#|Pink and magenta skin tone, inconsistent. Underexposure at low light (mine does). Shutter sound very loud. Low Iso noise.
9.0|#|Fast AF, excellent image quality, solid build. A worthwhile upgrade from the D80 I had previously.|#|just a couple of observations really. If you're new to Nikon the menu system may take a little getting used to and the camera is also a little on the heavy side, you may not want to lug it around all day for casual shooting !

10.0|#|I have upgraded to a D300 from a D70 after a number of years good service. I had looked at the D90 as well, but chose the older D300 as it had more autofocus options, quicker frame rate and more solid construction. After just returning from holiday with around 6000 photos - I am happy that I made the decision and am looking forward to more serious use.|#|Compared to the D70 it is in another league - soo nothing to compare about.
10.0|#|Fantastic build quality and superb photo quality. Really good LCD screen and very little noise at high ISOs. Not hard to use if you are familiar with the D200. Few changes to controls and layout. At last Nikon have replaced the pull off port covers with rubber covers permanently attached to the body.

9.0|#|The best thing about the D5100 is the range of features available for the price - I use the camera with a Rode Videomic for filming interviews and live performances, and the 1080p mode (especially with 20mins recording) has totally outperformed anything else from a DLSR I've seen at this price range. The camera itself is a very good introduction to DSLR camera features and you get plenty for the money.|#|The D5100 is a bit like having a slightly more placticy D90 with a few awkward buttons and lacking a monocrome display.

10.0|#|Nice, small, entry level DSLR with very good picture quality.(It's shares the same sensor as Nikon D7000). I use it most time with lens 35mm and it gets fantastic results. Could carry with me all the time. For proper holding I use the grip. If you don't need to access to the fast controls this is an excellent example of DSLR camera. I also have D90 camera but mostly use this D5100 as it smaller and produce same high quality pictures.|#|Video focusing quite noisy and luggy. Would recommend you manual focusing instead.

The ability to take quite good photos in poor lighting conditions came in very useful early on - particularly as I'd paid over £30 for a specialised photo shoot with a group of photographers.|#|Having to switch lenses either side of 55mm can be irritating. You really do have to choose a wide angle (under 55mm)  or telephoto (over 55mm)  before you line up a shot. My previous SLR camera had a full 28 - 200mm range in a single lens.

Having all the exposure details in the display makes setting up a shot easy for someone like myself who wears glasses.

9.0|#|magazines before buying this camera for my wifes birthday, and it Just does what it says on the can. Just make sure you shop around for the best deal. Prices for this camera do come with big differences. Also check with the nikon web site for cash back deals as well.This is my own personal view, but i do not think it is worth spending extra money on the Nikon D 40X, I have friend who has bought this upgrade but we both say you can't tell the diffrence between my 6 mil pixcells and his 10 mil pixcells.|#|I think Nikon's range of camera bags are very limited / poor,i could not find a a good nikon case for this camera which suited. Shame i had to buy a unbranded product to put this D40 in.
9.0|#|Easy to use - in fact, my wife fell in love with it on our recent holiday and ended up taking most of the pictures! But still has enough 'advanced' features for all but the most hardened professional. Image quality excellent with the kit lens, impressive performance at low light levels. A major step up from a compact digital. Overall, I'm glad I bought it.|#|A little bulky to carry around, but all SLRs have that problem. This is outweighed by the fact that people are impressed by your abilities as a photographer (even if you don't have any!)
10.0|#|Excellent picture quality with no loss at very high magnification levels A3 no problems at all. Possible to take out of the box and use without reading the book!|#|Need to read the book to get the most out of the camera!
10.0|#|It's easy to get the hang of it, feels nice in your hands and has image quality that is on par with other digital cameras twice its price. What more do you want?|#|None
10.0|#|A very well built camera for its size and price and ideal for someone looking for a start in photography. The kit lens is excellent and produces very clear images. Clarity is fantastic and the fact that it only has 6ish mega pixels is no hindrance unless you plan to crop the hell out of your photos (but then you just by a telephoto lens) The combination of camera and lens is ideal for many situations and  provides a sturdy starting point for a collection. Despite my D200 I wouldnt be without my light easy to bring along D40, especially as all my lenses are interchangeable between the two (although you will have to go without auto focus on lenses without built in motors).|#|Main gripe is the lack of internal motor so if you think youll get serious with photography and your planning on building your lens collection be aware that this camera can only auto focus with lenses that have built in motors  there are plenty of these lenses on the market but a few photographers favourites dont. There are only three focus points too, but this is seldom the end of the world (just focus on your subject, press the shutter button halfway down to lock and re-frame).
10.0|#|Fantastic camera, wifes christmas gift, she finds it so easy to use, brilliant photo's,red eye a thing of the past.best camera I have ever bought.|#|I had to buy a case, thought a quality camera should come with a quality case.

10.0|#||#|I worry about trapping dust in the body when changing lens. Surely Nikon could develop a solution to this; perhaps a cover iris that would envelop the sensor when exposed, or a vibration facility that would shake free any particles from the sensor. It almost makes me resist the urge to change a lens.
9.0|#|Small size ,virtually no shutter lag , simple auto mode or near professional manual operation .High ISO sensitivity . Many features .|#|Limited Nikkor lens support for all functions  .Only 3 auto focus areas .
9.0|#|It's hard to find any faults with this camera for the price. At the time of purchase it was excellent value, but...|#|...it's value has been slightly deminished, with the D40X being released so soon after the introduction of the D40. I'm not sure I need the extra megapixels, but it's slightly annoying none the less.
8.0|#|Bought as a present for my 18 year old daughter who had been using my D50.  The D40 is slightly smaller and fits snugly in the smaller hand.  All the usual refinements from the Nikon 'D' range but with a larger LCD display.  Well built and simple to use.  Clearly aimed as an entry level DSLR; the advanced settings will also appeal to the more experienced photographer who needs a spare body but is limited in carrying space.|#|If you've used another Nikon 'D' before this camera will feel significantly smaller, but the large LCD makes up for it.  The menu is also slightly different and less intuitive, so convertees will spend extra time looking for their favourite settings.  Nevertheless as a 'first' DSLR I couldn't fault it.
9.0|#|S cameras without the use of a tripod. The battery performance is very good.|#|The camera is not fully compatible with all Nikon auto-focus lenses. It can only auto-focus with AF-S type lenses (the focus motor is built into the lens). The only lenses that Nikon currently sells with AF-S are zoom lenses. None of the fixed focal length lenses made by Nikon are AF-S. You have to manually focus if you decide to use those lenses. Most users will use a zoom lens so this is not really an issue. The camera does not have auto exposure bracketing. You have to manually change the exposure when bracketing. The camera also does not have depth of field preview.
9.0|#|Very good level entry dslr|#|
9.0|#|Value for money.|#|No lens motor in body means non-AF-S/AF-I lenses are manual focus only.
7.0|#|Very fast focusing, very easy to use, although it would be good if there were extra buttons for some functions, light!|#|Doesn't have auto focus on the camera itself, which means that all the lenses you buy must have it. This limits the number of lenses that can be used with the camera, leaving only the more expensive ones to choose from. Also images are soft with the 18-200mm lens that I am currently using
9.0|#|Good manual, ease of use, bright viewfinder and LCD screen, price, excellent battery life.|#|I like the option to view photos in the viewfinder which my old Fuji provided, but which is noot possible on the NIkon.
9.0|#|A quality product which is easy to use.|#|The instruction book can be difficult to understand.
9.0|#|Lightweight and small but feels very comfortable to hold and use. Solid feel and ergonomically strong. Personally don't feel the need for a top plate display and this was a consideration in purchase. I could have afforded a D80 but preferred the layout of the D40. Excellent product, great for first time DSLR buyers, it does almost everything you would need.|#|Personally find in camera editing features overrated, prefer to leave this to proper photo editing software. But that applies to many other models as well.
9.0|#|A Digital SLR for barely more money than a compact! Forget the number of pixels, the  photo quality is much better than my 10 megapixel compact, not even comparable. The photos are professional quality, and there is no annoying shutter delay, perfect for action shots.|#|For the money- NONE at all!
9.0|#|Best value DSLR on the market. Very fast start up, you can use it in just the same manner as a traditional film SLR. It also has excellent point and shoot capabilities if you need it. Works well with all the film speeds up to 1600ASA. I'm particularly pleased with pictures taken under street lighting. Still exploring all it's capabilities. Excellent LCD back panel playback  which in highlight mode shows if the sky etc is over exposed so yo can retake the shot. An added avantage particularly for me is that I can use many of the lenses from earlier Nikon cameras. Other good points are the battery life.|#|Tends to over expose cloudy skies loosing cloud detail, you can set exposure compensation to get around this. A cable release would have been really nice.
10.0|#|SHOOT (FINEPIX 602Z - PREVIOUS CAMERA)|#|NONE
9.0|#|Bargain price SLR: Simple to use with enough control and features for novice users to play around with. It feels very of good build quality whilst being light and relatively compact.|#|Some of the control combinations needed to achieve the desired effects are a little cumbersome, especially without the top LCD to show the settings. You will probably want to upgrade the lens fairly quickly.
8.0|#||#|Autofocus often struggles to get a fix in bright sky shots or high-contrast areas tracking a moving subject - better to use manual focus.
9.0|#|Can get into more complicated features if required.|#|Lenses expensive with AF-S feature.
9.0|#|The battery seems to last forever (I have yet to recharge mine) so I hope plenty of warning is given before a charge is required.|#|The supplied manual may contain all the information but it is not the easiest to read to learn about all the camera features and their use. There are some good books available for this purpose and I can recommend the field guide by David D Busch.

9.0|#|great camera for somebody looking for taking better quality photos than you can get with a compact camera without needing to become an expert in setting up shots.  Very much a point and click experience with the option for delving deeper into settings if you so desire.  Exactly what we were looking for.|#|For me the camera has no real bad points, it would be cool if it took all the standard Nikon lenses but apart from that no real issues.   For a serious photographer I would imagine more control over settings would be desired.
9.0|#|In auto mode very easy to use, just point and shoot|#|as usual with anything electronic the menus can be a bit of a minefield until you get used to them, don't expect to start taking composed photos straight away! and don't forget to take the manual with you! You'll never remember it all!
8.0|#|Light and comfortable in the hands, easy to use in automatic mode and tons of features to master with time. Ok software and user manual.|#|A bit more plastcky than I would have expected, for the price, and a better coloured printed guide would have been useful.

Very good image quality for an amazing price, which is complimented by the cameras tiny body making it portable. However the small balance isnt compromised by the lens which you find on some slrs.|#|Low pixel image sensor and no self cleaning system that could have been useful
9.0|#|Very easy to use and gives you plenty of future scope as you learn digital photography. Good lightweight construction.|#|The lens being 55mm which is normal eyesight could have done with being say up to 70mm just to give that extra variety without the expense of having to buy another lens.

The case is massive (obviously designed for a camcorder, not a camera) making it impractical and I ended up having to buy another one anyway, so made it not such a good deal, hence low score for value for money.
8.0|#|Compact.  Good looking product and easy to use in auto mode.|#|some of the more complex options need time to adjust to for a first time SLR user
8.0|#|Very light weight camera, easy to use yet it has various manual settings. Functionality for the price is fantastic.|#|None that I have found as yet.
9.0|#|It's great for beginners. It's complicated enough to define itself from a digital compact camera but not too complicated. It has all the useful settings and filters.|#|The lens isn't good for every kind of photography.
9.0|#|Great for a beginner in SLR Digital. Very good value. Easy to use. Images are excellent for a 6mp camera.|#|Should be able to have Raw+JPEG on fine sertting as well as basic. Also should fit VR lens as standard kit, even if this pushes up price a little. Only other areas I would have liked are available on more expensive models and presumably omitted to keep price down. Live view, depth of field preview, auto dust removal.
10.0|#|For my first SLR this is very good quality pictures and easy to use. The build quality is very good also. The D40(X) is also light compared with my expectations and you can get sometimes professional results with a bit of time spent on setting the scene and maybe the settings.|#|Maybe opt for D40X or D60 if you reckon you will need more than 6MP in the future.
10.0|#|Light weight, great build quality, easy for beginners to SLR cameras to use|#|
8.0|#|The D40(x) is a great camera to step up to from a compact Digital - it gives the user the freedom to manipulate settings that most compact digitals automatically set. The size of the D40 isn't too bad either - it's a nice camera to hold, and the feature buttons are all in logical and easy to reach places. Resolution is good and crisp|#|Some of the more advanced settings are hidden deep in sub-menus, but then for the amateurs (like me!) that's probably a good thing..
9.0|#|Easy to use; strong image quality; feels robustly built; quick start-up time; no shutter lag means that capturing moving images is much more successful that with a compact.|#|Slightly bulky to carry; accompanying software is not the most intuative to use.
8.0|#|On automatic photo quality is good,and the camera is easy to use|#|The camera is quite heavy and the lens supplied with the camera while good of its type could do with being 18-200 which would make it unbeatable
9.0|#|light in weight, great image quality, easy to use|#|none as yet
9.0|#|Easy in use, high quality of pictures. Perfect choice for beginners- to learn the basics about photography before investing in really sophisticated camera.|#|
8.0|#|Fantastic picture quality, and ease of use.|#|There is a large range of features but little direction in what situation to use them. Anti red eye feature doesnt work all the time. And the viewing time on the screen when looking at shots is not long enough.
10.0|#|Light, easy to fit, easy to focus.|#|none realyy for my purpose
9.0|#|I must say very good value SLR. My first digital SLR and the picture quality is amazing and great features. The publishing software that came with the camera is very easy to use and manage photos taken.|#|Wish extra lenses were free!
8.0|#||#|Dislike the idea that only DX lenses can be used for the auto focus facility.
9.0|#|Sturdy well made body with good quality standard lens. Very easy to use menu system with large lcd screen. Instant start up also the programme modes work well.|#|No exposure bracketing or depth of field button. I suppose Nikon have to differentiate the D40x from the D80 somehow.
9.0|#|Auto mode is very good and easy to use.|#|Doesn't focus at very close range, ie 20cm.
9.0|#|Good entry level SLR digital camera with loads of features.|#|Software only has a 30 day time limit after which you must either buy it or get another photo suite which can edit RAW images.

8.0|#|A good albeit basic starter DSLR. The ease of use and the ability to take many shots to familiarise myself without the cost and need to develop film is of great benefit. A necessary purchase as I would not consider buying a more expensive DSLR only to find out that it was not for me!|#|Like it and I guess I'll have to consider an upgrade at some point!
9.0|#|shoot cameras.  Great build quality, clear menu system, very impressive battery life, clear LCD display.|#|Built-in flash inadequate - I would highly recommend buying a SB400 or SB600 flash unit ahead of a second lens - makes a huge improvement to the quality of indoor pics.  No bracketing option - not really an issue unless you want to try HDR photography.
9.0|#|As a complete novice, I found the features and ease of use brilliant. No need to spend the extra money on additional pixels.|#|Not so much a bad point, but I think that within the bundles that are offered a wide angle lens would be a good option, as you quickly realise that you need one. Maybe thats the reason why its not offered i.e.extra sales
10.0|#|Easy to use even for a complete beginner like myself. Takes a cracking picture.|#|Very occasionally refuses to take a picture but second attempt is fine.

9.0|#|The D40 has a comfortable feel, and balance. It has ease of use for the beginner, and plenty of settings for the more experienced photographer. Above all it takes really good shots, clear, sharp, excellent colour.|#|If I was really picky then in some situations it would have been a handy feature to be able to use the playback monitor to compose the shot, rather than the view finder. Haven't found any other bad points.

Battery life good, fast uploading to computer via USB2.0, easy to follow menu structure that can be customised, thus preventing children chanign the settings accidentally.|#|Software does not support NEF (RAW) files even though the camera does (although I knew this before buying), but you can download a free plug-in for Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 or later which does provide support.
8.0|#|Looks and feels great.  Really easy to start using straight away.|#|Not compatiable with many lens.

9.0|#|Very good value for money. Picture quality and ease of use.|#|Old Non-G Nikon lenses (i.e. with aperture ring) do not mount well on the D40. It requires a certain degree of force to get such a lens attached. This is contrary to Nikon's claim of mechanical fit of such a lens on the D40.
10.0|#|Clear menus. Dial selection very good. Easy to learn features. 'Standard' lens offers good range for landscape and portrait photography. Excellent sensitivity (ISO range).|#|No facility to keep sensor dust-free

I have a D200 but often pick up the D40 because its so easy and quick to use.|#|None regarding the camera although a bit more software, like remote capture bundled with Canon cameras, would be nice.

9.0|#|Excellent build quality, feels like a much more expensive camera. Size is just right not too small but not too large either. Lots of features that you can either use manually or with leave it on auto and get some great pictures. Great inbuilt help system.|#|The only real thing I can come up with is it is only 6 megapixel but if you are not planning on printing out much bigger than A3 then don't worry about it.

9.0|#|ease of use|#|comes without a camera to tv lead
8.0|#|Excellent value for money and extremely easy to get great shots from just reading the quick start guide. On the rare occassions you need to deal with red eye, it can be corrected using the camera so easily. Lightweight and comfortable to use. Multi exposures are quicker and less restricted than some more expensive models.|#|You are restricted on lenses because of the auto focus mechanism, but this wasn't an issue for me as I bought the extra lens I needed with the camera and got a good deal on the price.
10.0|#|Compact, easy to use, built-in flash powrful enough to cover most indoor events, compatible with previous Nikon lenses, although the autofocus is a different system making the older lenses manual operation.|#|None apparent as yet, watching battery life, no prob as yet.

8.0|#|Very easy to get it up and running. The zoom is pretty fast, and the camera  overall is pretty light.|#|There was some dust on the low pass filter. I only found out when looking at my holiday pictures. The 2 black spots appeared on all the pictures from picture #1, which make me think the dust was on the filter from day 1. It is fixed now.

Can't wait to try playing with the settings now.  Also the camera is quite light and unobtrustive to carry during a day out.|#|
8.0|#|Excellent value for money good stepping stone into SLR photography|#|Just one little niggle - the plastic lens hood is easy to lose or mislay as has no thread to connect with camera body. It is so easy to lose especially if your in a hurry to take a swift picture.

10.0|#|Image quality. Don't be fooled by the mega-pixel con. If you pint 6x4 (like most of us) there will be no noticable difference between 6mp and 12mp. 6x4 or5x7 prints from this are excellent, easily as good as my 35mm SLR.|#|White balance. Like most digital camera's it has a tendancy to over expose. This is easily corrected but can be a pain if it's a one-off shot and you don't get a chance to compensate and take the picture again.

10.0|#|The Nikon D40 very much exceeds expectations. Picture quality is superb and you can very easily produce your own proffessional quality pictures. The feel of shutter release button has got to be experienced to appreciate the lovely sensation you get from releasing it. It feels right in your hand and has a good quality feel overall. I definitely will recommend the D40 to anyone pondering on getting one.|#|The D40 came with an 18mm - 55mm lens. I bought in addition the 55mm - 200mm lens, though my absolute preference would have been the 18mm - 200mm. The snag was that, this lens alone was more expensive than the D40 with kit. Other than that i am a happy bunny.

These cameras are in a different world from bridge and compact cameras.|#|Very few if any.  I think I'd prefer more than 6 mega pixels, but at this price, who can complain?  The only major annoyance from Nikon is that they didn't see fit to include RAW software with it - that's an extra cost.

10.0|#|Very user friendly camers|#|They just brought out the D60 which superceds the D40X
7.0|#|Easy to use - took very little time to start to take pictures at a basic standard|#|It assumes you know what you're doing on the rudiments of photography for things more sophisticated - but perhaps that's just my problem!
9.0|#|Excellent build quality. The camera is not as big as some of its competitors, yet still feels very comfortable in the hand. The quality of the photos taken from the camera are well above average - though tend to be a little soft. I've sharpened these using the camera's menu options. All in all, I've no regrets buying the camera and would recommend it without hesitation.That said, you really need to tweak the options to get the best out of it.|#|The default setting for the image quality is for me a little soft. But, this can be altered. The menu system is also ponderous though quite comprehensive. Other than these I can't think of any problems (yet!!).

IF YOU ARE THINKING OF HAVING AN SLR INSTEAD OF A COMPACT I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND IT.|#|THE LENSE CAP DOESNT STAY ATTATCHED AND ITS A BIT BULKY BUT VERY LIGHT CONSIDERING ITS SIZE. A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR A LOVELY CAMERA AT SUCH A LOW PRICE.

Ended up buying a 3rd party guide book.  Doesn't appear to be any way of locking shutter open for long exposures unless you have the optional remote control.
10.0|#|It is a good size, takes good quality pictures, the features on the camera are excellent.  My best purchase ever!|#|If carrying it around for hours, it does get heavy but a good quality camera bag can help there.
10.0|#|It is an excellant camera, the pictures are great and it is really light in comparison with similar cameras like the Cannon|#|Would have liked a free case with it
10.0|#|Great Beginner Camera for people new to DSLR, the camera has a lot of point and shoot friendly features aswell as the advanced settings for those seeking more control over the outcome of their pictures too. Dont be put off by the outdated information about lack of lens availability you can get them with ease now 18-55 kit lens and 55-200 nikon lens is all you are ever likely to need for carrying round anyway.

10.0|#|What a brilliant all-rounder!!! I'ts a very handy size but with the punch of bigger and more expensive cameras. It has all the functions you need and the image quality is excellent - even for 6megapixels. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this. A great camera for more than just the enthusiast!|#|
10.0|#|Easy to use and light. Any modern Nikon lens fits. A delight for my wife to use.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|Love this Camera.|#|Can't think of any.
9.0|#|My first experience with a digital SLR. From picking it up and using point and shoot to exploring the more advanced fetaures it was straightforward to use.|#|
9.0|#|Easy of use; quick startup; compact; excellent value for money package|#|none
10.0|#|Takes really great photos.|#|Only takes NIKON brand batteries which are really expensive - cheapest I found was £39.00. If you try 'compatible' batteries, the camera won't work. You'll need more than the one battery the camera comes with, so take current battery prices into consideration when deciding whether to purchase the D5100.
9.0|#|Light and compact|#|None. I changed from the Nikon'smore  heavily built series and I prefer this lighter version (much easier to handle than the D7000, which is 50% dearer). You would have to be very rough with this fine camera, or a professional to need the D7000. I gave the 18-55mm lens to a friend and kept my 18-200mm.  Both are absolutely superb.
10.0|#|Awesome camera. The variangle lens is very handy for taking shots from unique angles. Its very easy to get great pics with this camera!|#|For someone new to digital SLR cameras it can be quite daunting dealing with a relatively high spec camera but familiarisation is quite straight forward. When using the video recorder, the internal sound of the AF working can often override the audio of the video but if you buy the attachable mic, this can be eliminated.
10.0|#|Overall a much simpler camera to use with brilliant results and it seems to do the same as my old D90.|#|Only the lack of a lens hood but have been told by Nikon that the HB-45 will fit.
8.0|#|A very comprehensive package, more features without the bulk of some more expensive competitors|#|Live View is a rather iffy. Autofocus doesn't work with my much used Sigma 50-500 in live view mode (although the lens works fine in normal use).  That is disappointing, but it is the only bad point I have found so far.
10.0|#|Image quality, features, frames per second and buffer size at fine jpeg, battery life, auto focus, video mode, help button is great for learning to use the camera. Even as point and shoot in auto mode this camera does a great job, the pre-set scenes also produce great results.|#|I haven't found any yet, at this price I can't fault it. Just make sure you order a good SD card as it comes without one.
10.0|#|full HD, Swivel display|#|no autofocus body motor - old AF lenses are manual only
10.0|#|Image quality is amazing.  Using a Nikkor 70mm to 300mm VR anywhere lens on full zoom there is no chromatic aberration in the picture.  Feature packed camera as good as the D7000.  Highly recommended.|#|None
10.0|#|Quick shooting easy use execllent features quick and easy flash for any shoot 10/10 would recommend !!!!|#|None cause it's Nikon of course !
8.0|#|Button layout is good, everything fell to hand naturally, I found the manual focus was excellent especially if you press the magnifying plus button makes the manual focus excellent as I dont like auto focus. The varifocal LCD screen. I havent had chance to go out daytimes, but have been out night shooting with excellent results.|#|Taking it out the box it felt cheap and plastic but I think it is because of getting used to using a particular camera but after playing with it for couple hours the plastic feeling vanished when I got used it.
9.0|#|Image quality is insane and is a better option compared to the canon 600D if you dont intend to use video recording as much|#|
9.0|#|Fantastic camera, very pleased with my purchase.|#|video is good quality but you can hear the motor focusing quite heavily - not for heavy video use.
8.0|#|Great keen amateur camera. Packed with features and will produce great images in full auto until you gain the confidence to move to manual. Will scale with you as your skill level increases. Tilt screen is very handy. Built-in flash is very good. Movie mode is fantastic with full HD.|#|Kit lens isn't brilliant unfortunately, but good enough to get you started. Rear screen prone to smudges. Quite expensive. Nit picking because there's little to fault.
8.0|#|Excellent photos from easy Automatic and variety of Scene settings.  Everything can be customised for full manual control|#|Some of the manual controls are buried in menus.
10.0|#|feel about it - just like the movies! I also purchased a book for the D5100 by David Busch - very intuitive and helped me get to grips with the camera - and all of its hidden treasures - with great ease. Highly recommended!|#|point but, in movie mode - and without an external mic with the camera set to auto focus - you can hear the motor in the lens. This is easy to overcome with the camera's mic input jack and I fitted my Rode SVM to it with ease using the hot shoe mount on the camera. Hey presto - no noise and excellent video quality!
10.0|#|Fantastic image quality. I have owned several entry level DSLRs and I have never been happy with them for various reasons. This is the first DSLR that ticks all the boxes: most important being image quality. I have taken some portrait shots of my daughter that are studio quality. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a quality entry-level DSLR.|#|None as yet

8.0|#|excellent user friendly feature packed beginner dslr with performance close to its professional siblings|#|product warranty is not local
9.0|#|Build quality, features and image quality are everything you would expect from Nikon - a great camera. The articulated back screen is a particularly good feature when videoing. I have quite large hands but I find handling the camera is comfortable and not too heavy.|#|Would be nice if the auto focus motor was in the camera body, rather than the lens as this would mean I could use the old lenses from my 35mm slr. However, the kit lens supplied does have vibration reduction and is proving to be a fine partner for the camera.
10.0|#|the flip screen is great and the Effects mode dial is great too, especially the colour select mode I love it!|#|
8.0|#|Nice pictures, easy to use, good price.|#|The LCD screen needs to be well protected.
10.0|#|Almost everything. (see bad points, if they can really be called that at this price point!).  This is an upgrade for my D60 and that never disappointed either. It was that good I upgraded to stretch my photography skills further. I would not hesiotate to recommend Nikon to anyone. Easy to use, fantastic picture quiality.|#|I really wish Nikon would add Depth of Field preview to all their range. This is the only thing really lacking.  It's a nice'to have' but not critical.  Not sure if other makes have this at entry/mid range either.
9.0|#|Outstanding picture quality over a full range of conditions|#|Live view slow to respond; works much quicker using eyepiece
8.0|#|Menus are easy to understand although could be laid out a little better. Overall I would say I was glad I made the purchase over the Nikon D3100.|#|Kit lens sometimes finds it hard to focus on a particular subject - although you can always fall back on manual focus.

7.0|#|Very easy to use, you could get by without an instruction book. Very quiet shutter indeed. Feels well balanced in the hand(s) easy to keep the camera still when pressing the shutter.  LCD display is good and clear, very informative.  Switching from stills to video filming is easy, no fuss. Everything comes easy to hand, very well thought out. The mode dial turns perpetually    -excellent.   An easy to work camera that would please virtually any photographer.|#|Despite all the good points the camera I purchased has been sent back to Nikon by myself due to very poor resolution.  My Olympus E620 leaves it standing.  This is a big disappointment considering the reviews stating an excellent image quality equalling the Nikon d7000.  The definition is hopeless and dosen't look any better than a compact with a measly sensor.

7.0|#|Easy to use|#|Bit heavy
9.0|#|Very easy to use and set up. As this is my first (D)SLR I am a beginner so most of the features have yet to be tested but even on auto the quality of the pictures surpasses all my previous hopes. I've used it on the beach and theme parks with filters for family shots and the shots are just great. Definitely didn't need the D7000 and love the screen on this over the D3100.|#|None yet but not really tested its capabilities.
10.0|#|great product ! great price !|#|
9.0|#|Excellent Camera for everyone. Very easy to use. Would strongly recommend it.|#|None
8.0|#|I like the adjustable lcd screen so I can shoot at varying angles that I wouldn't achieve by using the view finder. Also takes a decent hdr shot within the camera and great quality pictures. Very light and small, even the wife prefers this camera compared to my D90.|#|Battery drains very quickly, which I have read about so will invest in purchasing another battery.
9.0|#|easy to use, even for a novice with no experience of photography, using auto mode so can get great pictures immediately whilst learning the functions etc|#|

10.0|#|Fantastic results|#|Not a very thorough manual provided,  still awaiting Nikon cash back.
9.0|#|I have not used it very much as yet for I purchased this camera for a long 3 months abroad. I like the weight, the way it fits into your hand, the many different effects you are able to get when using this camera.|#|I have taken a few pics and so far the quality is average. It could very well be me and the fact that I need more experience with the camera to shape up better pics.
10.0|#|usual nikon quality and ease of use. good quality amateur but has some  functions for the more adventurous photographer. Can use my older nikon lenses albeit without AF but save an expensive lens purchase|#|none so far
9.0|#|My first DSLR makes it so easy to take great photos. I bought it because I have a young baby and wanted to record her growing up and I am not disappointed with the results. Now I just need to go on a course to learn how to use it properly.|#|None so far.
7.0|#|excellent flash, low light quality, bright view finder, compact|#|poor menus, ease of setting change, no manual overide of ''scene'' settings. battery life, slightly over exposed pictures
9.0|#|Very good results when comparing what it all costs and the technology and performance you get. Though good photographic equipment doesn't come cheap, when you realise that you go back and recall the record of the event whenever you want to, then you realise it's money well spent. Otherwise you might never see it again. What price is a memory?|#|It wasn't free!
9.0|#|Once you have learned (as a bit of a novice in my case) then the array of features on the camera are very good.|#|I feel that the learning process can be a bit long and complicated.  Having said that once you pick up the process then everything works fine.
10.0|#|As a first time buyer of an SLR camera, this camera is deffinately worth getting. The functions are easy to use and the quality of the images are great.|#|
10.0|#|Very good photo's in auto mode as well as many options once you take the plunge to use one of the other modes, the live view mode is great for shots where using the view finder is not an option, hd video is very good and very usable.|#|Battery soon de-pleats on live view mode.

9.0|#|-is lighter than its predecessor d5000|#|so far there is no
5.0|#|Can Ocasionally  take good pictures. Has many settings and features.|#|Can take  some terrible pictures. focuses on the thing you least want. Struggles to focus on far distant objects. Focus not that sharp. Takes ages to focus. Purple fringing. Prefer my old canon powershot is s3. It was more reliable. You just dont know how this thing will react to situations. I been into photography for a fair while and use my powershot on all settings. This is unpredictable. Some shots good. Some shots bad. You cant relly on that when its important situations. Wish i just bought the latest version of old camera.
10.0|#|Having used a Nikon D50, the D5100 is a dream to use ,whether in Auto mode or Manual ,and the images are excellent. Wished i had bought a lot sooner.|#|
10.0|#|This camera is definiately worth buying|#|None yet.
10.0|#|I chose this camera because it was good at stills and movie. I am found of both, but it is awkward carrying two cameras. The sound can be improved by using a Nikon ME-1 microphone. The Nikon SB700 flash integrates extremely well with this camera. The Nikon D5100 is very flexible, but easy to use.|#|It would be nice to have a wider choice of movie formats, but I guess you can only fit so much into a light camera.
9.0|#|Impressed with the features and image quality,mostly impressed with the value for money|#|Cant find any at the moment,apart from coming with a manual in another language.
8.0|#|Very good build quality, and excellent image quality.|#|Not that intuitive to use, even from someone quite camera savvy. So you will need to refer to the manual quite often if you want to use the more advanced features. Not much of a con once you have learnt the manual.
9.0|#|So far have found the camera very easy to use - I am lucky to be computer and camera literate - but even so it is straightforward enough and am very impressed with the picture quality|#|None so far!

6.0|#|Body is smaller than expected but for an amateur DSLR, this outperforms all it's rival.|#|Does not work with my sigma 10-20mm lens which in LV mode, auto focus not working. This is probably due to the sigma lens model but it's a shame.

7.0|#|as a beginner i could not say any. just startin to xplore world of dslr...|#|none at this point.
10.0|#|There is really nothing bad about this camera. I only wish now that I had gone for the double lens kit.There is quite a lot of stuff to get your head around when learning to use this camera but that is really part of the fun.  I have gotten some really beautiful images with this camera and hope to be able to splurge for a few more lenses.  I especially like the fact that I can use a 32g memory card so can fill it up while on holiday.  The battery lasts surprisingly long too as other friend who are Nikon owners say their batteries need to be charged frequently.|#|Honestly, I cant think of a bad point.....
9.0|#|Lens package was good but the camera bag was rubbish - too small and inflexible. The camera, as you would expect from a Nikon, is first class. Easy to use but lots of features that take a bit of getting use to, especially if you've never had an SLR before. I once had a Minolta, but back in the eighties, so things have changed a great deal since then. The screen is clear and, once you get use to it, is fairly easy to understand. With more regular use I'm certain it will be a breeze. There were two lenses supplied as part of the package; one is a Nikon 18-55 zoom and the other, a 70-300 zoom lens from Sigma. Both operate as expected with as expected results. The Macro on the Sigma Zoom lens is brilliant and I have already managed some pretty good shots of bees and butterflies.|#|None, really. Just the useless camera bag that came with the package. And the battery charger is poorly designed. It's limited to a UK type three-pin plug and it would have been a big benefit to have a USB-type charger, so Nikon are a bit behind the times with that.
9.0|#|Can use as simple point and shoot or full manual. Ease of access to various, including manual, functions. Good colour and clarity of images.Fairly compact.|#|I haven't found any yet. However, my previous bridge camera with a fixed zoom lens was very convenient when travelling around. There is no doubt that having to buy, carry and use a number of lenses  means that I am less inclined to have the camera with me at all times just in case an unexpected opportunity for a good photograph occurs.
9.0|#|Great photos|#|None
10.0|#|The Image Quality is very Nice|#|
10.0|#|ok|#|not
9.0|#|Fantastic camera with more features than is normally given on a camera in this price range. I am a keen photographer and wanted to move up from my Fuji bridge camera to a full DSLR and I have not been disappointed. The image quilty is amazing and the options to experiment while in manual mode is vast. For the money in my view you cannot buy a better camera.|#|Some options need to be set each time in the menu when taking shots, ie HDR pictures. Not really a problem just a little time comsuming.
10.0|#|This my third Nikon camera, from D80/D3200 and now the D5100( I use the Nikkor 18-200mm lens it is ideal for the amateur). The Nikon Camera is just a cut above the rest, I just wish Nikon would make a camcorder.|#|

9.0|#|The auto focus system is excellent and very quick. The exposure control was fairly accurate even in some awkward situations . The picture quality was of a high professional standard as expected . Special and extra features are plenty on this Nikon model and the built in help guide is very useful if you don't understand something . Overall it's an excellent armature entry level camera.|#|Very plasticky feel to the whole camera, it makes it lightweight but doesn't have the solid feel compared with the magnesium body. The battery holder door is very flimsy and could break very easily especially  when fitting an after market battery grip where the door has to be completely removed. The Nikon EN-EL 14 battery also is extremely expensive compared to the same battery say for the Nikon P 7000 the same battery but without a chip.

10.0|#|Very easy to use - good in that it has no real delay between focus and actual taking of shot. Flash is very bright so pictures are clear and easy to see. Very small and light, I bought this for my daughter who is at university and wanted something very small to take out to clubs and parties. The colour is great too (I bought blue). Probably one of the best things about it is the battery charger which you just plug into the camera. Battery lasts ages as well once charged.|#|My only worry is that the cover of the opening where you plug the battery charger in seems quite fragile and I am sure that it will snap off.

9.0|#|size - metal case - ease of use - great battery life|#|none
10.0|#|I love the design of the camera - its small and lightweight, and really easy to use, plus the metal casing makes is robust.  The features are really good too - there are loads of different shooting settings.  I really like the optional anti-blur setting - very handy.  Its completely idiot proof (the delete button is a dustbin!) and the zoom range is pretty good too (obviously image quality goes a little when you use the digital zoom, but it's still very good).  The package with the memory card and case was excellent value - the 1GB memory card will hold at least 500 photos, and the case is very smart.  Overall I'm really happy with my camera and frequently recommend it to my friends... I'm taking it to South Africa next week, so I guess that'll be the real test...|#|The night-time setting is a little hard to use - you have to keep your hands really steady so it doesn't blur
8.0|#|Compact, easy to use and well built.|#|No optical viewfinder (I knew that when I bought it) and flash colour pics not too great.

8.0|#|Loads of features, brilliant sensor good flash and has that SLR feel about in the way the menu's are set up.|#|All of the good work is let down by a poor lense and poor zoom. Consider the panasonic lumix it may be only 7mp but the lense and zoom are top notch giving a better quality picture.
9.0|#|Quality of images. Image stabilisation. A good second camera to my D70s|#|Small controls. Although it doesnt help having big hands.Some cameras have better focal range but i would nt  i would nt be put off by this..

9.0|#|Versatile but still easy to use.  Many additional features that make this a valuable camera in a wide variety of settings.|#|I am slightly worried that I might catch and damage the small lever at the front of the camera but accept that there are so many features that the lever provides extra access.
9.0|#|as a pocketable substitute for my nikon D-slr its fantastic. The manual modes offer so much more control than most compacts. Really happy with it!|#|The metal front spoiled by the plastic back, would have been good to have the option to shoot raw files but if i really want that can revert to my nikon D-slr.
10.0|#|A very quick starting camera, menus are very easy to use the build qulity is excellent, the image quality really was excellent, a very good camera would recommend to anyone, I am getting one for my partner as they so good.|#|No bad points just an excellent camera.
8.0|#|Compact.  VR function is useful.|#|Having a viewfinder would be nice, for those who are a little bit more serious about taking good pictures.  Keeping the camera away from the body due to having to use the monitor increases camera shake and the VR function doesn't always compensate for it.
9.0|#|Very small, easy to carry around.  Can point and shoot a picture.|#|Difficult to see the screen in bright light, even with a screen cover.  A view finder would make this the perfect product.

10.0|#|Large LCD, ease of use, compact and light weight, ideal for non-techie person of a certain age.|#|Delete button too close to other function buttons so could be pressed in error however, it does give you the option not to proceed.  Difficult to find a suitable leather case for this camera.
8.0|#|Ease of use, styling, large screen.|#|Takes too long to charge after flash has gone off, also flash is too bright and there is no way to lower the intesity. Not enough manual control if you need it.
8.0|#|In its price band, its well featured and easy to use, small enough to be carried easy with a good ASA range and image stabilisation|#|Heavy on batteries I guess because there is no viewfinder, so you need to buy a set of rechargeables.bles
9.0|#|Ease of use|#|Uses a lot of battery power
9.0|#|it has a large viewing screen and its really easy to use, even changing the iso for night time pictures etc is really simple. nothing is complicated i didnt even read the instructions! i bought this as a smaller camera for more everyday use and it does everything i need. i recently did a slideshow of pictures straight from the camera on our TV and it took about 1 minute to set up! very impressive considering how bad with technology i am!|#|if im being really critical, it could be a bit slimmer. but for the price you cant complain really.

8.0|#|High pixel count, large view screen, high optical zoom for price at time of purchase.  Nice feel to camera.|#|Upgrade of software took forever, crashed PC and Kodak were unhelpful.  Some images (mainly indoor) are a bit dark and need enhancing.  Camera is a little big compared with some but easy to handle.
9.0|#|Light and easy to use. Well made and produces excellent pictures|#|The image produced is not exactly the same as seen through the viewfinder or the screen (slightly smaller).Software not as good in some areas as my previous camera.
10.0|#|This get little camera takes superb photos and has plently of features to keep you entertained.|#|Seems to struggle when using the flash as you get too much white wash.  This can be adjusted manually but it never seems to look 'just' right.
9.0|#|simple to use and durable case|#|small sreen
9.0|#|settings - uses SD memory card - small size.|#|Not very fast in terms of press,focus and shoot. Larger screen would be better (as in coolpix 5900). Use of ordinary AA bateries would be cheaper.
10.0|#|Very light and easy to use,love this type of battery.|#|Battery charger is heavy to take on holiday
10.0|#|Compact and easy to use with excellent picture quality and a very reasonable price.|#|It would be better if it could be fitted into a cradle to make it easier and quicker to download pictures and recharge the battery but this is only a small inconvenience.

9.0|#|Easy to use with a good selection of auto situation programmes such as for taking pictures of fireworks or snow scenes. Fabulous quality pictures.|#|There's so much the camera can do but need time to probably read the instruction manual to make the optimum use.

9.0|#|good quality pictures|#|big cut off of image size through viewfinder to that obtained on back screen

10.0|#|A great camera with everything you need and more!  Incredibly easy to use and produces high quality pictures!|#|Pity that you can't transfer images back to the camera after having edited them on your computer.

9.0|#|Very user friendly|#|None at present
9.0|#|Very easy to use fully automatic - just point and shot. Delivers excellent shots for daylight and indoor use. Excellent macro capabilities. Very compact and stylish design.|#|A few manual settings. Average performance in night shots - blurry images. For best night shots you need a tripod to keep the camera steady. Finally the video sound quality is average since the mic is very sensitive and close to the lens and picks the noise from the autofocus motor. Even if you disable the autofocus it will pick the enviromental noise.

9.0|#|easy to use.simple menu|#|
7.0|#|Easy to use, good value, good image quality in good light conditions.|#|It has no AF illuminator so struggles, sometimes in vain, to focus in low light conditions.
8.0|#|Great little point-and-shoot, no problems yet. Good size and fits easily into your pocket. Picture quality is appropriate for the price.|#|Doesn't seem to have a feature for changing the shutter time maually. Battery life for ordinary non-recharchable batteries is very poor, certainly worth considering buying the Nikon Coolpix batteries and charger.

10.0|#|It gives me the fancy stuff I debated over from DSLR point of view, without the extra weight and baggage needed with the DSLR.  Some of technical reviews talk the P80 down a little, those guys must be real fussy, as I am delighted.  I'm glad I went for the P80 over the DSLR as at this point in my picture taking life it gives me all the extra features I wanted, plus, I'm well chuffed with the x18 Optical Zoom on it.  It let's me get close to things without the need for lens changes and to my eye, the quality is excellent.  It's lightweight yet feels well built at the same time. No hesitaton recommending this to anyone looking for a stop off point between Compact and Full SLR.|#|At full zoom a bit of shake but this is user not camera and you learn to get things settled before final snap.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality, very good build quality, and that mega 18x zoom. i used it on my holiday, and it took stunning shots. Also the time lapse feature is very good. i could say more, but it might not fit in the box! For this price its AWSOME|#|slow start up speed. screen is prone to picking up fingerprints.

9.0|#|It works well mounted on the eyepiece of my astro telescope|#|After a long search for a replacement to my Dimage X60 I find I can't fault the Nikon
10.0|#|I'm delighted with the camera because it suits my purposes. Its easy to use and has the advantage of being able to take over 50 photos on its built in memory card. Downloading photos on to a PC is simple and the results are excellent. Pictures are clear with depth and good colour. All round its an excellent buy. I have a battery charger which wasn't supplied with the camera and this is a great advantage if one takes a large number of photos.|#|Can't really think of any.
6.0|#|Usual high standard of image quality from Nikon, more than the usual number of features from a compact.|#|Feels very light, body is black plastic and looks cheap for what is meant to be an entry level compact with manual features. Low light photography could be better. Flash often over exposes photos at night-time party shots. The usage of AA batteries isn't ideal but may suit some.
9.0|#|Takes AA batteries.  Has a viewfinder.  Uses SD cards|#|Need to take out batteries when not in use - they run down very quickly

9.0|#|Every conceivable feature in a compact camera|#|Would have expected a case with this camera
9.0|#|Excellent image quality especially for indoor portraits. I like the face recognition functionality. I have a Nikon digital SLR but sometimes I find it handy to take something a bit smaller when I'm out and about. Looking forward to taking this on holiday.|#|I'm sure there are some, every product has them, I haven't found any yet!
9.0|#|Excellent all round small camera giving excellent images.  Easy to hold and point and shoot with the option of using it as a camera which you set for yourself.  The GPS system worked reasonably well and I managed to use it all the time I needed to.|#|Silly case, you have to take the camera out of the case to use it rather than using the strap dangling in front of the lens.  The GPS drains the battery very quickly and if you forget to recharge it overnight you are rather stuck.
9.0|#|Easy to use with superb image quality|#|None so far
8.0|#|Very easy to use with built in light meter, programme mode also excellent for point and shoot. Once had turned of auto focus the pictures became a lot sharper!|#|Auto focus and gps a waste of time. Once these are turned off the camera turns from a point and shoot toy to a semi pro camera!

10.0|#|Very high image quality, deals very well with highlights and shadows. As an experienced SLR user (mainly Nikon) I am very pleased with the camera weighting and feel. It is a good addition to my kit.|#|So far not found any bad points - live view may have been useful in some circumstances, but is not really essential, a lens hood would have been useful but was not provided, and possibly an AA battery adaptor would come in handy for back up purposes. I believe both both  are available from Nikon.
9.0|#|This Camera is a good quality camera for the slightly more experienced user, but is also good as a point and click style camera in Auto mode.  There are enough options and settings for almost any type of photography and the image quality is superb.  Being a well established brand also means that there are a lot of accessories available that are tailor built for this camera so no need to buy adaptors and converters etc.|#|er well?

10.0|#|I love this camera, good value and great for a beginner intermediate snapper.  a great user friendly camera to develop your photography skills.  No live view shouldnt stop anyone, its not a video you want to make, its photographs! (and it only makes it too easy) ;)  VR lense is excellent!|#|nothing bad so far.
9.0|#|Good handling, easy to use, excellent image quality with access to many excellent Nikon lenses. Plenty of manual control if you need it and all the features most people apart from professionals will need.|#|A little plastic looking, others in similar price range offer more features but think carefully if you really need them. Some options could be a bit more accessible. No built-in autofocus or image stabilisiation so special lenses needed for these features.
10.0|#|Nikon D60 is a small size camera, for men and women alike, quickly ready to take pictures from 'On', no need to read the manual to start shooting as the operation is highly intuitive for anyone who has ever taken a picture and knows how to use a mobile phone. With one charge of the rechargeable battery I've taken more than 250 pictures with/without flash and no signs of discharge.|#|Body building doesn't feel too strong, just about right, so handle with care. Particularly the LCD display at the back. And still the system finds it difficult to focus with low lighting (although it warns you in the display).
8.0|#|Put the DX60 on auto and you get great results every time.  Develop your photographic skills and this unit will do everything you need it to.  Battery life excellent but didnt like being left in the boot of my car in sub zero temperatures!|#|It is expensive, but you get exactly what you pay for.  Accessories are also expensive
9.0|#|6- Super Dust control system built in|#|Not much but manual should include some extra information and examples for those people who want to use manual controls. I had to buy a book to learn manual controls.
9.0|#|This isn't quite an entry level DSLR camera nor is it a professional one but the quality and features it has on it are excellent giving you great quality pictures. If can put it in auto mode making it as easy as a compact only better images. Alternatively put it into manual mode and let the David Bailey in you come out.|#|As of yet i have not come across any bad points. If i was to be picky The number of focus points isnt great but knew about that when purchasing.
9.0|#|Image quality is very good and plenty of options on the camera.|#|I would like to turn the screen off, with a switch on the camera and use only the information in the viewfinder so I can preserve the battery power.
9.0|#|Feels well made, but quite lightweight. All controls work in ann intuitive manner. Menus are quite easy to navigate. The lens is really fantastic, focussing to only a few inches from front of lens, so almost macro shots are possible. The VR works really well, I have shots handheld at less than 1/15 of a second that are blurr free. This is my first DSLR, but I have always had Nikon film SLRS in the past. Really can't fault it for the price.|#|None really.
9.0|#|After using an upper-end digital compact for five years it is now a real pleasure to return to using an SLR especially with the speed of loading without apparent delays. As I hardly ever use flash the VR lens is proving a boon in low light,ie church interiors, candid family pictures, etc.|#|None provided a stand-by charged battery is available.
9.0|#|Easy to take quality pictures straight out of the box. Plenty of extra control for the more experienced.|#|Made me want to spend lots of money on other lenses to make it even more versatile!
8.0|#|In camera processing of both raw and jpeg images.   Sensor dust cleaning. Small and light but good handling.|#|focus motor, limiting lens choice.  No electric or cable release.   No live view, virtually standard these days.
8.0|#|using high capacity sd cards is great as memory cards are cheap and work with the majority of electronics.|#|it appears sigma have a number of lenses that fill the gaps if your willing to venture out from nikon lenses (the Sigma-HSM support the autofocus)
10.0|#|The camera is easy to use, it doesn't take long to get to grips with it the instruction manual is very clear and eay to understand making very quick and easy to start using the camera. I paricularly like the playback option where you can see the image you have just taken. This is brialliant for me as I have just started a Photography course and therfore I can instantly see if I have made a mistake. The camera is lightweight and all the neccesary buttons are close to hand. The lcd screen shows the images very clearly. I find the camera easy to hold it is not bulky at all.|#|
8.0|#|ensure a decent photo every time.|#|settings on the camera and be able to use them accordingly.
8.0|#|Excellent value for money. A camera body and quality lens package with an overall high image quality in a very compact DSLR.|#|No auto focus for earlier AF-D lenses
8.0|#|As an amatuer photographer, this camera has just about all the features you may wish to play with - along with legendary Nikon quality. In addition, in auto modes, it will get great results every time.|#|No live view viewfinder, but not a big problem, as you can snap away till your heart's content and pick the best overhead shot later!
9.0|#|As a beginner moving from compact digital to digital SLR it meets all my needs and is very user friendly and easy to use.|#|Not a bad point but I have yet to test it to it's full until I start to progress in my own learning.
9.0|#|The D60 is a fantastic starter SLR, it has enough features foing for it to make it interesting.  The 10mpx is great for the cost of the camera and I really like the raw processing built in the camera.|#|no bad points for a beginner
9.0|#|Wasn't for me, But My Boyfriend said it's the best present he ever had and seems to spend more time with it than me|#|He did spend a lot of Christmas reading the instructions manual to do the initial set up, but now it's set up, it's really easy to use and he really loves it
9.0|#|Is easy to use, has some great features and the VR kit is superb for short focal length shots.|#|the lack of Auto-Exposure-Bracketing so it's difficult to start experimenting with HDR imaging as the feature that is most commonly used to get your multiple exposures is missing, also the 3 point AF system is a bit lack luster as Canon has managed 5 and 7 AF point systems in cameras aimed at the same demographic.
10.0|#|This is my first D-SLR and at first I was not too impressed with the images; but I soon learnt that this camera has to be used in fully manual mode to really appreciate it's capabilities. I opted for VR lens and it really does take sharp true-to-life images. I think the D60 is built tough and I've already used it in wind/rain and on a beach with no fuss at all. I used to have film SLR and have a lot of photographic experience behind me (no expert though!!!) and overall feel this is a good first D-SLR that will allow me to enjoy my hobby and build a lens system upon. With the July cash back offer this camera worked out far better value than a Canon EoS 400d|#|Non, really nothing I'd change at all.
9.0|#|I have a Nikon Coolpix 4200 so I am familiar with Nikon point and shoot modes.  I have only used the D60 on auto so far and am pleased with the results.  The Vibration Reduction option is useful at full zoom.  The software program supplied is a big improvement on the 4200 Nikon View.  The ability to be able to use older Nikon lenses from my film camera was a deciding factor for me.|#|So far I have not come across any apart from getting used to a relatively lightweight body and a fairly large lens.
9.0|#|My first entry into DSLR territory for a trip to South Africa on Safari.  Although I haven't used about 75% of the functionality, I found the camera easy to use and began to experiment with some success!  I'd recommend this camera and lens to anyone looking to step up from compacts to DSLR.  PS - invest in a 300m zoom lens if you're going on safari -0 makes all the difference!|#|Haven't found a way to 'force' the flash tom opearete yet - but I probably don't need to?
9.0|#|It also has all the manual and advanced settings to keep the more expert photographer happy.|#|None
10.0|#|The build quality is excellent and the feel of the camera is very comfortable during use.  I am pleased with the immage quality and enjoying getting used to the manual features.  The vibration reduction lens is a very useful feature.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|much lighter and a little smaller than my D300 very suited for my young lady for her work (a school teacher, Drama) and her day trips out of school. Yet the pictures are as good as mine, without the fuss. Professional pictures without needing years of reading manuals  we also purchased Bert's cheat sheet for the D60 from  www.Photobert.com as I did for the D300 great help for the novice and professional too|#|

9.0|#|Good value for money. Amazing entry level DSLR. Good quality of pictures. The best choice, in my opinion, when upgrading from standard digital camera.|#|No live view - but i guess, lower price compensate for this.

9.0|#|Still experimenting!|#|None so far
9.0|#|The vibration reduction on the lenses makes it a dream to use.|#|cost is a bit too much over other manufacturers.
10.0|#||#|worried about LCD screen getting scratched so had to buy screen protector sheets - could these be provided with camera  because not very expensive in comparison and yet protect a vulnerable area of camera.
8.0|#|Easy to use, fast (everything focus/metering/startup, everything). Light, fits hands nicely. Good low light performance. Menus (mostly) easy to use. Focuses on the correct things, nearly all the time.|#|Auto white balance has limited range. Tendency to over expose slightly (but no worse than my previous camera) but is easily correctable.
8.0|#|Good range of features - this is my first digital camera.|#|Would have liked a better lens with the camera built-in to purchase price.
10.0|#|Size is ideal compared to other bulky Nikon camera's, picture quality is brilliant and is very user friendly. Very good camera.|#|None
9.0|#|makes taking good photos easy flatters the operator|#|
8.0|#||#|Seems a bit over priced compared to the D40, however I'm sure it will come down.
7.0|#|Lens and rapid shooting. Speed of write to the SD card.|#|Should use standard AA batteries. FEatures are limited compared to my Fuji S9600. Since it's all on a chip anyway why remove features.
9.0|#|The good points of this camera are that it is super easy to use ideal for the novice to the expert it has excellent mega pixel it basically tells you what to do if you need more light or more exposure. I would recommend this camera to anybody espesially with nikon doing the cash back one of the cheapest.|#|There are only a few bad bad points with this camera and they are the sound that it makes when you take a pic it sounds a bit plasticy and when you take a few photo's they don't process all that quick.
8.0|#|Well priced and easy to use.  Fast start up time and the vibration reduction system works very well.|#|It does take a while to transfer images onto memory card once the photo has been taken.
10.0|#|Having enjoyed using 35mm SLR in the past, and progressed through to compact digitals (with mixed results) the Nikon D60 is a superb follow on. The popularity of the D60 is understandable when looking at the quality and consistency of the images it produces - in all lighting conditions (superior to digital compacts I've used). The menu functions are easy to understand and use, with extremely useful help functions.  Build quality is of a high standard. The viewfinder is bright and clear, auto focus is quick and accurate.|#|None to date.
9.0|#|I liked the aperture-priority auto mode with the vibration reduction lens. It's easy to use and a feature not avaliable on my compact camera.|#|
10.0|#|For a first time DSLR camera this is an excellent choice. Very easy to use although I have used film SLRs for 25 years so I know how to use cameras. So far I have been very pleased with the image quality, focusing, exposure, etc. Highly recommended.|#|None really for a camera at this price.

8.0|#|Good battery life. Fairly easy to use for a digital SLR.|#|Additional Nikon lenses can be a bit expensive.
9.0|#|It is easy to use and a good starting point when learning digital photography. It will produce all the quality you need for an ammeter or for someone training professionally.|#|The low pixel count and the small sensor (1.5X smaller than 35mm) leave it a bit in the shade compared to the Canon.

8.0|#|A great camera for an introduction to DSLR - the Auto modes allow a 'point n' shoot' type camera, but in manual mode the full range of SLR photography can be used.  Nikon build quality is superb and the instruction manual comprehensive.|#|
9.0|#|Simple to use with good piture quality, ideal for a beginner or enthusiastic amature.|#|Lenses can be difficult to select with Auto focus feature. Need an AF-S which are some of Nikons most expensive.
10.0|#|My first DSLR camera purchaced and ready to use within 1 hour.  Easy to follow instructions and very user friendly for the beginner.  Not to big, so easy to transport around.|#|Poor photoshop type software to edit pictures on your PC.
10.0|#|Very easy to use for first time D-SLR budding photographers, with built in context-sensitive help button that shows a quick guide to the selected feature. Great to quickly get up to speed with the camera. Excellent sports mode burst shots from a recent rugby match. Superb motion image and focussing quality.|#|None so far!

8.0|#|Quality, sturdy but light, Long battery life, easy to use.|#|Wish you could have it on a setting like black an white or sepia before taking the picture - not after, but I have purchased filters for it so I guess I can use them... Besides that, all else is great with the camera.

10.0|#|Really easy to shoot cracking pics. A first time user can happily shoot away in auto mode, or someone more experienced can set their own shutter speeds and aperture to get the shots they want.|#|Could do with an LCD display at the top, but this does come on the slightly higher spec D90, so for the price, this is a really good pic.

I have to say that this fits the bill nicely!  It's a great combination of ease of use, features and price.  I'm very happy with it.|#|

10.0|#|Excellent entry level camera which has been easy to learn to use and has produced great results.|#|Personally, I haven't found any.
9.0|#|Its very strong in build. It dont take long to work out all the features and it really does take great quality pictures that you can blow up to A4 and lose no quality. Its perfect for the first timer and intermediate. You can let the Camera do the work for you as in setting up the shoot or you can play around with the manual settings and make brilliant pics.|#|Not really any, but at the time of writing this the D300 and D80 can be brought at this price if you look around
10.0|#|Excellent package - full of features yet easy to start using with great results.|#|
9.0|#||#|The way in which you view pictures on the camera can be quite irritating!!

9.0|#|Its a upgrade for me, I am still learning the finer points, I have taken some real nice photo's with it in Auto mode, going through the other modes slowly . Good buy value for money.|#|Flash not that good, need a external one to give enough light for indoor shots, My shots taken in a marque on a sunny day, came out dark, on auto mode
8.0|#|it's got the same basic controls as other (cheaper) SLR's so it's easy to get going. The image quality looks excellent.|#|None really. It'd be nice if the interactive feed back, when you go off automatic, gave more consequencial information, or feedback, on the effects of your choice will be.  But, the better answer is probably for the user to learn more about photography.

9.0|#|It takes great pictures, and once you've got to grips with all the settings its pretty easy to use!|#|I can't think of any!
10.0|#|Upon recommendation I purchased the Nikon D60 and have had no regrets. As an amatuer photographer the camera is extremely user friendly. However my use of it was much enhanced through undetaking a beginners photgraphy course in order to produce the desired visual imagery and to gain confidence in taking pictures.|#|Although the camera is user-friendly, it is useful to undertake a basic course in order to get the full use out of the camera. Some aspects of the instructions were not as self-explanatory as I would have liked.
10.0|#|Excellent variety of modes, screen on the back of the camera shows what it is doing if you are interested in going further.  Ideal starter Digital SLR camera.|#|

9.0|#|A good solid camera that produces clear pictures. Reasonable feature set, absolutely enough to deal with for the casual user. Adjustable flash level is great, my first experience with that kind of feature. Excellent value for money.|#|Auto focus can be a little off sometimes.
9.0|#|For an entry level digital SLR this was excellent value for money, good image sensor, wide range of features but with the ability to start to take good quality pictures immediately without being overawed by the cameras range of functions which can be learnt over time.  The lenses were excellent and for what many consider as a budget telephoto lense the Tamron 70-300mm is suberb and very easy to use, the macro function is extremely useful.|#|Having used the camera a lot in the last month in many different environments I haven't got anything to complain about at the time of writing.
10.0|#|Love the camera. It was ready to take photos as soon as it was charged which only took 90 minutes. Early results were very encouraging, beautiful clear LCD screen to review photos on and VR lens is amazing. I was able to take photos of my pet mice in the evening that came out very sharp. This would simply not have been possible with a regular lens because of the speed they move at and the fact that flash would hurt their eyes. I cannot recommend this camera highly enough, especially for someone upgrading from a compact like me.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|Easy learning curve, and the menu system is easy to navigate.|#|Addictive... need to buy more lenses...
8.0|#|Has a good blend of qualities at this price range for my step-son who is studying photography at college.|#|
9.0|#|As a total newcomer to slr photography i was a bit daunted at making the investment. However within 2 weeks I have managed to to produce excellent quality photos using the D60 and can even use the manual controls rather than the straightforward auto point and shoot mode. The camera is excellent build quality and as yet I have found no problems. The battery lasted for ages. Would recommend.|#|None found yet
7.0|#|Good value, rugged camera.  Great for a person who is just starting off with SLR cameras, and the extra telefocal lens doubles the fun and versatility.|#|The second telefocal lens sometimes has trouble focusing, and it is often better (or quicker in case you miss your opportunity!) to have the lens on manual focus.  Apart from that, nothing bad to report.
8.0|#|solid build. and quite easy to use. very fast start up times. pretty good image quality. overall, very good entry level DSLR. Standard 18-55 Nikkor VR lens is quite good.|#|doesn't give any kind of bracketing, which is quite bad... and Raw+Jpeg only gives gives the basic JPG option which i thinks is bad..

9.0|#|Great build quality, very robust.  Easy to use controls, though some features are hidden well away in the menus (but a bit of in-depth manual reading enables some quick access menus)  Good battery life.  Reasonable start-up speed from switch on.|#|None - a great all-round DSLR.
10.0|#|usual excellent Nikon build and quality.  Lovely to hold - fits a small/medium hand beautifully.|#|None I've come across yet.
10.0|#|I'm confident that being the owner of a Nikon D60 is helping me improve my abilities as a photographer and making the learning process really enjoyable at the same time.|#|If the D60 has any flaws I haven't been able to find them.  I'm really impressed with it.
6.0|#|The camera and supplied lens are very good.|#|The Tamron 70-300 lens bought as part of the bundle is rather poor on focusing speed in macro mode and quite often can't pick out the target.  The other problem with the Tamron 70-300 is the macro switch regularly refuses to disengage, this I find is solved by switching the AF/Man switch to Manual and turning the focus ring.

8.0|#|Ease of use and value for money|#|None as yet?
10.0|#|Fantastic Camera - very easy to use and the photos it produces are of a fantastic quality.  V'ideo footage isn't as good as it could be but this is irrelevant as bought for the stills.  great value for money when bought as a bundle with the 18 - 55 lens and the 55 - 200 lens - would have cost a lot more to buy all three products individually.  Overall, a fantastic buy.|#|Nothing that is truly awful.
10.0|#|Everything on D5000 is great and either a novice or pro would get on with this camera, i have only had this for abiut a month and have tried most  settings and video mode and its as good as other more expensive models, i looked at the 60D Canon but still went towerds the D5000, dont think just because its 12.3 MP as apossed  to some 18MP it will not produce as good as the others, also battery life is absolutley amazing|#|i cant find anything wrong with this camera at all
9.0|#|Purchased the Nikon D5000 with the 18-55 and 55-200 VR kit lenses. Only had the camera for about a month and so far I have been very impressed with it, especially taking pictures indoors.  The vari-angled screen I like very much and when closed protects it.  A very nice camera to handle and feels well built and solid, a quality product  with a  2 year guarantee. The on screen information is excellent in learning  how to use it.  I would not hesitate to recommend this camera and look forward to taking some great landscape shots in the near future.|#|None so far
10.0|#|Almost everything about this camera is brilliant, but the highlights are the super fast and accurate focus, the fantastic metering which gets it right almost every time, the wonderful built in flash that never seems to swamp the image and the simply superb build quality.|#|The Video recording facility is poor, but if you want to shoot video, get a video camera, this one is for superb stills.
10.0|#|So far I'm loving this camera (and bundle). The standard 18-55mm lens is fab for everyday use, and the 55-200mm came in really handy at a zoo at the weekend! I shoot mostly in Raw, so having the ability to shoot at 3-4fps in Raw was great, especially with moving animals.|#|My only gripe - and this is more down to me than the camera - is that it has so many features compared to my previous one that I'm still finding my way around all the options!
9.0|#|Great starter DSLR, fantastic value for money! This will keep me going for a few years at least.|#|Not full HD, but 720 is good enough
9.0|#|easy control over basic features|#|No built-in focusing motor
9.0|#|Haven't had the D5000 for long, but it is a very nice size/weight, easy to see screen, flatters my ability. Very good package with the two nice lenses.|#|Probably the guy using it! I haven't found any bad points, but as I say I haven't had it long.
10.0|#|Has lots of preset features so you can get going straight away. But do buy the for dummies book as it makes it all soo much easier.|#|
9.0|#|Loads of features for the amateur as well as good spec for more experienced user. Multi frame capture and video good|#|None I can find so far

9.0|#|D5000 is easy to use, friendly interface for beginner but the most important thing for a camera is of course the image quality and no doubt the D5000 is a solid performer. overall i am very pleased with this camera.|#|it could become a bit slow in changing setting after you get used to it.
9.0|#|Very easy to use, straight out of the box!|#|None really.
10.0|#|It is my first dslr camera and I find it brilliant. It is really easy to use, for first shoots you can use auto option, if you want quickly change settings you can use different scene options and if you want go creative you can go to more 'pro' options. Cant wait to use it on my holidays :)|#|

9.0|#|Excellent Camera, easy to use for the novice and yet excellent pictures|#|none
8.0|#|Got the twin lens kit for same price as single lens at other shops so a really good deal. Very useful having the 2 lenses covering most focal lengths you will need. Camera very easy to use. Most controls are intuative and everything operates with a reassuringly solid feel. Swivel / tilt screen is really useful and can be folded facing in to protect when not in use. Very impressed with the vibration reduction. Much better than the systems you get on compact cameras.|#|Slow to focus in live view and it is a little heavier than some of its rivals but not enough to make it uncomfortable to use.

10.0|#|This is my first DSLR camera as I have been learning slowly with the Fuji Bridge cameras for the past few years and I am very impressed with my Nikon D5ooo and the selection of lenses I can buy for taking photos. Easy to get you head around when your an armature like my self. Just wish the prices were a bit cheaper for the telephoto lenses as not all of us can afford lenses worth thousands of pounds. Fantastic Camera and look forward to taking many good photos with it.|#|Prices of some of the lenses is shocking but worth saving for.

10.0|#|i Love this Camera- I'm just not happy  with the Lenses I've got. I think i need something more in the 18-300 range which would give me greater freedom on the move, but that's obviously my particular requirement and not a fault of the bundle. The camera itself, in my opinion, is brilliant and I really wouldn't ask for more...... its a Nikon...... so what could one possibly say that would express the camera's qualities better than that?|#|other than that, no complaints so far!
9.0|#|Takes very sharp pictures|#|A little bulky
9.0|#|Its very well made and the focusing system is excellent.I have recently used the camera at a karting event and the autofocus coped without a hitch.Image quality is excellent and linked to the exposure/metering system its pretty easy to get some terrific shots.I have used it up to 2500 ISO with no noise evident even after some serious cropping.A great camera.|#|The continuous shooting at 4fps could be a little quicker and the flip out screen can hamper tripod/monopod mounting.Thats all really!

9.0|#|An excellent DSLR for the amateur/ semi-pro. Fairly simple to learn to use, feels sturdy and image quality is great especially with a decent lens. Video feature is good though not something I use often so can't comment much on it.  Overall excellent value for money, you will not regret buying this.|#|None so far

8.0|#|The bundle gives all required to take good quality pictures. For a beginner like me , I can not believe how great the pictures are by simply directing the camera to something picturesque and click. Very much recommeneded for all those who have an eye for good things!|#|The bundle also does not recommend any wires or card readers to be bought along with it. So was not happy when I did not see any wires.
10.0|#|Easy in auto but has the options to go fully manual, you would struggle to see the difference between a picture from this and a d700 (just takes a little more time to get it right with this)|#|None
9.0|#|Fits nicely in the hand and is well balanced even when using the Tamaron 70-300 lens. Very intuitive programs useful for experienced users and beginners plus full manual over ride should you want to experiment a bit and even 'live view' which can be very useful, having been a photography tutor with many years of experience I would advise potential buyers not to think of this as just a 'beginners' camera it has a lot more creative potential than is mentioned in the sales blurbs. Though not built in Japan the camera is solidly put together and has a good 'solid' feel in the hand well up to the standards one expects from a Nikon. Nice bright viewfinder and a handy diopter adjuster for those of us who need to wear glasses etc. Many things that usually only appear on much more expensive cameras.|#|No real bad points as all cameras have something which is 'not for you' or 'won't be used' as in some of the programmed add on's - I for one am a dedicated stills photographer and won't be using the camera to film movies etc - horses for courses and all that! But a basic memory card would have been a nice gesture (see below).
9.0|#|Ease of use and it is light weight and feels good to handle.|#|
9.0|#|It's our first time with a DSLR, although we've had good compacts in the past (Canon Ixus) but the images just from our first outing with the Nikon (country park, family shots, buildings, trees, etc on a sunny day) are astounding.  One of the portrait shots, which was almost a slip up, is beautiful.  It's pretty easy to use, although I have pured over the manual beforehand, you definately need to read up first.  A great first experience and looking forward to discovering more.|#|Not really a bad point but in a way it just doesn't feel like equipment worth as much as you pay for it, I can see the money goes into the optics, especially with the leap in picture quality, but the plastic body and lenses just feel a little flimsy.  Our metal bodied Ixus feels much sturdier.
9.0|#|manual modes. Though regarded as having ben superseded by higher spec models, the D3100 is still a great piece of equipment for the keen amateur.|#|D3300 have higher specification, but conversely there is price implications with these later models
9.0|#|Extremely easy to use, get started straight away! Fantastic first DSLR.|#|Not as high megapixel rating as the D3200, but this doesn't matter because the sensor is the same.
10.0|#||#|none
9.0|#|Great quality camera for the price, have had the camera now and I am really enjoying it.  The 18-55 lens is a great kit lens, however I am very pleased I bought this with the bundled 70-300mm lens though, as I find myself using this very regularly.|#|No AEB mode on the camera for HDR photos, however this is a minor issue as can be done manually with the EV compensation or in RAW afterwards.

10.0|#|not had a real chance to use it in depth yet but reading all the reviews i could and actually having in hand i feel its a quality camera for the price, a super bundle, and the on board camera manual is an excellent idea. all in all an excellent camera bundle.|#|for the short time i have had it my limited digital photography knowledge can not find any bad points at present.
10.0|#|Great twin lens package. Simple to use, great first DSLR in my opinion. This is my first fray into the DSLR world and am extremely pleased with my purchase.

8.0|#||#|A bit cross there was no memory card or waterproof wrist strap in the box and no way of knowing that they were not included before purchasing the camera.  this is daft because it is an underwater camera and bot items are pretty basic to being able to use it!

10.0|#|A perfect camera to play with in conditions where you certainly couldn't play with an 'everyday' camera. It was bought for my boyfriend who is in the military and he plans to take it on tours, on exercises through mud and rain and even skiing.|#|Finding out how to play videos taken was a little tricky but this was due to us being to keen to play rather than reading the instructions.

10.0|#|Excellent resolution, amazing images, true color rendering, robust construction, intelligent ergonomics, very fast, two cameras in one,one of the best batteries in the market, large number of custom settings. Programming instructions seem complicated at the beginning, become very easy after initial trying. Smart programming of the camera.|#|Limited ISO automatic balance- only between 100-800- works not well under fluorescent light, less accurate under other artificial light conditions.Built in noise reduction should be always activated at high ISO rates (1600 and 3200), otherwise noise levels become high.

9.0|#|Very easy to use. The camera has lots of different features to choose from depending on what kind of photo you want to take (Food mode, sport mode, portrait, night, sunny, snow, fireworks...just to name a few) although you can set the camera to automatically decide which kind of photo you are taking. The camera will let you know if someone blinked when you took the photo and ask if you want to delete and re-take. There is also 'smile mode' which allows the camera to take the photo as soon as the person in the frame smiles. I am only just learning about photography so find it very easy to use and excellent quality.|#|

8.0|#|Got this camera for a great price from Cdiscount - up to £100 cheaper than in some shops! Those this claims to be 'ruby red' colour, it certainly isn't red - more of a fushia pink - still a really nice colour though. Still getting used to this camera - used to using a Nikon SLR but wanted a small compact camera which would be much easier and portable to take places when I wanted to. Work with professional photographers and we use Nikons at work, so definitely wanted a Nikon.|#|Still learning my way round this camera - the first lot of photos are still not sharp yet, but it's hard for me to take photos looking at a screen. I take photos for my job and have used an SLR for many years, so it is very hard to try and get used to looking a screen away from you, rather than holding the camera up to my eye. But I know that will come. Otherwise, not really any bad points. Really like this camera

8.0|#|Good image quality, ease of use for quick snaps, good video|#|Like all very small, touch screen cameras it can be fiddly and the tap screen shutter release can result in unexpected images when trying to operate other control features.
9.0|#|The image quality is stunning, the lens is obviously wonderful.  The additional features over the previous model I owned are largely just complications but the upgrading of the pixel count makes for brilliant snaps, even under very low light where you can't use flash (galleries, churches etc.).  The bigger screen is lovely but I fear it will get very scratched up.|#|Editing features on the camera are a waste of time for me as it is so easy to bounce them to the computer . I really favor simpler systems without confusing controls.
4.0|#|A good looking compact camera that has intuitive controls and good features (5X optical zoom is very useful)|#|The camera is very sensitive and images come out blurred very very often.
5.0|#|Lots of features, well built, good for day-to-day leisure use|#|Digital zoom does not work on close-ups whatsoever! The wideangle lens takes a bit of getting used to, does take good pics but....anti-shake etc is not switched on by default which seems silly and is well hidden in a setup menu option. Very easy to press buttons when you dont mean to due to the way it is designed. Overall a disappointment for the price and the brand - i am a fan of the Coolpix series having had 2 before this one, but this is just not up to the usual spec -v- price for me, and if you have to do any close up work just dont go for this one!
7.0|#|It is simple to use, especially if you are already used to Nikon point and shoot digital cameras.|#|The zoom function is rather poor and does not focus well at all.  I bought this as an upgrade to a 5MP Nikon Coolpix digital camera and the quality of the picture is no better than that one.

10.0|#|This camera is very easy to use which for me is a definite bonus. It is compact so fits easily in a pocket. It takes pictures quickly which again for me is a bonus as I work with young children and quite often digital cameras are quite slow and when taking a picture I often found with other cameras that the picture was taken after the 'moment'. The picture quality is great. I love this camera and hope that it lasts me a long time :)|#|I don't have anything negative to say about this camera.

10.0|#|For me this camera couldn't be any more perfect. I am not a camera bod, for day to day usage, the picture colour, sharpness and quality are fantastic. It is extremely simple to use. Given this is a compact camera, the zoom is amazing giving good clear shots. I sadly dropped the first one about 3 times, pretty harshly (unintentionally) and it impressively survived the first 2 times! It was such a great camera, I ordered a new one, the same model as I loved it so much and def thinks it's great value for money.|#|
7.0|#|Compact, feels tough, can produce a good photo in good conditions. I usually use a Nikon D300s.|#|Pictures sometimes seem too green or too blue, but easily remedied in software. I dislike the picture delay compared with a SLR. The flash puts up just at the corner where I tend to hold it. And you have to turn it off to retract the flash.
9.0|#|It's a well made quality camera, easy to use and takes excellent pictures. The lenses are great quality, and the instructions are clear and easy to understand.|#|I find it strange that you can spend that much on a camera, and they don't include an SD card, even a 1GB one would be nice.
9.0|#|super slick operation, brilliant functions, great pictures, easy to use, looks great.|#|doesn't fit in my pocket!
10.0|#||#|- none

7.0|#|- Fast|#|- Is pink not red

9.0|#|This is a great camera. Like all of them, takes time to get used to the menus  - but these are much simpler than my old Nikon. Two stand out features for me - taking five shots and automatically choosing the one with the best faces, and being able to shoot video and take still images at the same time. Does a lot more than that but those two are big wins for me.|#|No built in flash so you have to buy the separate unit. Makes for a better shot but means the camera is that little bit bigger so less convenient to carry round. Also would be good if the lens cover could be attached by some sort of cord - worried it could get lost. But the pros far outweigh the cons - am very pleased with the camera and the quality of shots it takes.
9.0|#|For size it feels quite heavy and reassuring in the hand but a power house of features with raw available a very competent tool for producing fine images at speed...|#|No standard hot shoe, small sensor however very usable producing professional editorial level pictures even at 3200asa. Lens range limited. Available flash has low guide number and draws power from camera battery...

8.0|#|Excellent picture quality.|#|None yet, does what it says it does.
9.0|#|Superb macro action using auto focus. It has extreme low light capability. The flash has multi directional function.|#|Whilst the flash is good, the fact that the flash unit uses a hot shoe is sometimes annoying, it is not being built in the camera but is an attachment. If you are set up for flash composition then it serves the photographer well but as a point and shoot camera it is a bit painful for a one off shot.
9.0|#|small, easy to use. good image quality, well made and quite tough.|#|I think this camera should have been more aligned to experienced users. There are a few small issues that should be overidable but arent. Still a good camera though.
8.0|#|Very easy to use. Looks great. Viewfinder useful. No flash, but i accepted that. Electronic shutter is fast. Changing lenses could not be easier. Tele lens is good. 30mm lens is good all round lens. Menu system is easy to follow and make changes.|#|Big manual with a lot of extra features under the bonnet.

9.0|#|brilliant image|#|having to adjust the lens when turning on the camera is fine but also a bit annoying as it doesn't 'click' that well into place, when I open the lens too much and then retract it I quite often end up turning off the camera (as this is a good yet sometimes annoying feature!). Overall its a brilliant camera, wish they made a fisheye lens for it.

10.0|#|Unbelievable image quality, easy to use, a good solid feel with impeccable build quality. Certainly one of the best digital cameras in the world. It's not going to let you down.|#|The only downside is the price, but hey, if you can afford one, you wont regret it.
9.0|#|The amazing resolution fits very well with Nikon's latest lenses. It is superb.|#|It is heavy with a lense fitted

9.0|#|i've had a few digital camera's over the past few years, but this one tops them all, it works very well, takes great quality snaps and it is even satisfies my humble video recording purposes too!|#|the mains psu has to be bought seperately, and is a separate unit n addition to the battery charger, so there's really too much fiddly bits to carry around in a camera bag.

10.0|#|Having only bought cameras with the ability to use AA batteries (deliberately) I have been very pleased at the long charge time of the built in battery. This is a fantastic camera to slip in your pocket and not have a telescopic unit poking out to take a picture.A quality lens and a great viewing screen with easy to use buttons.|#|I found the Wireless feature rather clumsy to set up and although a friend conquered it I just use the base unit USB link, its  a quicker download.

8.0|#|Excellent screen, daytime shots are impressive|#|Struggles with pictures taken in low-light. Images are well exposed but often blurred

9.0|#|A camera whose pedigree shows.|#|If I have one gripe it's that the highly polished chrome shutter slide is a magnet for fingerprints, a nice touch style wise, but brushed aluminium would have been more practical.

9.0|#|Very easy to operate - High quality zoom packed into small camera - Sensible size/shape leading to good handling capability|#|Lens cover fragile
8.0|#|Zoom function very easy to use.  Zoom quality excellent.|#|Lens cover feels very flimsy and feel that it can be easily broken.
8.0|#|It's great to have a good optical zoom. LCD viewfinder helps in bad light and long zooms, but doesn't quite have enough definition to check focus.|#|The pre-defined mode settings are very comprehensive, but I can never remember which graphic is which, and I don't take the time to set it in advance. In hindsight, I would rather have a semi-manual option as I know how to adjust speed and aperture from my old SLR days. Also the mode dial gets turned when I put the camera into it's case.
9.0|#|Easy to use, brilliant zoom, good quality photos.|#|Camera shake on maximum zoom.

7.0|#|Overall I am pleased with the camera in all respects but one.  I have no complaints at all over value for money, image and build quality, features or ease of use.|#|My one complaint lies in the fact that due to glare, the image on the monitor is impossible to see on a sunny day.  As it doesn't have a view finder, the camera becomes completely useless in bright conditions.

Have used it loads in the month I've had it, no sign of the batteries going yet. Great sized screen for such a small camera.|#|Would have liked a matching case...
10.0|#|Camera is a good size and light weight and its features are easy to use and understand. Very good value for money for a camera with a reputable brand to be used for everyday photography.|#|I would have liked there to have been a complete instruction manual included rather than a cd version as not everybody has ease of access to a computer.

I find adjusting setting very logical, and with practice I think you should be able to do on the fly.If you are looking to go digital, or from compact and have not already another make of SLR with lenses, but have the cash this is the one to get, it just does not disappoint, if it does its you that has made a mistake, its that good. but it is a lot of money, but so are the prices of the opposition. For when I got it out of its box and started use it, it just had that wow factor, and most importantly you can see where your money has gone, where the others did not do that for me.|#|Mainly its cost, weight, and the vertical learning curve in getting to know all the different setting etc etc

10.0|#|Very easy to use if you don't want to fiddle around. Just let go on Auto. The photo's will still be great.|#|The ISO on Auto is a bit 'fierce'.
9.0|#|excellant price for good quality camera|#|nothing bad to report as yet
9.0|#|This camera will do just about anything a serious amateur could ever want; very flexible and easy to override the auto systems for those rare occasions when one of the wide variety of auto-exposure programmes is not quite right for what you, the photographer, wants. The menu system is a dream; it is by far the most imformative that I have seen and is very easy to follow. I haven't yet done any 'scientific' testing of the lenses but, subjectively, the optics are up to Nikon's usual high standard. The camera isn't heavy - a good point - but it manages to retain a feel of solid completence; another good point.|#|Not really a 'bad' point because it is important to remember the market at which this camera is aimed but it has to be said that although most Nikkor lenses will fit the camera, not all will work will with the camera's auto-exposure system and only special lenses with the built-in motor will operate with the camera's auto-focus system. Again  it's a case of the target audience but, although build quality is very good, this is not a camera that feels as though it would stand up to the punishing treatment that it might get at the hands of a busy professional.
9.0|#|Image quality, value for money quality package|#|None really, camera has good range of features but could maybe have one or two others

9.0|#|I love the D80, it is easy to use and gives great pictures for the enthuiast. I can see why people want to trade up to even more expensive models just to get even more pleasure from their photography.|#|I do wish Nikon's version of photoshop was included, rather than as an add-on.
8.0|#|I just love it.|#|
8.0|#|Very easy to get to know camera and it does not take a long while to master its features.|#|More expensive than other camera in its class range
9.0|#|Easy to use and a lot of options in you want to try something different not usual.|#|Weight, LCD screen would be perfect if it was moving (e.g. like in D5000)
8.0|#|I have moved up from a Nikon D40 so it was a big leap for me, Many good features,I have taken some great pics but its early days and I looking forward to using it and also increasing my photoshop skills to compliment it.|#|Used with the 18-200mm lense it is a little heavy but you'll get used to it.

9.0|#|light easy to use, some lovely features especially the projector|#|batterry is drained too quickly
9.0|#|Really sharp pictures, the projector is a great little addition.|#|menu is a little complicated, may need to re format your memory card to get the clearest pictures.
8.0|#|easy to use, nice quality shots, build quality is typical Nikon, projector is very cool... adds a lot of fun. Great for sharing your photos..|#|
2.0|#|The camera part seemed fine ..sharp image, easy to use|#|The projector feature was a real let down. Little more than a gimmick or a toy. Ok to project on to your living room wall but no more than that. They should not have released this product until they can produce a much brighter image to rival the larger projectors. As the camera was bought primarily for this, it was returned the very next day for a refund. Handled promptly and effeiciently but you don't get the [postage. Camera 10 Projector 0
