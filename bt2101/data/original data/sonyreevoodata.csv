Its a fun camera with a lot of features also for me it doesn't look like a big expensive DLSR and it is light this means i can take it to places i can't with a DLSR and worry about it getting stolen as much. It's a bit like having camo you can say its a £150 camera and people wouldn't question it.  Its a cool camera and most problems iv'e come across if found a solution for either via the menu or change in approach.|#|It's not a DLSR don't expect it to be one, when the camera goes to sleep it resets the lens, no timer on the HDR bracket feature but this can be fixed by getting a remote. no Mic in but again not a massive deal. You will find a lot of positive reviews on this camera and it does hold up well to them if you are used to DLSR's this camera will feel odd at first but it grows on you it is fun I jsut wish there was a wake sleep button rather than having to wait for it to sleep before you put it away as the EVF keeps the camera on if its in your pocket (maybe i just haven't found the option yet). In general Mirror less cameras have come a long way they don't replace DLSR's the boot time is too long compared.
10.0|#|menus are much easier to use than my previous Nex`s. Autofocus is impressive. More buttons, dials for easier adjustments. Zebra for videoing. Not too different from my other Nex cameras. Lovely Raw pictures with new sensor. Very interesting NR ISO...(I like doing night photography). Better low light shooting ability.|#|No touch screen which I miss a bit for focusing using the screen. No Microphone port. Again not a deal breaker as the camera`s predominantly used for photography however the video abilities are very impressive!
8.0|#|Compared to key rivals and overall package made this a worth while upgrade from canon G11|#|Expensive product but worth it for the quality of shots received
10.0|#|Easy to use and handle; the ability of a DSLR in a compact form.  The image quality is breathtaking and the Electronic Viewfinder helps the user to frame the perfect shot and get a brief glimpse of the image after the shot.  There are too many excellent features to mention but the professional test results and comparisons across many UK and US websites are testament to the outstanding features of this small but very capable camera.|#|Lacks the ability to charge the battery externally, but considering all the other excellent features this inconvenience is a acceptable compromise.
10.0|#|Fantastic Image Quality. Light weight and compact.|#|Some of the setting are a bit too deep in the menu system. Would be good to be able to assign any function to the fn button.

10.0|#|Great pet action shot feature|#|
9.0|#|Amazing zoom facility, panoramic sweep, ability to take macro photos, point and shoot or manual settings. Crisp, detailed images. Not bulky or heavy to carry.|#|As with most cameras without a built in viewfinder it's difficult to see the screen in bright conditions especially when zooming in on an object in the distance, even with the screen brightness set up properly.
9.0|#|An excellent camera to backup or replace your DSLR when you want a lightweight but configurable camera|#|Optional EVF is too costly
9.0|#|Light, easy to use, absolutely fantastic zoom, brilliant camera.|#|No view finder, optional extra to connect to hotshoe is approx. £317.00!! More than the camera cost!!
9.0|#|A wealth of features, innovative design and an outstanding optical zoom. Quality build and an instruction manual inside the camera.|#|The picture quality is very good indeed but the camera's image processing is evident if you zoom right in close. The movie record button can sometimes be pressed unintentionally. Minor issues though.
8.0|#|Sturdy camera. Quite easy to manipulate.   Good images.   Wifi great feature.|#|Movie button in awkward place - easy to press it by mistake.   Screen not easy to see in bright sunlight even when lighting altered.
9.0|#|A very compact camera that will slip into a big pocket., well built with many features. Incredible zoom range and very good image quality.

9.0|#|Compact, excellent image quality for class. good features and easy to use.|#|Cannot see the screen in sunlight. Really needs the viewfinder but WOW the viewfinder costs more than the camera and no one has it in stock!!

8.0|#|Almost everything|#|Software for Wifi Transfer wont work on an Apple laptop and their support on this is useless
10.0|#|Great zoom and easily fits in your pocket.|#|An integral viewfinder would complete a fantastic package, but perhaps that will come on the next one.
10.0|#||#|movie button is easily pressed by mistake.  only bad point
9.0|#|Very fast - rarely miss a shot. Unbelievably good image stabilisation -  hand held full optical and digital zoom shots perfectly acceptable. Image resolution is outstanding. Controls are easily accessible. Battery life is superb.|#|Colours can be a bit too cold. Screen very difficult to see in bright light,  even on level 5 (brightest).
8.0|#|Nice little camera, with good quality results. Zoom capability is excellent.|#|No view finder. Using screen in sunlight is a nightmare. Many times we nearly threw the camera away. We have a filter screen on, but still not good enough. Many photos are taken by guesswork.
8.0|#|Good all round camera excellent zoom ease of use|#|Cannot see viewing screen when in sun light.
9.0|#|Very portable and compact. Ideal for trekking and holiday's and produces some seriously good prints with a quality printer. I am very pleased with product. My days of carrying a bag of lenses and heavy camera are over.|#|Software could do with some work as it is a bit clunky but I am getting used to it. A sensible priced view finder would help as the LCD screen is difficult to use in strong sunlight. The LCD could do with being touch sensitive and tiltable. Requires work.
9.0|#|Nice chunky feel|#|It would be great to have an inbuilt viewfinder as it is really difficult to see what you are focussing on when there is bright sunshine.
8.0|#|Great pictures easy to use|#|Can't see the screen when bright sunlight. It needs a view finder
5.0|#|Good zoom. Excellent in low light situations.|#|Image quality is at best average. Not good in direct sunlight as screen impossible to see properly. Hot shoe a waste of time as accessories are expensive (viewfinder costs more than camera)
8.0|#|Excellent image quality... Stunning zoom feature which retains good quality even at full extent|#|Just too big to fit in your pocket.. But i didnt buy it for that so not really a negative.
10.0|#|Fabulously easy to use on the basic point and shoot concept.|#|No handbook that shows you how to use the advanced functions. I know there is the built-in on screen help but nothing beats reading a handbook and trying it out. The handbook that comes with the camera is far too basic.

9.0|#|Wide lens, exposure compensation dial, wifi connectivity, battery performance, panorama features, manual settings, 10 fps mode, steady shot|#|Recycle speed is awful irrespective of SDHC card type.

10.0|#|What a zoom. Couldn't quite believe the ability of this camera to zoom to the distance it did. Stood at Ravenscar near Scarborough and took a picture of Robins Hood Bay, must have been several miles away and the clarity of the picture on full zoom was great. The ability to take several images at once and combine is fantastic.|#|Haven't found any yet. Like any camera it will have faults but I haven't found them.
7.0|#||#|I haven't managed to use all the functions yet and wish the booklet contained more aspects to help me rather than having to search on the camera or on line. I have been in temperatures of 30 degrees plus and the camera has just stopped working so have been unable to close it. This is awkward on a sightseeing tour.
9.0|#|Great zoom length. Rapid focus.  Effective lo-light exposure.  Extensive in-camera processing.  Panorama thingy. good size with good heft. extensive options to configure exposures from intelligent auto to complete manual.|#|Can take a time to process. Some situations shutter lag
9.0|#|Fantastic zoom in such a compact camera|#|in many situations and will have to purchase a view finder to rectify this.  Really disappointed in this.  my mobile phone has a much better screen than this camera!

8.0|#|Excellent Zoom|#|None I can think of
8.0|#|As there are no instructions with this camera I have not been able to use it as much as I would have liked.  However, sounds fantastic and a really better alternative to my bridge camera which is too big and heavy.  I mostly download instructions, being rather old fashioned, but your download says no more than the paper which come with the camera. (I do know enough to press a few buttons.) I would have been a real asset to have had a few lesson from your site. Sony is usually so good at that sort of thing.  I will struggle on and hopefully be able to give you a better score as I go on.|#|As above

9.0|#|The AVHD movie quality is also great, but this is to be expected from a camera like this.|#|I have found the close-up focusing hard to figure out, but maybe I am expecting too much!
10.0|#|So far the camera has more features than needed or expected. Some of them are just amazing. But the main reason for buying was the zoom and the pixels, I have so say after having photos blown up on to canvas that the pics are amazing, whether in low light or bright sun. The auto modes are fantastic, but using the other features is really easy and simple. The connectivity through wifi is great for sharing pics on the go and also controlling the camera from a distance and taking pic (the phone screen shows what the camera is seeing) and allows you to to control the zoo  and flash and of course take the pic. Overall Sony has made a great camera, and is for anyone who wants the quality of a big DSLR but wants something pocket sized.|#|None the camera could of had GPS but its a small issue that is not a deal breaker. Sony's website accessories page has lots of great items to add, if ONLY they had stock, poor show Sony! Otherwise the camera is a must buy and I would highly recommend it all even the newest to digital cameras!
10.0|#|Takes very quick good quality pictures|#|Movie button keeps accidentally getting pressed, current location of button annoying. When you select SCN selection the scn selection menu appears on screen a short while then disappears, you have to turn the dial back to SCN selection to get the menu up again. Would be better if menu stayed visible until user decides they no longer need it.
9.0|#|Love the pano feature - especially in portrait orientation - very good results. I've only taken a 1000 or so shots but I'm pleased with the majority of the output. Not a substitute for a decent DSLR but it's combination of ease of use, weight and good quality output makes it a great walk-around camera. Worth every penny.|#|Despite the advertised big Megabytes, the picture quality is not a crisp as I would expect.

9.0|#|Great zoom at 30X. I like the 'sprit level' feature. Good picture quality.|#|I have to push a button to get the flash up and it can be fiddly to find and push. I also tend to hold the camera over the flash so amn having to train myself not to do that. The flash seems a bit overly bright but without it some pics are too dark and have to be lightened in Picassa. The on/off switch although flush to the camera body sometimes switches on as I'm putting the camera in its case. I often knock the right hand buttons by mistake.  This seems a failing in this sort of camera but this is better than my Panasonic TZ5.

9.0|#|Very good quality video recording with mp4 option. Good sound quality on the video recordings. Ability to take photos while taking video is very nice. A nice front opening case is available for it.|#|The image quality when zoomed in appears to have a slight oil painting blurriness even when focused rather than having a sharper pixel image, causes some sharper lines to be broken up. The viewing screen is very glossy and so reflects a lot of light and has been hard to see on a bright sunny day. Doesn't have a slow motion (High frames per second) video option which would be nice even if not high definition. The file numbering system on the camera is strange, it would be nicer if it remembered the latest number so that when files are removed it wouldn't reset the numbers. As when I transfer files I find they have the same numbers and have to rename them.

10.0|#|I'm not a photographer and bought this as an upgrade on a whim from a Panasonic TZ10. WOW after good advice from a photography retailer  and reading internet hype and checking out Blunty on Youtube I took a very nervous plunge with a raised eyebrow from my wife I might add.  I took this camera to Dubrovnik, almost everybody else had a DSLR and I was pondering had I bought the right camera? Well having gone through my pics on my Mac now I'm back home I'm blown away I'm not kidding you but I genuinly think I could pass off some of my shots as professional. Night shots and macro are simply amazing, I will post some shots on DP review as soon as I get time.|#|Like I said I'm not a photographer that is why I gave it an 7/10 for ease of use as I had to work it all out for myself Sony COULD and SHOULD have given you a CD or manual rather than assume by the price that only experienced photographers who knew what they were doing would buy one therefore not need instructions!
9.0|#|This is a fantastic little camera. It's a triumph of engineering that such a small camera can deliver such quality and so many features. I would rate it at 10 across the board apart from the single 'bad' pont mentioned below.|#|So I was a little distressed to find two signficant scratches on my RX100m2 after having the camera for only 3 days. I've ordered the Sony protective sheet and will of course be fitting it, but don't understand why the RX100 is apparently far less scratch-resistant than other screens.
8.0|#|solid build which feels nice|#|Pop-up flash, USB / HDMI connection covers flimsy would be better if sliding.

8.0|#|Function button cycles through your commonly used controls and is customizable. Quality of images are superb.|#|the instruction manual is pathetic. I can't believe such a complex camera comes with so little help on how to use all the features. Perhaps Sony are convinced that all the customers for this camera already have experience of other Sony cameras and are already experienced in the many included features.
8.0|#|Superb, pocketable little camera. You won't believe the quiality of file you get from this given the size of the camera|#|With there was more control over focus, oh and a viewfinder on this would have made almost perfect!

10.0|#||#|slightly overpriced when compared with the competition
5.0|#|Small, quiet, good image quality|#|This camera is meant to replace an entry level camera and a more advanced camera but seems to fall between the two regarding features. If you want or need to stay with Sony it may be better to try to find a Sony Alpha 57 before they disappear. Ultimately, if the compatibility issues are not an issue and you are comfortable with the electronic viewfinder, there is nothing which is actually wrong with this camera and you could well be perfectly happy with it but I am left with the feeling that for the same money you can do better.
9.0|#|A really good quality EVF. A nice improvement over the A57's LCD EVF, now with a bright 1.44m OLED type.It's not that far from my Nex-6's 2.3m EVF to be fair, which is an outstanding view finder. However, if you have to have an OVF in your DSLR/T, then this is a mute point!|#|Poor buffer size, fills up quite quickly when on burst mode. Five FPS is OK against it's peers, however quite a drop from the A57, which also had a much bigger buffer. It can't be just down to a 4MP increase in image size, must have been a cost cutting done by Sony to reduce the buffer.
9.0|#|Added a 35mm f1.8 sony lens for chasing my 2 yr old round and getting some beautiful shots.|#|No wireless remote available yet.
8.0|#|Bets low budget camera I have ever used for still images.|#|The video function is the worst I have used on any DSLR.  Since videography is my main interest, I am quite upset as I have to sell the camera and only having a limited budget means my next product won't be a Sony.  Either improve or remove the movie function.  I understand that the entry level model can't match the next product up the ladder but the video feature on the A58 is truly dreadful. .
10.0|#|The Stabilisation is great for taking pictures in your hands, all images come out crystal clear, almost impossible to get any camera shake in pictures. The 1080p HD videos are impeccable!|#|It can be quite difficult finding the setting you want on the camera because everything on the screen looks quite scattered, but thats the only bad point though.
10.0|#|Really, really easy to use to get superb photos... just a bit fiddly to find all the settings when in fully manual mode. Produces pictures of a similar to higher quality than those from a camera two or three times the price. Light enough to be carried almost anywhere and the wide choice of lenses available is also good (can also be increased  by buying an adaptor for other lenses off internet to use Canon and Nikon lenses too!)|#|Image quality seems a bit grainy if you zoom in on PC after taking pictures, especially on higher ISO. Also, because Sony have only just released cameras with the Multi socket (instead of remote shutter socket) finding compatible remote shutters is only possible through the Sony website using genuine Sony products (very expensive!) but this should sort itself out over time as manufacturers design products to fit the new connector.
10.0|#|One brilliant camera! Before buying, I was sceptical about the TruView Viewfinder, but.putting this camera in the field and going hands On has opened my eyes to the brilliance of such a system! The image quality is superb, the in-camera HDR is superb, the ability to use some Minolta Dynax lenses that were passed down through the family to me is great, especially as a student who cannot afford £800+ lenses on top of the camera itself! The image quality is what struck me the most, and the sheer beauty that comes out in my shots really boots the overall image. I will never consider another technology brand again!|#|Only a very minor point, but one that does bug me a bit is the plastic body. Although the textures hand-grip is different to the rest of the body, if it was all a brushed sort of metal, or a really high quality, premium feel plastic, this brilliant camera would be even better.

There is a Sony very expensive one but no compatibles and with doing concerts it is quite important. Also the conection from lens to body is plastic so great care to be taken.
9.0|#|I like the software for downloading images to my PC.|#|It is a complex camera and it is going to take me a while to get round to all the features.  I think it would have helped if I had a guide written in simple English to help when I first got started.  Initially I just wanted to point and shoot - using the automatic features.  Effortless good photos - I just have to frame the picture.

8.0|#|Lightweight; stylish; good technology (it's Sony ^-^); takes pictures very fast; help features ('?') very good; research showed that in some tests some pictures came out better than Nikon and Canon cameras in a similar price range.|#|Screen res. is a let down (it's lower than the iPhone 4?!?!) - how can Sony (who make Bravia T.V's) release a camera with such a small resolution on the lcd screen? - quite the let down; also, the inner left hand side of the circular button for accessing WB, DISP etc. is very close to screen - finger gets a 'little' hampered; the proximity sensor [for the automatic switch from viewfinder to lcd] is to short - it changes to and fro when you reach for the menu button;
9.0|#|Extemely easy to use when you change the mode your given an overview on the LCD screen of that mode. The quality of photgraphs is exception nearly every time. Playback of photo's has a zoom so you can see the subject clearly - I think this is a great facility.|#|The cover for the Microphone Jack, HDMI Jack and USB port is a flimsy rubber affair why Sony have not used a more robust plastic cover confounds me, it is only a matter of time when this will fall off even now it will not stay in place.

4.0|#|An extremely compact camera with operating features of a more advanced camera.|#|Lens accuracy/quality - it is not consistent across the zoom range.  The image quality varies from very good at 28mm to very poor at 100mm.  The longer focal lengths are only marginally improved by stopping the lens down to F8 or smaller.  This makes the camera only marginally better than other pocket cameras I have owned.
9.0|#|Just the latest release and havn't had m.uch time to try it out..if it lives up to its reputation it should be a winner My older Sony a Dsc F828 has given excellent service, the RX100 is a 1/4 of the size with higher specs|#|Sony are making the most price wise with the demand for the latest release, I think its standard practice in the electronics industry.
9.0|#|Battery life - I bought a spare (Sony original) battery but rarely need it. BEWARE - lots of forgeries on the market - only buy from reputable dealers and not via Amazon unless you really trust the vendor!|#|A bit expensive but it's a great camera!
9.0|#|Takes great pictures. Excellent zoom for a compact. Easy to use. Looks good.|#|Dedicated/fitted case was a bit pricey but on the plus side gives the camera a kind of retro look.
9.0|#|This is an absolutely brilliant camera. The resolving power of the lens and sensor appears to be better than my Sony NEX7 fitted with a 50mm prime. I would be reasonably happy with the quality of photos from this were it my main camera.|#|Start up can be a bit slow. It's a bit unresponsive when you switch off. Key functions are sometimes a bit difficult to find amongst the menus. There are things that it can do which I still haven't found - it would have been good to have a proper paper manual.

9.0|#|Great product does what it says on the box, a bit pricey but worth it for the Sony build quality|#|Online and in camera instructions are very poor
9.0|#|The most beautiful image quality, especially in lower light.|#|The battery is a little suspect, and its requirement to only charge in-camera, and its rather poor display characteristics to determine when it is full or half charged, or near empty.
9.0|#|Brilliant image quality - solid build - small and fits easily in a pocket|#|Flash location - if not careful you could drop it in 'shock' when the flash pops up in the position your fingers hold onto the camera.

9.0|#|I wanted a pocket size replacement for a DSLR for when I am travelling and this camera is certainly pocket size. Build quality is great and it feels solid in the hand with sensible control layout. Image quality is far better than any other true compact I have tried and rivals the budget DSLRs. Full manual control and RAW image capability are useful, and the 10fps is handy for sports days and action shots. There is also a sweep panorama which I find myself using more than I thought I would! The digital zoom quality is better than expected and the rear screen is very clear even in bright sunlight. Ability to charge from a PC/Laptop is also handy.|#|spare battery.
9.0|#|Brilliant clear images, Great screen, Good software (On baord info on each setting. Great auto but also manual controls.|#|Ergonomics for me not good. I find the flash pop up is exactly where you are likely to want to hold. I would like the unit to have a better hand hold or grippier area where you place hands. All to easy these days to suppose we all want smaller and smaller whereas i prefer ergonomics.

9.0|#|Image quality excellent, size, weight, fast lens, intelligent auto program, night scene programs, large sensor|#|Menu is not the easiest to navigate, the white balance setting is very difficult to reach which is very important for me as an underwater photographer, other manufacturers have made this feature a single button function , Sony need to release a firmware fix for this ASAP. The close focusing is not as good as the Cannon S 100 etc and the lens is not as wide either at 28mm , could have been 24mm.
8.0|#|Great photos quality for the size|#|Lack of zoom.
9.0|#|convenient so easy to have with you at all times making it very useful.|#|Poor native aperture at the tele end of the zoom range.
9.0|#|Superb build quality and picture quality, nice small pocketable camera.|#|Can be a bit slow at times , depending on what your asking it to do .
9.0|#|Good solid feel, excellent images, very good in low light.|#|None.
8.0|#|Reassurance that it is the best at the moment for the price.|#|Unavailability of parts yet, such as filter holder and battery charger.
6.0|#|pocketable and worth it|#|
8.0|#|Very well made, small, light, 1.8 lens, shoots raw, good full manual control. Loaded with features.|#|The panoramic mode should allow a second shutter realise press to end the panoramic scan rather than have to do a full 180 degree scan.
10.0|#|Image quality is immense, got published from taking photos at a festival from in the crowd. Features are very similar to my Sony A77.|#|Not weather sealed.
2.0|#||#|instructions - I would prefer to read how to use it in detail on (say) adobe. I went on the Sony site for detailed instructions but what I got was simply a repeat of the skeleton download that came with the camera - is there anywhere I can find what I want (and need)
9.0|#|Its ability to take excellent night-time shots, thanks to its large and low noise sensor|#|Getting used to the myriad of functions and switching between them quickly
9.0|#|discounted price, flexibility, features, smallness|#|buttons a little fiddly
10.0|#|all good.|#|no bad points.
9.0|#|Truly pocketable compact camera with stunning image quality and robust body. Nicely inconspicuous to use in public, compared with a CSC or SLR.|#|At this price point WiFi and touchscreen capability really ought to feature by now. The latter would help immensely with navigating the rather longwinded menu. Micro USB and HDMI port covers are too flimsy. Desperately needs a rubber handgrip on the front.
8.0|#|Great picture quality|#|Bit confusing to use sometimes and not sure how the selection ringworks
9.0|#|Full manual control when required. Well designed, easily accessible controls. The focusing is rapid for a compact camera. The Zeiss lens ensures good image quality. Accessing the menus is straight forward, and menus are clear and easily followed.|#|For me, there are no bad points worthy of note.
10.0|#|Compact size, elegant and understated design, superb picture quality, nifty set of features, simple to use|#|1 or 2 of the shooting options seem duplicative - what's the difference between auto and auto+ ?
9.0|#|superb clarity and lots of features in such a wonderfully small camera. 20 pix and 20 mag is just fantastic|#|I would have liked a proper carry case which fits on  my belt but I found a quite flimsy one in Cley. The earlier model had a better case.
8.0|#|compact, picture quality and ease of use|#|control dial on back of camera has failed
8.0|#|Image Quality|#|Complicated Menus
9.0|#|Really good low light performance|#|A bit on the dear side
9.0|#||#|The cover for the plug is weak
8.0|#|Excellent image quality, robust camera|#|Zoom a bit weak, off-on starting slow, absence of manual in French and German
7.0|#|Image quality, size|#|Had to add finger grip to improve holding
8.0|#|Excellent images at low ISO. Great HDR. Good lens. Compact with muscle. Will never regret buying. Stylish.|#|Considerable noise at high ISO which was a surprise on such a high spec camera
9.0|#|Hi specification and good quality results are apparent from day one.  The compact design is ideal for my work. Point and shoot works well for my professional use and is a good compliment to my Nikon for my hobby use.  Ideal when I go out with my family.|#|Concern over fragility and dust/water contamination.  Other cheaper lower spec cameras offer waterproof, dust-proof and shock proof.  I am still struggling with the focus facility in particular when ambient light is bright - confident this will improve in time
8.0|#|Maybe the best compact camera currently available.|#|The manual and instructions. Absolutely appalling. Possibly the worst I've ever seen. Such a shame a great product has been let down by the lack of thought and investment in a fundamental service - In this case, a good customer manual.
8.0|#|Large sensor, relatively compact size|#|I prefer a separate battery charger
8.0|#|Superb pictures|#|White balance controls
9.0|#|This a great camera, great picture quality, well made and took many thousand photo's whilst overseas. It reminds me on my much loved DSC-V1 another camera that broke new ground when it was release in 2005.|#|Some of its processing options resulted in strange duplicated photos that tool a long time to process, and I spent a lot of time deleing the shots I didn't want. Needs a touch screen that can articulate and more control over the lens ring.
8.0|#|Very Compact. Generally very good quality images|#|So many features/menu options.
8.0|#|Muli-metering options; compact size; lens; built-in spirit-level|#|Price
9.0|#|Only had it in use for around a week so not used to all the options yet but, excellent quality photos.|#|Lack of optical viewfinder
9.0|#|Compact size, excellent photo quality, superb travel camera.|#|Really needs a grip
9.0|#|Excellent image quality due to larger sensor in such a compact package.|#|Poor screen visibility in bright sunlight.
9.0|#|Pocketable, excellent build quality. Offers image quality that you wouldn't expect from such a small camera, thanks to the comparatively large sensor and bright Carl Zeiss lens.... And very sexy to boot. Great as a back for dslr users or as a main camera for those who like good things in small packages.|#|No tilt-able screen, no off camera battery charger supplied. Sonys leather case and spare batteries are over priced.
9.0|#|it is really easy to use, ligth and well manufactured|#|
9.0|#|Size|#|LCD screen not twistable
9.0|#|The picture quality is on a par with my DSLR, only the flexibility of my lenses on the DSLR gives it the advantage. Sony exceeds expectations on low light shots and I am very pleased with the HDR and dynamic range options.|#|None yet.
10.0|#|DLSR In compact body|#|None
10.0|#|4) Amazing camera in all areas of use.|#|None. It really is THAT good! Worth the money.

10.0|#|Takes great pictures easily.|#|None
9.0|#|very small|#|
8.0|#||#|Not recommended for people who have normal sized hands.
8.0|#|The capability to shoot in RAW is one of the camera's best qualites. The camera feels very solid and it is filled with features which I feel sure will enhance usage once one has mastered them all.|#|The camera is difficult to hold steady due to its small size and the pop up flash makes it more difficult to hold if the flash is required
8.0|#|Wonderful picture quality|#|Lens ring is diddly and pretty much a gimmick.
8.0|#|Ease of use, solid body, clear pictures, full manual. I like using the ring dial to review the photos. Quite like the flash but don't use it much.|#|Difficult to use screen in sunlight- viewfinder option would be nice. I sometimes end up changing the settings by mistake when I'm wandering the streets with camera in hand- especially with the dial (ring). It would be nice to have a thumb and finger grip for ease of holding for a long time. Would be nice to have a separate battery recharger. More weatherproofing would be good. A better designed menu would be good (have the delete all option on the first screen).
10.0|#|image quality, ease of use. features all are exceptional in a camera of this size.|#|hard to find, i would like a larger zoom
6.0|#|good quality photos|#|the flash is in a stupid position ... its where your fingers go ....

8.0|#|Compact.nice design and layout,overall satisfied,maybe spoilt being a Leica user, for many decades until now!|#|Lack of handgrip, had to import from USA.lack of battery charger, had to buy separately plus battery,capacity poor if using RAW+ F. Flimsy access to card and battery,same for cover to charging point.Lens although excellent could be slightly wider say 24 mm and faster at top end.Could affect compactness ?!.Flimsy,strap.
9.0|#|Excellent video quality|#|Lots of features and modes can overcomplicate
9.0|#|Image quality|#|Ease to use
9.0|#|I had bought a new Canon G1X but it was too big to carry about all the time and although it has a bigger sensor than this Sony I genuinely feel the pictures are much better.|#|Only a couple I have found so far, one is the smooth top to the shutter button, I would have preferred a concave top so that I can be sure my finger is on the right button rather than on the on off switch. Second issue is the lack of a printed manual, ok so I can download the manual but it's not the same is it? Ive had the manual printed and bound but the layout and format doesnt lend itself well to printing with many wasted pages.
9.0|#|Love it, its so portable and the images that it takes are superb|#|Poor user manual that has forced me to buy a bbok on the camear and how to get best out of it
8.0|#|The highest quality for a compact size camera|#|Ergonomy relatively poor
8.0|#|Superb image quality.  Well built camera.|#|Not weatherproof.  Some options can be hard to find.  Not all options available in RAW.
5.0|#|The Sony RX100 has a good image quality at low light, a lot of features (that you can't always use if you are shotting in RAW format, it is small.|#|Easy to let it slip from your hands
9.0|#|Pictures are amazing straight out of the camera (almost better than my mid-entry level DSLR). A wealth of features. It's small!!!!!! It's definitely a carry everywhere camera. Easy enough to use so that it's easy to focus on taking pictures and not the camera. Customisable my FN button is now set so that I have fast access to my frequently used functions.|#|The navigation around the menus isn't the greatest and could have been designed better. Don't like charging via a USB. I brought an external battery charger instead. Could have been touchscreen (this would have helped the menu issue too).
10.0|#|Shoots Raw images, fabulous depth of tone and detail!|#|Not Sony's fault, but Adobe haven't produced RAW plug in for CS5. Have to use DNG converter!
3.0|#|Great image quality for the size, which can approach a DSLR. A very comprehensive feature set. I particularly like the focus peaking with manual focus.|#|message.  Perhaps mine is faulty; I wish I had returned it within 30 days. It is going back to see if there is a fault.
9.0|#|Amazing Image Quality from a tiny camera that can sit in a belt case when walking around in shirtsleeves.|#|Menu system complex with features somewhat hidden away
6.0|#||#|No printed manual
9.0|#|Quality shows better on prints; I'm awaiting these from a professional lab so it is difficult to comment yet. The camera is light (in weight) and has all the features that make photography easy. The pixel count is high so resolution should be very good. The Sony case is exellent: it is effectively an ERC (an ever ready case)|#|The flash is just where I hold the camera but it is easy to allow for
1.0|#||#|Easy to hit the video button by mistake.
9.0|#|nice camera all round|#|price of Sony,s camera  case  very expensive
8.0|#|good quality video|#|it doesnt have a function to do timelapse, this is quite a major overlook that could easily be included in the firmware
5.0|#|Great camera with super lens.|#|I think I was sold a defective model. The shutter doors didn't close after a weeks use, the camera asked to restart due to dropped sensor and numerous problems. As I am on a 3month holiday and bought especially I am very unhappy.
8.0|#|Compact but versatile.  Top quality images in a wide range of circumstances.|#|A complex bit of kit so needs a printed manual.  I had to buy a £15 book to appreciate its capabilities, which is really annoying.  Would be nice to be able to switch off the movie button; it is too easy to engage by mistake.
9.0|#|If you value picture quality jusst buy it. You won't be disappointed|#|Cost.
8.0|#|Looks, size, weight, image quality, menu selection, bright lense, video quality and value for money.|#|Grip which is poor on front of the camera for one handed operation and the flash pop-up interferes with the forefinger position, mine anyway. Menu can be confusing. No view finder (sun causes problems no matter what the screen setting).
9.0|#|Fantastic picture quality, can shoot in RAW.  Great stability in HD video recording.  Looks beautiful, feel lovely and takes a perfect shot everytime|#|Price could be cheaper, Battery charger would have been good.
8.0|#|Features, image quality, good balance between size and image quality, overall a great second/portable camera|#|Lack of grip (too smooth body, slippery with moisture)
9.0|#|So much technology and high quality packed into such a small camera it's unbelievable!|#|'Feel' of the body - it's smooth metal and being such a small camera there's not much to 'hold' it with as most of the body is either viewing screen and controls on the rear or lense at the front - could have done with some textured grip and I would feel more confident that it wouldn't slip out of my hands.
8.0|#|The camera takes good pictures and can be fairly straightforward|#|There is a multiplicity of choices - for an amateur!
7.0|#|Lack of noise on higher ISO|#|Difficult to hold, constantly hitting the video record button when trying to zoom, thus starting a video recording when not required.
8.0|#|better than other compacts by a margin worth having bought it for. Additional features also well worth having.|#|Zoom on looking at photo is not progressive in enlarge direction, but goes immediately to full zoom making it difficult to know where you are in the frame - it become neccesary to ' dezoom' first to know this in many cases.
9.0|#|Extremely good to have when you are taking pictures of kids. The photos are clear!|#|Expensive
8.0|#|Quality of the image for a compact|#|Lack of handbook.    Flash usage
8.0|#|RAW shooting|#|
8.0|#|Awesome image quality for such a small compact.|#|Plastic trap for the battery, the adjusting ring is slow.
7.0|#|Fits in my shirt pocket - even in a zip-up case.|#|Too many jpeg only features. Features are good but need to be available in raw.
9.0|#|Too many to mention!|#|Whilst the software works in it's own sorting modes this arrangement of importing is very odd.  Especially if you want to view the images using another make of software or use it alongside an existing arrangement.
9.0|#||#|Response to circular lens control rather hesitant
10.0|#|Easy to use manual controls|#|Needs connector for remote release and optical viewfinder
9.0|#|Loads of options and presets, all of which work very well|#|Would have awarded 10/10 had it had an optical viewfinder
9.0|#|Fantastic results for such a small camera|#|Not enough information about its features. I had to buy a book to find out the advantages of the camera.

8.0|#|over all easy to use.|#|you are shooting.very disappointed.
9.0|#|Picture quality excellent. Movie quality also excellent.|#|Control buttons fiddly and confusing.
10.0|#|Sony RX100 produces excellent images, has many features and offers ample scope for manual control. The control ring works extremely well. It feels like using a DSLR - and yet it is so small and light.|#|None discovered yet.
9.0|#|Full set of features with intuitive user interface|#|None for a compact you can get in your pocket
10.0|#|size is perfect|#|its slippery
10.0|#|Image quality fantastic, colours and focus superb. Easy to slip into your pocket. All the modes and more you would ever need and all of these easy to access.|#|No viewfinder, and easy to slip out your hand, although a good hand strap sorts it out.
8.0|#|compact, image quality|#|zoom only x3,8
9.0|#|Excellent for general purpose photography - results equally as good as a much larger DSLR.|#|Close-up/Macro not good but I didn't buy it for that!
8.0|#|Very good in low light conditions.  This is a feature that I've been looking for in a compact camera for quite some time.  It can still produce an image, though grainy, in very dark environment.  That I thought was pretty cool.|#|I have a tendency to put my index finger over the area where the flash is.  Need to change my habitual way of holding a camera.
7.0|#|Image Quality is excellent and exposure seems to be pretty good based on current experience.  Speed of operation is good.|#|Holding camera is awkward.   Some kind of grip would be useful.
7.0|#|Image quality and low light performance. Ready to shoot quickly. quick response to shutter press. High audio recording quality.|#|Dificult location of the movie button.  Battery/card door opens accidentally. Spends too long 'processing'.  Too many photshop type features loaded on the camera.  Should include carrycase.
9.0|#|The basics...lens, and particualrly the sensor|#|Would like lens to remain fast in zoom but I guess that would make it heavier.
10.0|#|Perfect for the pocket.|#|Found that my left hand finger naturally rested on the flash release ( top of camera )  struggled to adjust but will have to work at it. It has not put me off this lovely camera.
9.0|#|Luminosity, sharpness, vidéo|#|- US 110V plug in the pack instead of European 220V plug
9.0|#|image quality is excellent|#|The flash unit is just where one naturally holds the camera and when it wants to 'pop up' it is delayed by fingers and flash is ineffective.  Eventually will learn to hold it so this doesn't happen but frustrating at the moment.
8.0|#|Compact size, ease of use and photo quality.|#|ISO adjustments seem to require use of menus rather than direct dial.
9.0|#|Very good image quality for a compact camera. If you like to post process your photos even JPEGs are good enough for processing. Good High ISO. Large sensor allow some nice background separation (for a compact camera off course) RAW pictures. Very easy to use, and to operate in manual mode. Very small and handy.|#|Lens could be brighter at longest zoom.
7.0|#|Image quality, autofocus performance, lowlight ability, pocket size.|#|Ridiculously high price of Sony case.
9.0|#|Great for low lighting pictures i work offshore and cannot use flash it great for survey pictures in low light conditions menus are clear to use, the large ring adjuster is good from adjusting light levels.|#|could come with more screen protectors or cleaning cloth
9.0|#|Fantastic photo quality especially in low light.Easy to carry with you without the bulk of a DSLR Many features for the advanced amateur or for the point and click fan, faultless.|#|None
8.0|#||#|two versions US ( 60Hz) and europe ( 50Hz) I got a US version and could not make movies playable in Europe. Had to send it back.
8.0|#|Size|#|Edge image quality not great
9.0|#|Excellent image quality ; small enough to take anywhere.....so much better than a cumbersome DSLR. Superb build quality.|#|Some sort of optical viewer attachment would have been useful.
9.0|#|HD TV when I got back home, even the audio wasn't awful!|#|The only real bad points are battery life (I'm used to longer, it is still very good) and the lens range - that is mainly because of owning an SLR as well, I'm used to nearly always having 16mm available up to at least 200mm, but really, the 28-100mm on the RX is great.
9.0|#|Excellent manual control and raw file format.|#|Would prefer smoother zoom ring
10.0|#|A well made camera.  What sold it for me was the quick responding shutter button.|#|Easy to lose a grip of the camera
8.0|#|f1.8 lens|#|f4.9 at full zoom
9.0|#|Brilliant images for a very small camera - just what I wanted. Size is exactly right. Flexible Fn button is very clever. Images download easily.  Supporting software seems easy to use though the updating system is cranky.|#|On zoom the image crumbles at the corners (my Olympus bridge was far better) . The manual could be improved. I find I have to feel carefully for the on/off and shutter buttons - they are almost too flush with the top surface. The only time I have used the viewing screen in bright sunlight I had to adjust it manually in order to see the image.
9.0|#|superb LCD screen|#|none realy, the flash is a little vunerable: it pops up. But if it was built ito the body the lense would cause a shadow.
9.0|#|Very good results using automatic settings, for both raw and JPEG images. Relatively easy to use compared to other compacts and there are plenty of manual settings available for those who want them.|#|The high price however, I wanted a high quality digital compact camera with high MP, so I was prepared to pay above average price.
9.0|#|Excellent picture quality. Good in low light. Compact. Great for panoramas.|#|A little slippery to hold.
9.0|#|Very easy to use, very compact, excellent pictures|#|None
9.0|#|Fantastic 'pocket' camera.   Goes everyone with me, particularly when my A65 is just a bit too large.   Image quality is great, the Carl Zeiss lens is fantastic.  Access to a standard mode dial is a must for regular D-SLT users.  I love the fact that it can charge from a laptop USB port - this is another feature that makes it perfect when your'e travelling.  Overall I've been thoroughly delighted with this camera.|#|I've found the flash to be a little harsh.  The ability to angle it and bounce the light off of another surface is good but I'd like to see improvements in how the flash works generally.
8.0|#||#|No texte for aid. You must be an expert to use it.

8.0|#|Sensor size, image quality, slim pocketable size.|#|No viewfinder, no clicks when changing apertures on front lens ring.
9.0|#|Fits in my pocket and keep on me every day. Image quality amazing for a camera in this price range.|#|Manual focus ring needs a firmware upgrade to make it better for fine adjustment as needs too many turns to get to focus point which is awkward for such a small camera where you need it to be jus a slight turn to gain focus so you don't move the camera around too much.

9.0|#|Very portable|#|Rather slippery to hold.
9.0|#|Image quality, small size, features, solid feel|#|A pivoting imaging screen would improve the use, as , without a viewfinder, with the light behind the camera, viewing the subject can be difficult, regardless of Sony's claims for their new screen.
9.0|#|Same functionality as Sony DSLR|#|Nothing that wouldn't result in the body being bigger and thus not trouser pocketable - which is the whole point of this camera.

10.0|#|Excellent screen.|#|Can be a little 'slippy' in the hand....have accidentally dropped it due to not having as good a grip as I thought. (No damage caused due to being well made)
9.0|#|It's good to have a compact camera that produces such a good image.|#|At this time I can't think of any, except it would have been nice to be able to charge the battery outside the camera so that one could more easily use a spare battery.
9.0|#|Great in low light. Fantastic picture quality from pocket camera. I bought it for the potential manual control, but the Intelligent Auto is so good......|#|Easy to accidentally press video button. Easy to obstruct flash popping up. Not the easiest to hold, but much improved by Richard Franiec grip. Fairto say that these gripes are a result of its pocketability. You can't have your cake and eat it!

9.0|#|Very good image quality and features for such a compact camera|#|Ring controls not fully thought out e.g. duplication of function in some instances. In scn mode access to scene selection could be more usefully via control ring instead of through menu.
8.0|#|portability- easily fits in a handbag, good results in poor light, excellent landscapes, useful SCN setting.|#|Lack of manual. It took me three weeks to work out how to get into the BULB setting that the in-camera advice recommends for some firework photos.The features I am sure are good, it is just learning how to get to them which is tiresome.

I did it the hard way and downloaded and printed the manual - things got easier after that!

2.0|#|Lightweight.  Good quality images (when it actually captures them).  Very good focal length.|#|Extremely complicated to use (compared with a DSLR), not helped by the fact that no manual is available.  (The in-camera guide is little use, because as you follow its instructions and change a setting on the camera, the guide disappears, so you don't know the next step!)  The camera is very slow at capturing an image - taking up to 5 or 6 seconds before you can take the next picture.  It often won't focus and panoramic mode frequently doesn't work.  Battery sometimes only lasts for a few shots, even when fully charged.  When I returned to the shop to discuss the problems, I was told there was nothing wrong with it, I was expecting too much from a bridge camera!

So although she was very pleased with it she was unable to use it until we were able to buy a memory card for it, she was devastated as she had wanted to take pictures of the family xmas.

10.0|#|Focusing system is fast and accurate|#|The extra autofocus assistance points that give the tracking focus the edge only work with a handful of lenses.  Most importantly, wildlife photographers will need to upgrade to the Mark II version of the Sony 300mm f2.8 at a whopping £7,000 to take advantage of this.

8.0|#|I love the ergonomic layout, ease of use and video features. The A99 offers good mix of professional features and easy 'quick snap' features making it both ideal for my creative requirements as well as the whole family to pick up and use. Electronic view finder is great, especially when changing settings and shooting video (i am long sighted and this saves me having to hold the camera some distance away to make changes, review photos and do video) probably a market niche that has not been exploited for similar users who wear reading glasses. Presets are very useful and customised buttons and silent controller is excellent.|#|Lens choice is limited especially if you want to make use of 3d focus. That said, I have two of the Carl Zeiss 3d compatible lenses but am not convinced this system is as good or better at focusing than my previous Nikon. Biggest issue is that Sony make a big point about build quality, dust and moisture proofing of the A99, I am therefore really dissapointed that the top of the range Carl Zeiss lenses are not weather sealed?

9.0|#|Excellent update from the NEX5 which I have also owned. Love the built in EVF, as the 'add on' version for the NEX 5 meant you could not use the flash at the same time. Good size LCD and clear image in the EVF and on the display. Easy to use controls in any setting. Nice addition of the new function dial and top control wheel. In manual, settings for aperture and shutter are now simple. Mostly good menu system. Easy to clean sensor and lens changing is a breeze. Nicely designed body that is not much larger than the NEX5 but enough to make it more comfy in the hand. Good inbuilt flash with a useful range. A hotshoe for external flash rounds it off well. Easy to carry camera that has just undertaken two months service in every condition you can imagine in Brazil and not missed a beat! Battery life is excellent. Image quality is great for the sensor size and low light ability hand held is stunning even at ISO up to 1600. Overall a fantastic camera with very few things to add to the negative box :) I own a Nikon D800E and trust me, this little Sony NEX6 has as much use as the Nikon. It's an amazing travel camera and perfect to slip in your pocket with the pancake 16mm on it. I also use it with the 18-200mm.|#|Not many - Menus could do with a little work from actual 'out in real life' photographers and not Sony Engineers that like photography - can be a little fussy some times with item grouping being a little confused but overall ok. Pop up flash worked faultlessly BUT the mechanism is quite fragile and a bump will possibly kill it? more of a 'be aware' than a negative. Memory card location is a little hard to use for someone with large fingers (not all photographers are small Mr Sony!) but again - the system works without a fault - just a little tight to get to next to the battery door. As with the NEX 5 the LCD is hard to see in any sort of bright light, and I find the EVF to be a little small. Any chance of a larger EVF MR Sony? :) Overall a fantastic camera - not really any faults or complaints.

10.0|#|The Nex 6 is a superby built, quality camera with a intuitive controls and and astonishing range of features in a pocket-sized box. It has a good sensor size The APS-C sensor gets you much closer to the feeling of a 35mm SLR than almost all other compact camera systems, the built-in viewfinder is sensibly positioned and helps with framing in difficult conditions and the integrated flash is another useful bonus.|#|In the ideal world, the LCD screen would be both touch-sensitive and fully articulated (as it is, you can flip it up and down - which is great - but not round the front for self shooting). The flash is a bit of a blunt instrument and it's a nuisance going through menus to select manual focus - although there's a programmable fn button which allows you to fix this. But I think this is the best specced camera at its price.
8.0|#|This is a serious, well built and well thought-out camera that doesn't put obstacles in the way of creative photo taking.|#|Auto-focus is constantly working when the camera is on, which can be a problem when focussing then re-framing (although it can be locked by holding down the shutter button), and again drains battery charge.

The optional flash is a bit of a pain at times but the night time settings rule out the need for a flash. Taking 7 shots and compiling them to give one image is fantatsic. The panoramic shots are also a great facility. Switching lenses is simple too. Vidoe footage is great and easy to activate but will be good when the format is more usable.|#|Ok the battery life is a pain. I've spoken to Sony about this as I've found that my battery may have 90% when it is put away at the end of a night and then when I next use it the following day it may have reduced to 40%. One time it went from 83% to 0% and could not be switched on after being left for three days. Sony said that all rechargable batteries will lose charge over time but it is funny how this only happens when the battery is left in the camera. They said I could send it to be looked at by one of their service team but ifd nothing was found to be wrong with it I would have to pay the service charge. Looking into the issue this does seem to be common and what I think is happening is that teh internal battery (which keeps the time and date) is removing the charge from the main battery. So what I do is remove the battery when I'm not using the camera and this prolongs the battery no end. Bit of a pain but works well and it is something I'm happy to live with for this great camera. Cost is high but worth it and looking forward to the new telephoto lens to become available. Tilting screen is good but feels like it could be a weak link.

8.0|#|The NEX 5 takes point and shoot photography to another level. Great for the keen amateur photographer. It is easy to use and feels great to handle.|#|The manual photography is very basic, and not easy to use. If you want control of ISO setting and F stop settings like a traditional DSLR, then the NEX is not for you. Its all there, its just a bit 'fiddly'. The sony way of describing features is also a little strange, but once you get used to it, then its fine.
9.0|#|Fantastic image quality, superb build and extremely easy for beginners to use yet offering experienced photographers a multitude of manual options.|#|The lens covers are easy to lose.
9.0|#|Easy to use, lots of functions and good quality as you'd expect from Sony.|#|Sweep Panorama isn't always a good picture, some images can see the 'joining'.
10.0|#|The camera also boasts 1080p video recoprding and has a dedicated button so you don't have to go inton menus to start filming.  The quality is as you would expect with reasonable sound coverage via it's stereo mics (there is a dedicated mic attachment for enhanced sound coverage).|#|The accessories are expensive but not essential for people who are only going to use this other that their main source of income.
9.0|#|Overall, it's a camera that's as easy to use as a compact, but with all the advanced features of an SLR.|#|3) There are very few lenses for sale with the camera, instead needing a connector to use other SLR lenses.
10.0|#|Fantastic looking camera, good grip. True black screen fantastic quality, easy to use interface. Great images, panoramic setting excellent.|#|
9.0|#|I recently went up to the Isle of Skye and after the first day my a900 stayed in the room while my NEX came out hiking - I could even use it with ski gloves on.  I thoroughly recommend it.|#|Also I am not a fan of the 16mm lens in the kit although at the price I can't complain, I normally spend more on a lens than I did on this whole system!
8.0|#|Compact size with prime lens. (I can squeeze camera, both lenses, spare battery,selection of SD cards cleaning cloth etc in a very small and compact lowepro edit 110 bag).  Capability to shoot in raw format (compatible with lightroom). APS C sized sensor means great low light performance right up to 3200iso (better than my older nikon DSLR!). Can configure buttons to functionality that suits your shooting (though it is some what limited). Panoramic mode works well, quality perhaps not great for printing in my limited experience but views very well on 42 inch LED TV. Build quality seems good, feels good in the hand. Provides some hand holding advice for improving your photo's (this can easily be turned off if not required). Good quality screen (900k) which is moveable, great for low level shooting. Shoots full 1080p HD video in a selection of fast frame rates with stereo sound. A seperate mic attachment is available to improve sound should you require. Not used HD video much so limited experience on this area. But generally i believe HD video of this exceeds most if not all DSLR's.|#|OVERALL - This camera provides DSLR quality pics (it does use an APS C sized sensor) in a size that can be taken where you perhaps would not take your DSLR. A reasonable kit can be taken on holiday at a fraction of the size and weight of a comparable DSLR set up.
9.0|#|Good range of adapters to fit old manual lenses|#|Shame they couldn't get IS in the body
9.0|#|Movable viewing screen is a great asset.|#|Non-availability of all accessories ie dedicated long lens case, 200mm lenses to name two.
9.0|#|Great image quality with either kit lens - fantastic image quality with 3rd party lens and adapter|#|Happy with camera as a whole.  Any gripes with the user menu system will be fully rectified with firmware 3 that is arrivingin Mid-October
10.0|#|Well built easy to use, nice and compact|#|Would like to have the 55-200 mm which appears to be not available
9.0|#|+ The liveview design ethos makes for a camera that is an excellent learning tool.  You can see the effect of settings changes in real-time, e.g. aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Makes it a fun tool to use too!|#|.  If you embrace it then it's quite nice but the 18-55mm is an excellent kit lens and should be the default choice.

9.0|#|still plenty to explore|#|Nil
10.0|#|I bought this Sony NEX-5AS as an upgrade. I have only the fixed focus 2.8/18mm lens. I bought four extra batteries, several Class 10 SD cards from 16 to 4Gb, and a Jessops carry case. I am a lifelong amateur with special interests in outdoor photography. I have taken about 10,000 photos in several countries so far. It satisfies all my parameters. It is eminently portable, and is discreetly good looking, and rugged. Its on board programmes offer intelligent solutions, are extremely versatile, and you can add customised ones. It gives me excellent full manual control, and I am still discovering new combinations of features. I find the menus are quick, easy to access, and comprehensive. I am a big fan of the PMB software for managing my photos on PC.|#|
9.0|#|ISO rating up to 12800 allows shots in virtual darkness|#|Takes a little getting used to the menus, and the adapter fitting feels a little limiting for flashes etc.
9.0|#|Small! Very fast, except for start-up time. Ideal to put 3rd party lenses on such as voigtländer and Leica for a compact, high quality manual focus unit.|#|More enhancements than dislikes really...
9.0|#|Excellent features excellent image quality|#|Menus awful - think again sony
7.0|#|Takes excellent pictures|#|Too easy to leave camera switched on, battery ife only sufficient for one day of busy use. Poor visibility of screen especially in bright sunlight. Not easy to carry around, strap supplied is not very suitable.
10.0|#|Compact camera body with SLR results - incredible camera, a great introductory step from point and shoot to SLR. The auto-function to get that SLR favourite shot of super in focus person in foreground with blurry background is outstanding.|#|Quite expensive, but the pictures are worth it!
10.0|#|Everything ! This camera miust be the very best currently on the market. I thought so when I was comparing cameras before my purchase. Now I have had time to really discover it during a recent holiday, I am even more convinced. Its compact, lightweight, easy to change lenses, easy to carry and easy to use. The quality of the build and the image quality is just excellent !!|#|Expensive !
9.0|#|I have upgraded from a point and shoot camera and all i can really say is WOW, the difference is amazing ok its a little bit awkward fitting the flash, but its not needed too much. I had read a lot of reviews about the battery life all i say to that is get real i have just come back from a two day break in Marrakech and took about 85 pictures(about 15 using flash) and still had 52% power left, so no problems for the average user.|#|None really except when are ALL manufacturers going to include the basics like an SD card/case, i suppose its just another profit opportunity.
6.0|#|Packs a lot into a small body|#|18 - 55 mm lens does not provide the zoom I was looking for, necessitating the purchase on a new, expensive lens. Looking at the histogram there is constantly a nasty spike in the colours. Not keen on the UI navigation.
9.0|#|Easy to use. Light weight Great functionality. Easy to adjust settings e.g. shutter speed, ISO settings etc..  Great pre-sets e.g. macro and portrait setting.  Brilliant for intermediate photographers.|#|Limited lens availability. Viewfinder screen is limited to up and down.
10.0|#|Easy to use, with brilliant. Professional quality images!|#|Maybe a little expensive
9.0|#|Flexible usability level, excellent image quality.|#|Not found one yet.
7.0|#|It takes great pictures and has some cool features such as the panorama function. Low light-level pictures are brilliant. The small size is excellent and I often think of it as a compact, forgetting that in terms of quality I'm getting something closer to an SLR.|#|Battery life is quite limited, though given the features and the big LCD screen that's unsurprising I suppose. The lens shutter jammed after less than a  month and I had to return it for a replacement. Accessing some features can be a bit laborious via the onscreen menu -- this is a bit annoying given that one of the few buttons on the outside is just for accessing photo tips. I would have liked it if I could have reprogrammed that to do something more useful e.g. access ISO settings.

9.0|#|Very small with pancake lens, super quick auto focus, good flexibility so can be used day to day and take semi-professional photos. Body is well finished and feels solid, flash works very well with respect to flash compensation etc. Features are plentiful and well developed.|#|Expected images to be a little sharper, 18-55 lens feels a bit cheap and doesn't move as smoothly as it could. Menu can be tedious, low light images become grainy. Attaching flash is fiddley but once on is fine.
10.0|#|small and easy to carry, very high image quality. HDRis good as is the Dynamic Range. Over all a great little camera|#|not being able to use HDR with remote or self timer when on tripod,but that is only minor, cant think of any other bad points
9.0|#|This camera has improved my photography skills as I learn more and progress from automatic to the manual settings. I am currently using the aperture priority setting with fantistic results and have the soft button set for ISO settings.|#|Touch screen focus would make using manual options easier.

7.0|#|easy to use, robust build, compact size, wide angle lens, menu, video,|#|lacks view finder. this is the biggest weakness with it and on a few occasions i have found the lack of one frustrating and hard to understand why it does not have one. of course i knew it did not have one when i bought it , but liked it in every other respect, but when taking pictures with the sun behind me (which is normally the case) even tilting the screen does not allow for a clear viewing of the image. i have considered buying the very expensive optical view finder, but see little point as this only works with the wide angle lens not the zoom
10.0|#|The Nex 5 is for artists / designers  - a must have for anyone in design aesthetics industry|#|Reasonable price / Good quality eyepiece for occasional use needed.
8.0|#|Very good image quality and build. The 18-200 lens is excellent.|#|Expensive, but there again you get what you pay for.
9.0|#|Light and much easier to carry around than a digital SLR, very easy to use and the large screen makes it easy to navigate through the functions. I love the retro look of the camera and it's turned a couple of head, which is always good. I particular love the 3D panoramic function which has produced some stunning shots, viewable on a 3D tv.|#|The flash is sometimes fiddly to attach and the lenses are silver when the camera body is black, sony should definately consider lenses or accessories to match the camera body colour
9.0|#|4. HD movie is very good quality|#|2. 50p movie mode would be nicer vs the 50i AVCHD it records in
9.0|#|Compact, ease of use with tips on each of the functions, great for learning. Intelligent auto. Interchangeable lenses great to be able to use as compact or a lifestyle camera. Battery life. Panoramic. Antimotion blur setting very useful. Great combination of better quality shots with compact simple features of a point a shoot|#|The cost of the lenses especially the zoom. No built in flash. Cost of cases and official accessories.
7.0|#||#|function was not anywhere near as good as the Canon G12.
10.0|#|A great 'convenience' camera for experienced photographers. Sturdy build|#|Case too expensive
10.0|#|Great in low light, never need to use the flash! Feels just like a compact, easy to hold and to handle. Even with the 18-55 lens it isn't bulky. The scroll wheel makes it very easy to navigate the screen, and the screen tilt comes in really useful. With the 16mm attached it's easy to carry around.|#|Will have to buy the attachment if I want to be able to use A mounts. Perhaps a little pricey compared to other DSLR's but the size of it makes up for that. Easy to carry around with the 16mm but lacks zoom - so if you want to be able to use it you need to use the 18-55 which isn't that much of a problem. Overall the good points outweigh the bad for me, definitely glad to have purchased!

9.0|#|Great picture quality, solid feel and as expected excellent build quality from this manufacturer.  A well thought out option between a pocket sized point and shoot and a DSLR.  A good back up camera for the professional and an excellent option for people who don't want to lug around a filthy great camera bag full of equipment.  Glass quality is high and options and features are plentiful.|#|Expensive and a little fiddly at times also, the flash is not great for anything more than close portraits, but the image quality and overall package has far more pro's than con's

7.0|#|The NEX 5 is built really well. You can customize the buttons to suit you which helps overcome some of the shortcomings of the fiddly and non intuitive menu structure making it quicker to use. Great quality in low light. Good video quality. Simple to overcome the very poor supplied lenses - a cheap adaptor off the web will enable you to get the full potential from the camera by using lenses from just about any manufacturer. Fantastic picture quality (if fitted with a decent lens), great colours, competes well with dslrs at much higher price|#|

10.0|#|When a small camera fits so comfortably into your hand it inspires more creative use. The wide flip up LCD makes it very versatile for ease of use. The active menu and demo mode features are much appreciated. HD Video is an amazing feature also. All the manual over-ride features and focussing have been professionally thought out. Another much respected product with the Sony badge!|#|Currently, March 2012, it is impossible to get the full range of lenses due to the backlog on production (due to the earthquake damage in Japan). Very frustrating! Would love therefore a better lens adapter and LCD viewfinder. Sadly the tiny flash head (supplied) is very fragile and I would have preferred a hot shoe.

9.0|#|A good sturdy camera, that looks great. The image quality is good, although some colours were not 100% in places, a dark blue dress came out as dark purple when using auto.

I rate this camera highly.|#|Some of the features are not as simple to use as my previous Panasonic, but that may be because I am used to the previous camera. I must try and get the manual out and read it!!!! One feature I am having difficulty with, which may be simple, but I have yet to master it is viewing the pictures taken.  It appears to be complicated to view them, but again it may be that I am not doing it correctly.

In my case normally seems to be that I use RAW mode and that disables HDR and some other modes.
9.0|#|Although I haven't made a great deal of use of he NEX-5DS yet, it is showing real promise as robust high-quality product. You can make it as easy as possible and just switch on the automatic aspect of optimal picture taking factors (which I've used mainly so far) or elect to change that manually to shutter speed or aperture for example. The interchangeable lenses are suitable for the job. The telephoto lens will be of great use when I go to a local air show for example and the 'pancake' 26mm lens is great for wide angle and group shots, useful for my work in website creation.|#|Could do with an optical viewfinder as the rear panel can be difficult to see in strong sunlight. Takes some getting used to all the facilities available - maybe that's not too much of a bad point!

8.0|#|Build and features as well as picture quality.|#|Price is a little high. Can't edit the images on the camera. Flash mode options a little restrictive.
8.0|#|I absolutely love the design and build of this camera and the image quality for a non-SLR is exceptional. However, now that I have lived with it for a while, I think the user interface is very flawed - it is designed for someone wanting a step up from compact but not wanting to jump in with DSLR. However, it has most of the features of a DSLR, so I think what the User Interface designers should have done, is made it easier to use the DSLR features (without having to drill through so many menus) to satisfy someone such as myself, who although initially wary of the advanced features, has now developed an interest in them. This I believe is inevitable with a camera of such quality as this. The argument that it would make it more daunting for novices I believe is moot - my experience is that novices simply put it in iAuto mode and just click away, as this still produces stunning pictures.|#|Poor user interface when trying to use some of the more advanced features. Seperate flash is a bit of a pain.

9.0|#|Good quality strong build,well above avarage photo quality and the HD video is fairly good too.The auto features seem to work well and having a manuial overide can be usefull.Light and compact so carring it arround is fairly easy compared to other cameras that can produce pictures of this quality.Have unfortunatly dropped it a few times but it isnt even scratched.|#|In strong sun light it is very hard to see the image you are trying to take a picture of,even with the brightness turned full up.Fast moving images in Hd video tend to stutter a little.When using the flash it tends to produce red eye easily but I am still learning to use the flash functions ,so it could be my use of it.The large lense is a little expensive but It can now take some other lenses if you buy the adaptor,but with some reduction in features or response times.Can feel a little strange to hold at first but I soon got used to it.

8.0|#|Compact and light, when compared to a DSLR, but with APS-C sensor which gives comparable images. Well built, raw capability, fun to use, neat features: sweep panarama, held held twilight etc.|#|External flash is fiddly to attach, even with my small hands.  Current choice of e-mount lenses.

10.0|#|Over all the bad points far out way the good and I absolutely love this camera!|#|I have not been able to get the movies off the camera as you need a program that can play an HD movie, so that is a bit annoying and I still havent sorted that out. I think it comes with software that should play it, but its jumpy and not the best when playing it back, (this could of course be down to other factors)
10.0|#|I love it my photos come out great|#|
9.0|#||#|Cant find any bad points.
9.0|#|Its very good being small and very easy to use  as a point and shoot camera.|#|It might be alright for point and shooters but if like me you wish to explore its features it can be annoying as it is difficult  to find most of them. Please change any future models to overcome this
7.0|#|the image quality is very good; the fold out screen allows optimum positioning of the camera for avoiding distortion particular in the verticals when using the widest angles.  the panorama feature is interesting; playback of images is realtively simple as is the video recording.|#|the menu driven screens are difficult to navigate around and the location of some features is either not logical or takes too much time and effort to get to.  would benefit from more feature deicated buttons rather than the current multifunction/option buttons.  the separate long focus zoom lens is more expensive than the camera (with a standard zoom AND 16mm wide angle).  makes the precticality of interchangeable lenses uneconomic and therefroe little more than a gimmick.
10.0|#|SIMPLICITY//QUALITY//it just works!|#|The zoom lens is 50 euros less than the whole camera kit?  you might want to rethink that one!

8.0|#|It is quite handy as the size is small. Does nto feel very intimidating.|#|Not having an optical view finder takes some getting used to. The 18-200 MM lens are priced beyond a normal person's reach. The menu has some features turned off for various settings. It will be helpful to have some explanation of which modes a particular feature will be available for use with. Without that explanation, it seems quite mysterious that some features are disabled.
8.0|#|The great thing about this camera is that you can adapt any type of lenses on it, provided you invest into adapter mounts. I have Nikkon and a Canon lenses I can put on the Nex5 and it works very well. The canon lens is an FD mount bought in the 80s!|#|

9.0|#|I really enjoy using this camera, the controls all seem to be in the right place and its quite instinctive to use them. I have big hands and its easy to use on the whole, although the menu control button can be a bit of a faff. The weight of the camera is enough to make it feel substantial and reduce camera shake, but yet still make it easy to take the camera when you are going out. With the pancake lens its small enough to put into a jacket pocket.|#|I'm very particular about image sharpness and this is not as sharp as a nikon lens on my old film camera. Maybe not a fair comparison though. I'd quite like to see if some of the other sony or minolta lenses are sharper.

9.0|#|I am a very keen amateur photographer and have used this camera to take a wide range of subject matter. It has amazing image quality and camera build. Screen is perfectly clear in all weather conditions. Very compact and comfortable to hold and not too heavy. Looks very sexy and causes a lot of envy with friends (the silver one is a must). With the pancake lens fitted will easily slide into your coat pocket. Intelligent auto is extremely good at judging the subject matter and there are plenty of options to fully customise your shots when in manual. Sweep Panorama is genius and low light images are outstanding with the twilight setting. Very good depth of field to give stunning blurred backgrounds and crystal clear foreground. Easy access to battery and SD card. Overall, a brilliant camera that is very adaptable and good value for money. Some good deals out there if you look hard enough.|#|There are only a few but they can be a little frustrating at times. Certain everyday settings such as ISO and White Balance are fiddly to find and adjust quickly. Very limited at the moment with the accessories available and prices are very high for official parts. Camera doesn't use a standard Hot Shoe so only one type of flash can be used limiting it's functions and finally the record button is easily pressed by accident. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this camera and can not believe the quality of images I am getting from such a compact system. Have looked very closely at other Compact System Camera's especially the Lumix G2 and in nearly all ways this is a better camera.
9.0|#|I like the features on the camera and that it it smaller than my DSLR but has the capabilities of changing lens. Better build quality than the  Lumix which why I went for this camera.|#|
9.0|#|I have been delighted with the camera so far and am looking forward to taking it on holiday in May. I bought the package with the pancake lense and have used it more than I anticipated. It is light and easy to handle - a great asset as I have slightly arthritic hands.|#|When changing lenses I would prefer a more contrasting colour eg red for the line up dot. I would like a built in flash.
10.0|#|Easy to use with built in demo instructions, gives you professional shots with minimum effort, sleek design, light weight and easy to handle.|#|
6.0|#|Small|#|Very expensive zoom lens
8.0|#|In 'idiot' mode, it generally takes really good pictures.|#|Finally, although the picture quality is great. The sound quality is poor. There's no controls to change the microphone sensitivity and on a number of occasions the sound has been heavily clipped. So much so, I've recorded back-up audio on an iPhone and merged it with the video track.

10.0|#|It is a very good and easy camera to use. It covers most peoples skill levels - from full auto for the point and clicker to full manual for the more advanced photographer, whilst giving excellent results to all.|#|The lens mount is E-fit, so the range of native lenses is small, and using the A-fit converter (expensive in itself), whilst giving a larger range of lenses, dose so at the expense of reduced speed performance in AF mode (AF mode with converter requires software upgrade  very easy to do).
10.0|#|The quality of photos and videos are wonderful and transfer for TV screening amazingly well in real HD. Getting a large size card has proved valuable as it provides literally hours of recording. We bought the camera two days before a month holiday in California so it was vital we could learn to use quickly.|#|We had not realised that we had to use Sony's own image processing software when transferring to PC. Sony is not compatible with other video formats which it makes it more difficult to combine with existing video libraries.

9.0|#|Amazing lens therefore amazing images. Was attracted to the 3D function to use on my Sony 3D T.V. but as yet have not found the images 3D-effective - maybe user error. The mini-HDMI connection sends images through to the T.V. quicker than via the USB connection - saves on battery life. Dual memory slot is great - I can use existing Micro SD card + adaptor. Can zoom in/during High Def movie. On-board thumb-size and calendar mode to view images is very useful; the supplied SONY software CD also allows same searching on a PC. Screen res is great. On-Screen Menu and trouble shoot functions are very handy for short cuts.|#|Good metal body but needs more rubberised grip points. The power button is in the way when holding the camera, the stereo mics are also in the way when taking movies - suggest using a mini-tripod whenever possible.

Back ground defocus mode is fun.  Inteligent mode and manual mode are very good.  Deals with strong back light well too.  It is small and light and looks good.  I have not tried the 3d modes.|#|There doesn't appear to be a way of turning the macro on perminantly.  Manual functions seem limited, i.e. not fully manual like an SLR.

For me this camera is a dream machine.  Probably best suited to a very enthusiastic person or a pro.  I am still getting to know it so my excitement will continue for some time yet.  It is expensive but, from my point of view worth every penny.  I have not had a problem with the selection of lenses for it, in fact I found the selection for me quite adequate, if I needed more choice of lens I would use a converter and purchase a canon lens,  but that's personal choice.|#|A touch screen would have been nice but not really needed, so not bad just a thought.

The 2-second setting isn't long enough for the tripod to settle down during night photography. 5 and 15-second settings would be better.

Should have spent £200+ and bought a slightly larger compact - this is a false economy.  Pictures OK when in focus, but really better off paying more.
8.0|#|Credible alternative to Coolpix S3300 and Canon Ixus 220hs, both of which died after 18-24 months with lens errors.|#|Refuses to take any picture at all when very little light.
10.0|#|I love that its purple, my favourite colour! Its a great size for carrying round with you. Plus it takes amazing clear pictures, I especially like the panarama feature. Features are great quality too.|#|The one thing is the battery, I took it out for the day and within 2 hours it had gone down by half.
10.0|#|Perfect to just point and shoot.|#|
5.0|#||#|Bought this camera for the Movie function, as it has a dedicated movie button, Sadly filming cuts after 12 min 46 sec and shuts off. sadly wasn't fit for my purposes, however company were more than helpful in returns.
7.0|#|Compact charger.|#|
8.0|#|Fast focusing, good in low light, nice high ISO performance. Much improved over the original A65/A77|#|A little heavy, focus point selection a bit difficult in low light. Lack of GPS
9.0|#|camera is excellent cant fault it|#|The manual is a waste of space poorly written and incomplete
9.0|#|3 user memories|#|Sony UK did not do free battery grip offer currently available in US.
10.0|#|Great camera for when I don't want to lug my Canon 5D MKII around. Fast focusing and great images.|#|No manual, you have to download so not so easy to go through the menus.
10.0|#|Much lighter to carry than an slr but features and quality of slr. Much more likely to take it with me when out and about due to weight. (Haven't tried out the 2nd lens yet. ) Love being able to load pics straight to my phone and email right away.|#|No help working out what all the settings are and how to access them. I had to find various web-sites that helped me work through them one by one. Still feel I have loads to learn. Doesn't come with an external charger -only charges via camera.
9.0|#|Overall I am extremely happy with the camera.|#|Possibly a little expensive and knowing I need to fork out on an external recorder for 4k is a shame however I don't think 4k is really necessary at this point in time however in a year or two when it is, the external recorders will no doubt be a lot cheaper so I'd say if the lack of internal 4k was giving you doubts not to worry to much about it. The other features of this camera will be much more appealing than 4K definition to the eyes of the average video watcher.
8.0|#|Excellent zoom really impressive especially clear pictures of the Moon.|#|No flash hot shoe.
8.0|#|Easy to handle and very light in weight|#|Had to buy a new lens cover as the original had no string so it could be  attached to the camera
10.0|#|Looks|#|Heavy around your neck

9.0|#|Excellent image quality, seems robust. Configurability is good.|#|Poor battery life. Battery charger should be supplied for this money. Documentation dreadful.
9.0|#|Excellent allround camera. Produces sharp still pictures and movies (the later with surprisingly good sound quality). Robust build and a great camera to take out on the water (in conjunction with a float wrist strap, as camera doesn't float)! Touch screen really easy to use and no need for the supplied stylus.|#|In-camera retouching gimmicky and largely pointless (feature can of course be ignored).
6.0|#|Small and easy to use, good as a point and shoot camera|#|Had to be replaced as let in water, noise reduction makes poor light images unuseable
1.0|#|small size, waterproof|#|
1.0|#|Before the camera stopped working the photos were amazing!|#|As you Can imagine this caused us lots of stress and we had to buy a camera to get us by, that alone cost £100 and took poor photos in comparison.
9.0|#|Easy to use, great camera if you just want to point and shoot. Waterproof, shockproof and dustproof. Movie quality is excellent includin the ability to zoom while filming.|#|Not enough manual settings is a massive drawback. The touchscreen is hard to use at first.
2.0|#|The concept of this tough little camera is fantastic|#|Its way over sold, I dropped mine once from 1 foot high it cracked on the top right hand corner and broke, after googling reviews this seems like a really common fault.  The most undurable durable camera.
9.0|#|light. quick metering and shutter action. good  built in editing.|#|could do with a bit more zoom
9.0|#|Ideal for pocket photographers|#|
9.0|#|Amazing camera, very good for close up shots. Some stunning scenery pictures, and brilliant face recognition. Also fabulous under water quality photos.|#|pictures can be blurred, so needs a steady hand, unless on the handheld setting.
7.0|#|Image quality|#|Start up time to slow
10.0|#|- it really is waterproof, took it snorkeling and it still works|#|- takes time and use of help guide to find your way around menus
9.0|#|Durable, very easy to use. Water proof.|#|The sliding cover, although useful gets debris trapped under it far too easily. It would be useful if this could removed with a clip, or switch to allow debris to be removed without first scratching the camera itself. The screen at the rear of the camera gets easily marked - within hours; it would ahve been a nice touch to add a screen cover and to advise that new ones be purchased for future use. Or use something more durable. My phone screen is two years old, without a mark on it!
6.0|#|Full HD movie|#|
9.0|#||#|touch screen poor
10.0|#|Very small, touch screen good response time.. almost as good as an iphone.. could get on the way sometimes.. good pic quality over and underwater.. value for money.. a good camera case cause £200+ without the good camera.. very happy with it..|#|can't really see the screen on sunny days..
8.0|#|Excellent pics. Good colour - vivid but natural. Intelligent mode really works well to maintain a good picture. Good variety of formats / definitions including a very clever panorama which seems magically to maintain a horizon and cope with varying sweep speed. And has HD Video too.|#|A single grain of sand or dirt can get behind the lens cover causing a scratch when opening the cover. Touch screen doesn't always register - sometimes need 2 or 3 touches for a button to respond.
7.0|#||#|I will be sending it back for repair as the back of the camera has two cracks on the body
9.0|#|Lots of features, especially for it's size. Being robust (eg quite waterproof) is important to me.|#|it would be great if a photoframe was available for mpo images.
9.0|#|Very handy size and a very smart camera|#|Easy to touch screen by mistake and change a status.
9.0|#|Great in auto mode, also burst and panorama are stunning, its very small and fits in a pocket with ease, as it's water and dust proof this makes a great hoilday by the pool or on the beach camera|#|Not realy bad points, the camera is only realy for limited range photos as it only has a 4x zoom lens and is not compatable with the partyshot dock, but to be fair this is the price you pay for waterproof and pocket/handbag friendly camera, i would say a great second camera
10.0|#|There are such great features which will enable your photos to be the greatest of quality!|#|If you bring it to the beach and sand gets in it, it scratches off things.
9.0|#|hadling|#|too complicated menu but a Retractable Zoom lense would make it perfect!
9.0|#|Picture Quality, features, looks|#|Easy to scratch, touch screen can be fiddly.
9.0|#|Great images in daylight.|#|Not so good in low light, difficult to download film clips off camera to computer
9.0|#||#|- Sound could be improved on video recordings
8.0|#|Panoramic images are fantastic. Screen is very large which benefits quick views. Build quality is very comforting, product feels very high in quality.|#|OS is very very slow and can be annoying when trying to capture within quick time. This was a major issue when comparing to the TX5 which I previously owned and was very fast to switch on and operate.
9.0|#|Panorama function superb. Intellgent auto is awesome too. Image quality superb|#|Pull down front cover feels slightly flimsy. Chews battery a little faster than other similar cameras but not shockingly so. Touch screen a little fickle at times
8.0|#|Very easy to use, looks lovely|#|A 'faff' to find the right setting. When out clubbing the intelligent auto serting doesn't cut it and the images are blurry and I'm yet to find the right setting
8.0|#|Small good image quality|#|Slow to respond
8.0|#|Small and light.|#|Front cover hard to open.  Touch arrow to view pictures takes many goes before it works. Not happy with this product.
10.0|#|Nicely balanced camera which makes it easy to use in any circumstance.|#|
8.0|#|Straightforward screen info to follow.|#|Unable to chnage the time of exposures. I brought it especially to take photos of the Northern Lights, but was unable to do so on any of the settings.
8.0|#|Small, robust and great images|#|Would have liked a manual.  Annoying messages to close the panels when already closed.
9.0|#|Great looking camera with impressive build quality and compact size. Very good video recording and excellent sound reproduction. Easy to use menu and features make this a great camera to own.|#|Very poor battery life, will need spare. Touch screen too unresponsive compared to other products and this gets frustrating. Focus lag can sometimes result in blurred video.
7.0|#|Easy for taking photos quickly. Good size or small hands. Unobtrusive. Easy to move through options using touch.|#|A bit fiddly o move through the menu options.No pouch to hold camera.
8.0|#|Search menu and ordinary menu absolutely brilliant and very easy to use. Sound in video mode very good!|#|Battery life could be improved as could zoom options and zoom.
8.0|#|So many features in such a compact size. Versatile, good in low light. Good quality pictures and HD video.|#|Touch display is a bit hit 'n miss, making operation cumbersome. Difficult to use in the water. Sensor is too small to live up to one's expectation from 16M pixel camera, as fine detail such as grass merges becomes indistinct.
9.0|#|Size and lens does not protrude.|#|Screen scratches too easily.
5.0|#|size, waterproof|#|no viewfinder, small zoom, no aperture or shutter priority
8.0|#|It worked well for a while|#|it broke really quickly

8.0|#|Quick and easy|#|Light rings on some photographs, similiar to previous camera. Very annoying
1.0|#|pictures quality|#|NOT WATERPROOF !!!!!!! I bought this camera in the international airport Incheon in south Korea during vacation. I use it one week doing snorkeling in Venezuela. I use it in 1 to 1.5 meter deep maximum. The HDMI port is totally oxided and there is water inside the objective. I really take care of it, checking there is no sand and so on.... I am desapointed and angry because I bought it just for this special use !!! I came back in my country and faced trouble with the garantee because I bought it outside of the europe!!!!! I wait far better from such a big INTERNATIONAL company !!!!!
10.0|#|Overall a very good camera.|#|Non
8.0|#|Picture quality excellent.|#|The touch-screen is a little difficult to understand and takes some getting used to.
7.0|#|Panoramic is amazing|#|No actual charger to charge battery on its own; have to plug in camera to charge battery. Also no HDMI cable provided in my box.
9.0|#|Lovely camera robust waterproof yet looks good and takes great pictures. Easy to handle on a night out.|#|Touch screen is slightly off so when trying to click on precise buttons you don't always seem to get them and there doesn't seem to be a recalibration screen to adjust it.
5.0|#|Very small and sleek, can be carried around in your proket or purse. Very good quality pictures.|#|Hate the touch screen, switches on at the slightest touch, even when it's supposed to be off. Highly sensitive to touch... keeps opening up features at the slightest touch and often one needs to ensure that the fingers don't accidently touch the screen because it opens up all kinds of applications. There is no manual to help with the selection of features of available. One just has to learn by trial and error or not use it at all. Didn't think the pictures taken with the night mode was all that clear.
9.0|#|Excellent underwater performance.  Overall image and movie quality absolutely fantastic for such a small camera, superb Zeiss lens.  Brilliant panoramic images produced. Its like having a computer inside your camera.|#|The front sliding cover on the camera owned by me is a little stiff.  Also the touch screen can be sometimes be a little unresponsive.
10.0|#|Superb quality. Robust build. Easy to use, but can be complex - but that's part of the fun of learning to use a camera like this. Performs well under water and is compact as to almost be unreal. 16.2 mega pixels is a massively detailed shot. Good video features up to 1080. Great burst speeds too.|#|Screen lighting on a bright day could do with being improved.
9.0|#||#|Unable to upload videos to computer.
9.0|#|I buy a new camera every year and this has been the best so far.|#|Touch screen a bit fiddly and has sensitivity issues on occasions.
9.0|#|Small enough to take with you anywhere and good  image quality. AVCHD movies look better than my dedicated cam corder although it doesn't have as good a zoom. I probably won't try it underwater til next summer, but I have every confidence it'll be good for snorkelling|#|Just a little slow when starting to record movies, but then again it isn't a dedicated cam corder. Its quick enough for stills
8.0|#|Well featured easy to use compact camera|#|waterproofing looks 'dodgy' unwilling to risk it at the moment, design encourages your left hand to cover the lens
8.0|#|iSweep panorama function is great and the user interface is really good.|#|The TX10 is meant to be shock proof up to 1.5m but dropping it from just under 1m height the casing cracked and broke off which makes me concerned it is no longer water proof.
10.0|#|Everything|#|nothing
8.0|#||#|Very hard to hold the camera to take a shot without getting a finger over the lens.
8.0|#|the overall package is good with a range of advanced imaging modes which offer more control than most simple consumer cameras. The background defocus mode is excellent. THe CEMOS chip is excellent in low light conditions.|#|the panoramic feature is poor with unsatisfactory results.  The user interface is a little slow for switching modes.
9.0|#|Its simply the best feature packed compact camera I have ever come across.|#|Night time pictures taken with flash have some sometimes have white spots caused by light reflecting on a dust particle or even a tiny drop of water close to the lens. This is inherent problem with all compact digital cameras. So can't blame sony.
8.0|#|Slips easily into a shirt pocket, instantly ready. Easy to use, touch screen works well|#|The lense is close to a corner of the camera so you have to ensure every time that you are not obstructing the photo with the edge of a finger ofthe hang holding the camera. Not a major problem but easily done if you forget
8.0|#|Very compact and robust.|#|Awkward and difficult to navigate menu system.
9.0|#|Good quality photos.  Smart mode means I can take photos quickly and the camera adapts to the situation and takes the best photo possible. Love the camera and had some fantastic photos from it.|#|Very short battery life. If you are going to take quite a few photos eg. a wedding or as I did my D of E expedition it does not last more than a day. Can be a bit tricky to change the settings for manual mode or special effect mode. What I miss most  is the fact I cannot take Black and White photos but did not find out until after I bought the camra.
6.0|#|This camera takes a really brilliant photograph. I bought this for a foreign holiday and was so pleased with the clear and crispness of the photos.|#|After using for one holiday and having to remove the battery once for re-charging, the 'door' underneath the camera which opens to reveal both the battery compartment and the SD card storage, broke! Seriously unimpressed with this! The lock mechanism that keeps the door shut had snapped and therefore the camera wouldn't stay closed. We returned it to the shop where it was purchased, and they told us they had received a few of these cameras back with the same fault. It has now been fixed as is now working again, but for how long! Believe me, I am extremely careful and it just snapped! Not impressive at all!
8.0|#|light, fun to use,good quality|#|the button that you press to take photoes is not definate enough.  I take photoes, look for them and then realise the button was not pressed down enough because the camera has an up-turned ridge just were the button is which interfers.

8.0|#|Excellent,Crisp Photos, Good HD 720P Filming,Easy Features to use. Will definitely recommend this camera :)|#|
9.0|#|Size for pocket - image quality -  Panoramic features are very easy to use - 16meg image can be cropped with ease and still has quality finish. Video  is very good. Ideal to have with you all the time just like having a small phone in your pocket.|#|Not to bad but does use battery up  at a reasonable pace, cant charge straight from camera you have to remove battery and charge in charging unit.
8.0|#|very nice and light design. The pictures have really nice and natural colours. It has the smile auto capture, which really works good. They offer image recovery from the sd card.|#|It costs over 30% more compared to other brands with same specs. If a spare battery or a an 8Gb card instead of 4Gb was supplied with the camera it would be more value for money.
9.0|#|nice design (body material and size), good image quality when compared to other devices on similar price, build in memory with software,|#|sometimes problems with setting focus on objects (especially in video mode). no HDMI output, No USB charging, low quality of battery lid (it is very fragile and could be easy damaged)
10.0|#|Excellent pocket camera if you don't want to carry a heavier bridge camera and only need 5x zoom..Very good close up definition on flowers etc.|#|The button to take the pictures is not as positive as I would like...it is too slippery!

This little item comes very close to that, even though you can always change your mind as to what is set later. Haven't yet stuck the onboard s/w on my lappy yet so cannot comment on it at the moment. Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera.|#|None found so far!

7.0|#|Multiple scene settings.|#|option - so if you want to have 6 by 4 photos you need to crop the photos (which often means losing part of the image you thought was in the shot). Image sizes available are 4 by 3 and 16 by 9.

9.0|#|Easy to use straight out of the box, plenty of gadgets but all with auto settings so it's practically idiot-proof. Lots of cool stuff included for a reasonable price, especially the panorama feature. The switch on the side to choose photo/video/panorama is a brainwave, so easy to use. Very slim and light camera, and nice-looking.|#|A little fiddly to find the settings and instructions if you want to change off the auto modes. Not much zoom, and the image quality is good rather than great, especially on the panoramic shots. And the off switch doesn't always work first time you press it.

9.0|#|I am a bit of a techno phobe despite having a computer and sky etc. Eventually I find my way around these items and learn how to use them to the point of being able to teach my wife how to use the camera. All in all a good product and perfectly suitable for someone who can neither afford a lot of money or indeed want to.|#|
9.0|#|Its easy and straight forward to use, it's great for simple photo shots, nights out and holiday photos. I took it on holiday and it was so compact and handy. You can resixe and edit photos to some extent|#|The volume is very low, when you record something it concentrates more on backgorund noise than anything else, unless you are in a relatively quiet place.
10.0|#|Great Image Quality; SD Card instead of Son y Memory Card; Battery have a great time of duration; Can  adjust the EVO, Brighteness.|#|A little bit large, just 4x Zoon; When you are seeing the pictures is a little bit slow, could be faster.
8.0|#|simple automatic function - no need to select set-up types on a selection wheel, thereby avoiding settings being inadvertently changed when quickly grabbing the camera to take shots. This was bought as  replacement for a previous Sony (W210), which was stolen on holiday, and is used by my partner, who is basically a point and shoot photographer, so the additional functions of the previous model were not really used - this is very simple to use.|#|build quality is a bit plasticky - this was bought as a replacement for a previous Sony (W210) and that had a much more solid construction, with an all metal body. However, it is very light as a consequence and easy to carry and have available on nights out etc. One omission compared to the previous model is a viewfinder - my partner likes to look through a viewfinder rather than compose on the screen (a bit old fashioned, I know, but that's what she likes!!) and this model ojmits that feature which the W210 had.
10.0|#|very easy to use for 1st time digital camera user. good battery life.|#|on/off button can be switched on easily if in a pocket or handbag. would recommend a hard carry case

8.0|#|The product is very small, fits in my bag and pocket, the battery lasts a lot and it's fully automatic. It recognises faces, too much sun, dark, etc and adjustices itself. Not much manual work to be done and the quality is excellent.|#|There are not bad points just a bit of disappointment as there are not some features I took for granted. Having owned a Sony previously I was expecting to have the ability to apply filters, for example seppia,  black and white, etc. The manual is very basic, I guess there is more help online.
9.0|#|As a novice camera user I found this very easy to use. At 1st viewing the pictures on the camera screen i was worried they looked poor qaulity but on downloading them they were excellent. The Battery life is excellent and the compact size means I can pop it in to my bag or pocket with ease. Great close up pics and the facility that picks up when a person smiles very useful.|#|The only negative thing about this camera is the on/off switch is very small so for a man it could be awkward to turn on and off.

2.0|#|Compact size, metal body with good build quality. Controls are easy to use even with cold hands or gloves on. Screen is bright and clear. Battery lasts a long time. Zoom is quick.|#|Image quality is very poor compared to other cameras in the same category. Auto focus is not fast, accurate or consistent. The camera struggles in bright conditions, and has rarely managed to capture the full dynamic range of the scene, even with its auto HDR photo. The WiFi sharing features are great, but cumbersome to use and very slow to upload.

9.0|#|Amazing photographs and terrific zoom.|#|To be fair haven't read up on all instructions yet!  but am disappointed that as yet it seems you cannot get the photos independently without using Play Memories and ordering via Snapfish, I don't wish to go via facebook. However this may be me being a slight technophobe!
9.0|#|The camera has lots of creative features, it takes great photos with vivid colors which are very true to life, it's also great for portraits. I have used it on holiday for day to day snaps as well as for macro and more professional use, it is a great all rounder and very good value for money even for beginners.|#|Sometimes the camera takes slightly blurry images if you use the wrong mode, I find the auto plus mode is easiest to use as it adjusts for you.

8.0|#|Easy to use and great zoom feature that varies it's speed of zoom which is handy when taking movies. I've not used all the features yet because there are so many. They've all been useful and not just gimmicks - well so far anyway. The intelligent calculator that sorts out shutter speed, aperture, focus and even type of picture is excellent.|#|I had a problem using the software that can be downloaded - it's called something like My Picture Home (MPH). My PC could see the camera but MPH couldn't. I couldn't work out why and evenually took my camera back to the shop. They said that there was a 'patch' due to fix this problem so in the mean time I've changed the camera settings back and I upload my pics using Microsoft Software. Pity because otherwise MPH looks great and I'm more than happy with the camera itself.

10.0|#|I like the touch sensitive screen rather than a whole series of buttons. I bought it for the automatic panorama feature which is truely amazing compared with the functions I have had on previous cameras (all produced by big name companies). I had not expected the picture quality to be so high and with the HD movie, who needs a camcorder. It is also incredibly small which means you can carry it with you at times when you would not bother to take a bigger camera. I am glad I did not buy the cheaper model as the sliding front does protect the lens from scratches.|#|The touch screen is not as sensitive as the one on my phone and sometimes needs more than one tap.

10.0|#|The picture quality is second to none.  The camera is just simplistic and not an arduous piece of equipment to use.  The panoramic sweep feature is superb as I have a Sony Satio phone with a panoramic feature on, but it is nowhere near as good as on the camera!|#|What bad points!??

10.0|#|The camera is really light with a great view of the picture.  It is really easy to use and takes great pictures.  It also has the panoramic feature which is really good.  You can set the camera to do most of the work for you if required.  Excellent value and good all rounder.|#|None so far. I have just taken it on our family holiday and loved it. 200 pictures taken in one week!
10.0|#|Very pleased I decided to buy this model, has some excellent features, picture quality is clear and crisp, (you still need a steady hand though), and HD recording is also very good.  Extremely easy to operate and very, very good value for money!  Set to auto it copes very well with light changes and focus.  Happy to recommend.|#|None with the camera that I have found so far, but to display on a HD TV you need the propriety HD lead, it really should have micro HDMI so that you can just plug it in!
8.0|#|Very small and light.  Easy to point and shoot.  Great panorama shots and the smile recognition feature is fun.  Easy to download the pictures.  Battery life is good - lasts a couple of days.|#|Battery is rechargable which isn't always convenient if it runs down while you're out and about.  Also - don't forget that you will need to buy a memory card for the phone as it doesn't come with one.

10.0|#|This camera is a great little gem. It is so light, I sometimes forget I have it in my pocket. The design is cool (typical for this brand). The picture quality is fantastic with the 14MP. I found the wide angle lens to be a great asset to have in a small camera - actually this is the first compact camera I've seen with wide angle lenses. The HD video capability is something quite valuable to have in case I don't have my HD camcorder with me.|#|The cover of the memory card and battery compartment seems a bit thin and fragile.

If I shoot at that time the photo will get increased brightness on the places where it was red on the display. When there is a strong wind the display view is not clear. Your advise is appreciated.

9.0|#|Clear screen and easy menu. Mostly intuitive. Love how it still takes good photos in low light without flash.|#|The shutter button is too close to the on/off so I have often turned it off rather than taking a photo and visa-versa.

1.0|#|It is easy to use because there is nothing to do.|#|Every thing is bad, like Image quality, it is to much slow to shutter, and slow to store the image in the memory card. it doesn't value for money, overall rating should be 1. I would not command anyone that never buy this camera.

8.0|#|This is an excellent product thats easy to use.  Its slim and lightweight which means it fits easily in the pocket.  This camera has numerous functions and shoot modes that makes it fun to use especially the panoramic shoot mode.  Good battery life also.  Would recommend it to anyone.|#|
9.0|#|Bought this camera primarily for use under water, in a special case available as an accessory, having seen the results of the previous model. Has an excellent Super Macro mode for getting up really close to your subject.|#|Battery does not seem to last long between charges.
9.0|#|Great camera packed full of useful features,great for me as i have two young kids. I sold my digital SLR for this camera and have not been disappointed. It is a little bit fiddly to hold and open and maybe use with one hand but i love it all the same. As far as value for money it is on the pricey side but my thought was it is a new camera but after looking around there's an awful lot out there to choose from. I have a lot of friends who now want this camera after seeing me use it at a wedding. Overall i will recommend it to all of my friends .|#|Bit fiddly to handle and open and use with one hand,battery life could do with being better.

9.0|#|This product is so slick and beautiful looking, for such a compact tiny camera it packs power where you need it, still and moving image wise its absolutely perfect even for  an amateur photographer, even low light photos are brilliant for this point and shoot. Movies recorded on it play with no problems on the PS3, no need for conversion. I love this camera.|#|Plus reduce the price Sony.
8.0|#||#|Very difficult to see images on the screen, particularly in bright sunlight. Also difficult to see what the camera is focussing on for the same reason. A viewfinder would make this camera complete and brilliant.

9.0|#|Easy to use, good picture quality, plenty of features.|#|The lens protector on the front of the camera is not automatic, so when you switch the camera off you have to remember to slide the casing. This is ok, but I feel that a camera of this cost should do this automatically.
9.0|#|Easy to use touch screen, great picture quality. Like the slide cover as it keeps the lens protected|#|Bit annoying that it only takes sony memory stick instead of normal SD, but the camera does connect easily to the computer using the USB lead supplied.

Picture quality is good especially night shots and those at low light levels. No decernable chromatic aberations (blue edging on high contrst shots) Good quality video especially at indoor live concerts etc.|#|Can't reload edited photos diectly from the computer to the camera unless the Sony software is installed. This is a minor gripe only because I don't like installing a number of similar programs on my system.
9.0|#|great features to enhance photo images|#|

7.0|#|Good quality build and picture quality. Ultra slim, very stylish, great range of colours. Easy to operate. Some fun quirky functions with the touch screen - you can 'draw' on pictures with the aide of the little stylus provided, there are wee clip art stamps that are fun. The new 'sweep panorama' facility is fab for keen landscapers and their new 'Exmor' sensor helps in lower light photo's too.|#|white' mode/colour modes. Not essential, but nice to have anyway. More down-loadable edit options would've been nice - but again, not hugely necessary. The newer range than TX1 are able to accept SD memory cards now - it's a shame this one doesn't (MemoryStick Pro Duo only), but It takes pictures well  - and that what it's made for after all.

9.0|#|Excellent - well made, nice heavy (but not too heavy!) feel in the hand. Love the turn on/off by sliding front cover, love that lens is built-in. Great size so good for almost any event!|#|That and accessories (screen protector and sony camera case) were rather pricey.

Would have expexted to have been given a camera case and a memory card with the purchase as expensive. cannot use any other memerory card so becomes very expensive when buying accessories
9.0|#|I bought this camera after my DSC-T1 developed an electronic fault.  I found it easy to get into its workings and have enjoyed suing some of its new, additional features.  I shall experiment with some of the more esooteric features.  I have found that I take a lot of panoramic views and I have found the pannorama feature excellent.|#|I find it difficult to see the screne image in bright sunlight - buts thats the nature of the beast.
9.0|#|s|#|none
9.0|#|Pocket Size, Light Weight and very easy to use with good features.|#|The plastic lock cover to battery compartment could wear quickly due to battery removal for recharging. Early models had a metal cover and battery could be recharged in place.
9.0|#|The Panoramic /mode is fantastic. So easy to use and viewing on camera is amazing.  Also the calander view mode is an easy and effective way to find the photos you want instead of hour of scrolling!|#|Screen does easily get finger marks on but they are easily wiped off or just use the small pointer pen that comes with it.  Otherwise faultless so far!

9.0|#|The camera was purchased as a gift for a holiday to Arizona/Grand Canyon. The quality of the pictures is stunning but even better was the video. We took an old video camera but when compared with the video shot with this camera the difference is amazing like VHS and DVD. The image is HD so looks like it was shot on a good quality video camera. Simply a joy to use, I would recommend this camera to anyone as it takes stunning pictures and video, is easy to use with the large touch screen and cost over a hundred pounds less than Sony were offering.|#|Hardly any internal memory, (enough for two photos...). This is generally the case with most cameras, unfortunatally, meaning that you are forced to spend more money on a memory card.
10.0|#|does alot more than I thought it did. this is done with ease once you remember where the features are but even then not too hard to find.|#|
10.0|#|I cannot find one negative thing to say about it other than the shutter is a little awkard to open, but I can see the point in it being that way anyway.....hey nothings perfect.......but i think this camera might be!|#|opening shutter can be awkward.
9.0|#|Looks Good|#|Quite expensive
9.0|#|This is a cracking camera, well made, compact, light and simple to use. The images are particularly clear especially in low light. Finger over the lens is a bit of a pest but that is a user problem not the camera. I have had a few easy to use digital's but this is the best by far.|#|None really
9.0|#|Wanted a good spec camera that would fit in pocket for days/nights out as cant be bothered carrying it. Performs this role excellently. Packed with features though can also use easily. Major improvements in low light conditions thanks to the CMOS sensor.|#|Image quality seems slightly worse that similar priced cameras however opted for this one due to size.
10.0|#|Very easy to use, really impressed with the camcorder function too. picture quality is as good as I have seen in all my previous cameras. Suprised how small the camera is, taking into account the overall quality and features, This really is a superb camera for the money.|#|None
9.0|#|Ease of use when used to menu system, very good build quality, LCD quality, decent picture quality, better high ISO noise reduction (than some previous models), excellent macro mode, Intelligent Autofocus.|#|User menu still slightly over complicated (better than previous models), zoom rocker smaller than previous models (more fiddly to zoom), poor battery life (opt for additional battery which is expensive), Bought separately the Sony LCD screen protector does not fit this LCD even though its meant too!

10.0|#|Image quality, ease of use, build quality, 7 frames per second in continuous shooting mode.|#|None that are significant. Because it has so many features it takes time to learn what everything does, and the manual is not that clear. But take your time and play and soon enough you'll get to grips with it.
10.0|#|Fantastic HD video that look fabulous played via USB connection (cable included) on 42 inch TV. Great still images and very fast focus and shoot. Very comfortable to handle.|#|Battery doesn't last as long as previous DSLR.

9.0|#|Superb video quality. Auto focus hunts ocassionally but generally works very well. Using in manual focus is recommended, when various subjects in the frame can be brought into focus, enabling the footage to look more film-like. Also, compared to to even an good quality camcorder, the ability to change lens gives huge options for various techniques. (Wild life, landscape, sports, close-ups, family etc).  Microphone connection for better quality audio.|#|No output for headphones to let you hear what the camera is picking up. Speech may be too distant, or if your independent mic battery goes flat you aren't to know.

9.0|#|Excellent quality pictures.|#|*No swing veiwing screen !!* (like previous models had, so hard to do high/low shots) why ? this was an excellent feature!
10.0|#|Really pleased with this camera. I've just traded up from a compact so I don't really know what I'm doing yet - It is just as straightforward to use this as it was the compact but it also has all the features you want in an SLR so you can learn as you go along. Would certainly make the same decision again.|#|A tilting screen would be good but I'm not that bothered... I would've bought the A55 if I was!
10.0|#|Really happy with this. This is my first SLR, just traded up from a compact. The auto function make it easy to make the switch and it has all the bells and whistles so I can learn to do things properly. Blown away by the difference in image quality. Torn between this and a Nikon, this won because the image stabilisation is in the camera rather than the lens which makes the lenses cheaper.|#|Haven't found any yet.
9.0|#|The camera is very light changing lenses is very easy the auto focus is very good Image quality is excellent compared to my other none DSLR cameras|#|There is no case like my previous SLR camera I found the Instruction manual very deep and hard to follow, to enable me to gain the full potential of the camera

9.0|#|Small and compact great for travelling. Great picture quality.|#|Could have better zoom.
10.0|#|Very neat, slim and small enough to slip in a pocket. Positive zoom action and rapid shutter response. Zeiss lens gives superb definition.  Clear settings information on screen.|#|Panorama action less easy to get right - left to right not too bad, but I haven't yet managed to master the up and down movement to the camera's satisfaction.
9.0|#|A great product for everyday use, and one I look forward to fully getting to grips with.|#|It would be nice to have a slightly larger LCD screen on the rear of the camera for reviewing shots, but this is a minor point and you can zoom in from the options menu anyway for reviewing.
9.0|#|The image quality is excellent plus it has the benefit of sweep panorama which is very easy to use as well as smile recognition and face focus.|#|The buttons are difficult to use if you have larger hands or long finger nails!

3.0|#|Probably the size. But that's how most modern cameras are. Therefore, wouldn't see it as the differentiating point.|#|Image quality not good. I had expected it to be great. Tried different options as well. Does't work. Images with less light are very blurry and not sharp.
6.0|#|I like the panorama feature which is easy to use and gives good results.|#|Tends to overexpose pictures so the image is too light.  Not enough ability to customise use eg difficult to overcome the overexposure and change to different exposure.  It is long-winded to delete a photo - you choose delete and then have to choose the image to delete and then confirm - slower than other cameras - this is a critical feature as it is the prime benefit of having a digital camera, to be able to see and quickly delete poor quality photos.

8.0|#|I had been looking everywhere for a good camera. This camera I have to say, has won me over. It is Sony and is good quality. The pictures come out very clear, high quality. It is really easy to use. It feels really light to use, and very compact. The zoom in and out is brilliant and so are the features including smile detection. I highly recommend this product.|#|I HAD to return mine only due to the fact that there was a dead pixel on the camera. Othewise I would highly recommend it.
9.0|#|I als have a Digital SLR, but it is a bit big for just carrying around, this fills that job very well|#|shoot camera which it does do well
9.0|#|This camera is the best I have ever owned -- and that in 60 years of photography. The size makes carrying it very easy; the image is superb. The use of either SD card or duo-pro is an advantage to those os us who own several cameras. All round I would recommend this camera to anybody.|#|
8.0|#||#|Lack of a manual that is comprensive.  It is extremly annoying to have to download pages from computer. I bought camera just before going on holiday and was unable to get to a computer and the booklet supplied was just too brief to be able to use camera to its full capacity.

10.0|#|The picture quality is excellent for a digital camera. This camera is extremely easy to use, you just turn it on and away you go. The features of this camera are much better than my previous camera which was a Panasonic lumix which only had still shots and movie recording. The build quality is the best i have ever seen in a digital camera with solid metal and extremely light. Video quality of this camera is absolutely amazing, crystal clear and looks amazing when exported in HD using IMovie.

1.0|#|It is small and compact and fits into my bag nicely.|#|I purchased this camera just for the panoramic sweep feature but have found that this is very difficult to use and leaves me extremely frustrated.   The fact that this camera does not have a viewfinder means that on a sunny day it is difficult to see what I am filming.
8.0|#|Easy to use - I did not need to refer to any instructions. I have only used this for one holiday trip but it gave no problems in the 2 weeks I was away.|#|Can't really seem to to find any yet. Maybe having the on-off button further away from the button to take pictures?

The camera is very compact and if you have it in your pocket at, say a wedding, you dont even know you have it. We found it hard to believe we could get a camera of this quality for the money. Finally, the zoom works very fast and focusses quickly too.|#|The manual for anything other than basic operation needs to be printed from the disk and is a hefty document. The flap that is opened to remove the battery is a little flimsy, this is the only non metal part on the camera casing - be careful when removing battery for charging.

9.0|#|panaramic pics and ease of use|#|not really a bad point,but as a bit of a novice with cameras,I have still to discover some of the many functions of the camera
8.0|#|Camera is very easy to use and initial set up is straightforward.  This camera is for people who want to point and shoot, picture quality very good.  Lots of extra things available via disc if required.|#|Initial charging misleading, I left until yellow light extinguished and assumed battery was fully charged.  On 2nd use of camera battery expired after taking 1 shot.  I went back to the shop where I purchased camera and was informed by assistant to take notice of light but to leave on charge overnight.  No problems since.
4.0|#|Neat and small. Good Zoom even when taking movies. Good for taking close-ups.|#|Have difficulty quite often in seeing the object I am photographing when in bright sunlight.

9.0|#|This is easy to use, once you have mastered what button is which. Panoramic is a very good feature, I used to have to use two cameras but now only the one.

10.0|#|It's small and light.  It's easy to get the hang of and use frequently with ease.  The video option on the camera is so much better than i thought it would be and with an 8GB memory card it holds loads of video footage.  The panoramic option is great fun to use.  Whenever i have a chance i'm using it.|#|

9.0|#|LOVING THE PANERAMIC VIEW PICTURES|#|NONE SO FAR
8.0|#|The panaramic shot is fantastic. Took the camera to New Zealand and got some great shots around South Island. The 14m megapixels gives great clarity. I took a small tripod and the camera gave some really good images on max zoom (but see also bad points). The menus are easy to navigate and you can find the type of shot you want (landscape etc). I would recommend this as a compact to take on holiday and general day to day use.|#|The zoom is weak. My partner has a similar Fuji and the zoom on that is far superior to this camera. Occaisionally the camera does not switch on immediately, leading to frustration if a quick shot was needed. But overall these are minor irritations.

10.0|#|East to use, excellent quality and a good price. What more could you want.|#|
8.0|#|The sweep panorama is great, much easier than having to stitch photos together.  The 14.1 mega pixels mean that the picture can be enlarged or zoomed in closer without losing definition.  Colour and detail come out well.|#|Its a shame that the zoom doesn't work on the sweep panorama as this would be useful for some landscape photos.
9.0|#|great size, nice screen, easy to use, good lens, easy to use on pc, just love it.|#|

10.0|#|Love the W350L, it's small, so it is easy to carry around with me, as I also take it to work, it fit's in my pocket. I think it's the best one you can buy for the money and the image quality is excellent. The photos are easy to download.|#|I think that it should have a sports setting on it.

5.0|#|Its very light and small, easy to carry around in a pocket. Panoramic mode is OK|#|Too many features/settings, intelligent mode isn't very intelligent. Settings have to keep being changed to get a good photo, not very good on a night out - pictures aren't great, either too much flash or not enough light. Very blurry photos of a night out unless aggressive flash is used then pics are too bright, night portraits of lit buildings also blurry. Lots of faffing around needed to find the settings to get a decent photo. You can't move even slightly if taking a picture. Zoom response is slow. Touch screen is a pain in the backside. The old T100 was far superior to use and a more solid build than this - i doubt this will survive an accidental drop

3.0|#|It is very lightweight.|#|Unable to see the picture on the screen in daylight.  Unable to read the menue in daylight.  Therefore only able to use the camera inside!

10.0|#|All are good, cannot fault anything|#|
8.0|#|Very Slim and easy to use, panoramic feature is great, internal optical zoom.|#|could do with a couple of more buttons, for some of the menu's. It's about time Sony switched to the SD or microSD memory cards, which are a lot cheaper, more compatible with laptops, tv's etc and do exactly the same as their memory stick.

10.0|#|I bought this for my 80 year old mum because I have a cybershot myself and love it. Even though it seems tiny, like mine it's ergonomic, straightforward and picture quality is sharp and colour balance better than vast majority of friends' cameras. She is delighted.|#|I saw another review that said the battery eject wasn't very slick. I agree with this but it isn't that bad and just shows that it can't be bad if that's its worst fault.
4.0|#|it takes pictures|#|not worth the money, you can buy cheaper cameras that do a better job and not error your images plus panoramic function is a joke

7.0|#|Good quality picture and easy of operation within the straightforward setting not quiet so on othes. Picture quality very good.|#|Have not been able to find how to turn of review screen to save battery use, lack of separate viewing eye would prevent me from purchasing another or similar, due to this factor alone will only retain for short time.
9.0|#|Slim and lightweight.|#|Nothing yet.
5.0|#|Looked great|#|is not compatible with Apple computer so had to take it back to the shop
9.0|#|Everything is automatic so you don't need to know much about photography to use the DSC-W570.The sweep panorama feature is magic . Being able to do 720p HD video means you don't need to carry two cameras.Uses readily available SDHC memory cards.|#|Can't think of any.

4.0|#|It is very compact|#|Image quality is not good
5.0|#|A small and easy to use compact camera. Easy to use features. Stylish.|#|Zoom is very 'clunky'. Anti red eye found to be quite poor.
4.0|#|Scan and hd movie features are reasonable|#|I thought that the image quality would be exceptional, being 16 mp, but it is apparently no better than my last Nikon camera, which was rated at 7 mp

10.0|#|IDEAL FOR A KEEN AMATURE AND CAN BE PROGRAMED DOWN FOR SEND LOADS OF PHOTOS ON EMAIL|#|
9.0|#|Battery seems to last for ages, the build quality is what you'd expect from S0ny. Good list of features and modes to use. Compact and light to carry around.|#|Some images come out rather grainy (especially the sweeping pictures)

9.0|#|The picture quality is very good particular inside|#|
10.0|#|Really easy to use, sharp clear pictures, it IS SONY and good quality. Would highly recommend it. Easy to charge and take pics off camera too. 4.5 stars|#|the battery lid is a little weak when closing, but its no big deal.

9.0|#|Small, handy, nice quality.|#|
5.0|#|small, compact, looks good|#|quality not worth price
8.0|#|lovely new gadget|#|there was this small dot mark near the outer lense area
10.0|#|very compact and easy to use.  would definitely recommend for a no nonsense point and shoot camera.|#|
5.0|#|Small and compact, you can carry this camera at all times without noticing it but have always got it when you need it.|#|until you want to take a picture.  Feels very fragile - shame it's not made of metal.  No black and white photo option.  The panoramic feature doesn't take a whole 360 degree picture (WHY not?).  The zoom motor is easily audible on videos.  Not enough control over flash settings.  Impossible to operate the on-off button when wearing gloves (have missed some good photo opportunities this winter because of this).
8.0|#|Small, good screen, lots of features|#|No viewfinder, no printed or printable manual, no memory card
9.0|#|light weight - easy to work - good quality photos|#|on-off switch and tab to open battery area flimsy
9.0|#|Good value for money, great image quality, easy to use, fits perfectly in my hand bags.|#|The battery cover can be easily broken if not handled with care.
9.0|#|Almost idiot proof.|#|Why isn't a memory card provided as standard since nobody is going to rely on an internal memory which holds 4 pictures.
8.0|#|Sweep panorama is fun and easy to use|#|No manual mode to set aparture/shutter time/ISO  manually
7.0|#|Image quality is quite good and then panorama is fab..:)|#|somtimes images lack a bit of depth and look quite flat...mostly indoor ones unlike my previous kodak camera.
10.0|#|Fantastic camera with some excellent features, image quality second to none. Simple to use and gives results which would usually be seen on far more expensive cameras.|#|None that I have found yet. If anything more of a recommendation, bluetooth connectivity would be a useful addition.
7.0|#|It's a very simple, easy to use digitial camera with a few features to fine tune pictures. It's smaller than most digital camera's out there and fits in your pocket.|#|Fairly slow shutter speed when shooting at 16m. Even turning the camera on and waiting for the lens to come out takes a good few seconds. Build quality is debateable. Has a very plastic feel, touch wood, i dont drop it!
5.0|#||#|takes time to click
9.0|#|Lightweight, image tracking (to stop shaky pictures), easy to use.  Compact - perfect everyday camera.  Also I got the pink colour which is not available everywhere!!!|#|Clangy music when you turn it on! Quite loud shutter noise on taking photos but overall a great camera!
9.0|#|There's plenty to name ...|#|Battery runs out quickly
7.0|#|It's quick loading up and is generally good in all areas.|#|Is there no sports shot? I can't seem to stop blurring on moving items. Also my camera is in the repair shop because it was dropped on the floor and now has a broken lens mechanism. Pretty weak build quality as it was not dropped from a great height and landed on soft flooring.

9.0|#||#|A little hard to understand - I would prefer a book to refer to instead of having to go into the menu all the time.
8.0|#|the taking of panoramic pictures without having to stich on the computer is great. Also easy to handle and keep in a pocket.|#|Very poor quality picture when taken inside on full zoom, dark and orange in colour even with flash on, very dissapointed with this Sony you can do a lot better.
9.0|#||#|Haven't found any yet.
9.0|#|light, easy to use, love the panorama feature|#|-
6.0|#|it's very small and perfect for people knowing nothing about digital photography|#|On macro unable to take a clear shoot if distance is too short. Macro shoot from distance using magnification with flash always blured. No chance of adjusting shooter speed or exposure manually only few programs to choose from making it dificult to blur water in a waterfall by extending time. You can try using fireworks program but it's not adjustable program.
4.0|#||#|Image quality was terrible, washed out colours, images looked to have a watercouour effect. I was very disappointed.

5.0|#|picture quality is good and download software is easy to use|#|Also the download software does not allow you to clear the camera memory directly.
9.0|#|the panaramic is brilliant and the quality of picture really good|#|i paid half price but fll price would be way to much
5.0|#|Slim, light and fits nicely in pocket.|#|Indoor flash photo's poor and not quick, so the delay in pressing shutter to actual photo means that the subject, e.g. a child,  moves from a pose so what you want to capture is not final result. Red eye on virtually every photo.

8.0|#|So easy to keep in a pocket. Easy to download on to computer too. Landscape feature effective.|#|This isn't really a bad point, but I wish the shutter speed was faster. I'd like to photograph the image I see, not one a moment later. However I haven't investigated the feature for photographing children thoroughly yet. This may have the answer.
9.0|#|easy to focus|#|on/off button a bit small, last bit of charge on battery goes quickly

8.0|#|Compact, lightweight, anti-shake is very good|#|Badly in need of a viewfinder! It's nearly impossible to see what photo you are about to take in sunny conditions.
9.0|#|Very Compact Camera. Panorama feature is very usefull to me which is why I originally bought the camera. 16Mp was also a strong selling point.Very usefull to have everything in one unit. Video Camera, Panorama Camera and Still Camera.|#|I actually have very big Hands, and the on/off switch is very awkward for people like me. A viewfinder would have been a bi advantage as well especially in bright sunlight.
9.0|#|compact, can fit easily into pocket or bag, quite easy to use.|#|Battery and sd card flap seems to be very flimsy, I think this may fail if knocked when open
9.0|#|good size too.|#|Can't download onto any computer unless you have the correct software
2.0|#|Nice compact well built and light weight camera. Quick to start up and shoot.|#|Intelligent auto mode is poor, the images are always slightly blurred and the colour is poor (at least 85% blurred!?).  No matter what circumstances. I've tried indoor/outdoor, with/without flash, normal/macro, scenery/buildings/people/animals, still/motion shots, all weathers and the different settings (including out of intelligent auto mode).  Focal point and depth of field is is very small leading to the poor image quality. Very disappointed with this camera, really has put me off the brand (sorry Sony, we wanted this as a smaller camera than our Sony Cybershot DSC - H5). I'm not comparing this to SLR or more expensive cameras that woud not be a fair comparison. Compared to other cameras in that price range it is not the best camera to buy. Looking to change it asap.
10.0|#|fast start up, compact enough toslip into a pocket, easily switch between photo, panoramic and video use, solid feels good when using|#|nothing that I can think of

9.0|#|very easy to use. easy to follow getting to work instructions|#|none so far
6.0|#||#|Average performance and a number of problems. Error message appears when switched on that this memory card may not record or play and yet it is a sony memory card. HD video function can take time to change focus on the move and the automatic focus selection for the still camera is not consistent in showing the macro setting. Body feels somewhat flimsy and battery power is poor. The difference in picture quality between my old 7mp Sony and this 16mp Sony is marginal.
2.0|#|Panarama is excellent|#|camera is too small
8.0|#|small, multi-featured, easy to use, good quality, excellent value for size|#|Also having a few problems with the auto flash - doesn't always come on when I think it should and have had to delete several attempts. Probably me - I expect I'll get it sorted eventually.

9.0|#|easy to use|#|no camera case
10.0|#|Good clear pictures with vibrant true colours, the 10x zoom is great and the lens allows sufficient light together with the stabilisation to reduce the effect of unsteady hands at full zoom. The panorama shooting is amazing just press the shutter button and scan your 270deg shot and by magic it's a full panorama.|#|Only one bad point that concerns me it is slow between shots, so if you think you are likely to repeat a shot quickly use the burst facility.
8.0|#|Great camera at the price for latest model.. Lots of features|#|solid as my last Cybershot (DSC200)

8.0|#|Weight. Quick focus. Large screen|#|
10.0|#|Amazing quality pictures even after 'fixing' on the computer and zooming in to produce a close up.|#|No real Bad points, maybe slight adjustment to strap attachment to case and somehow making it a bit easier not to touch the screen when putting back in case.
10.0|#|it is quite easy to use this is the  5th Sony camera which I have purchased over the years.|#|I would like a view finder because I live in Spain where the light is very bright. This can make taking photos in the open quite tricky at times.

10.0|#|This camera takes STUNNING,PIN SHARP,PERFECTLY EXPOSED pictures.The results are unbelievable.The camera is compact enough to fit into your pocket,or handbag.Although compact,it returns absolutely perfect shots every time the button is pressed,which would only be expected of a much bulkier,heavy camera.|#|The battery life is a bit heavy,although with all the (all singing,all dancing features) were turned off.The battery died at the important times.I would recommend any buyer to also purchase a spare battery or two.However,do not be put off by this.The results you will get ARE STUNNING.

8.0|#|Opens fast, has many features. Small. Lightweight. Quiet. Zoom while recording movies.|#|Difficult to grab, I always fear that it will slip from my fingers. Maybe better if it had more flat perimeter. Recording and on/off buttons too close.  Also there is a little delay when taking pics, so i miss the right moment often. Too grainy after 400 ISO.

9.0|#|Compact and versatile. Great build quality, well-considered controls. Fast enough and good image quality.|#|Shame the screen is not touch-sensitive. Probably not good for large hands (mine are not). detail from the 16-50 lens is a bit of a compromise but very impressed with 55-210. Pay mechanism for Play Memories software downloads is problematic. Play Memories management software is not impressive - I have not managed to get images deleted from a card except by prodding at the camera, and editing facilities are lacking things like correction of vertical perspective.
10.0|#|The compact size is what attracted me. Good range of lenses and accessories. Wireless feature looks useful. I have used smartphone app to trigger camera remotely (avoiding camera shake).|#|Purchased Sony Flash (F43) and then realised needed to pay for an adaptor which delayed being able to use the flash.

8.0|#|generally very easy to use.|#|I would have liked to have had a proper hand book rather than a downloaded version only.  I have great computer skills and use alot of different software it is just that it would have been great to have an handbook to use when you are out with the camera and want to look something up there and then to improve a shot
9.0|#|Features good, lightweight despite size appearance, the size however comfortable in hands, and sweep panorama gives amazing photos,|#|but the feature may take a while to get use to , what's bad is that for those who require other modes such as macro etc. you can not switch to these functions manually its only on auto

9.0|#|having only used the camera at wembley the pictures came out very well the zoom shots were very good and the video was very good overall thi am very happy with this camera|#|when buying it the camera came without a cover or sd card which you have to take into consideration
8.0|#|I haven't had it very long but I think battery life is very reasonable - it has a lithium battery (I wouldn't go for a camera which takes 'aa' batteries again).|#|Nothing much - the cable on the battery charger is crazily short (no more than 12 inches), but not neccessarily a problem.
10.0|#|for an amateur user i found it easy to use,I liked the video function and the panaramic sweep , nice and compact and eaeasy to put in a coat pocket|#|none found
9.0|#|The good thing is it compact, light and has a large viewing screen. Great close up image quality and ideal. It's 14 MP is ideal for enlargeing photos to poster size.|#|It is harder find and decide which is the best mode for each photo situation but guess with time I will get used to using this camera. Could have done afew extras and such as coming with a free camera case.

It can be very difficult to frame a shot in bright sunlight from the LCD screen, almost impossible to see an image to frame correctly. So please, add a viewfinder to this otherwise excellent camera.

7.0|#|Everything!|#|I'm a fan of trying to figure functions out for myself, and find doing so difficult. It just means that I have to read the pamphlet.
1.0|#|It looks great and is intuitive to use.  High spec for the money.|#|The video camera facility kept drifting in and out of focus - I looked it up online and found that lots of people were having the same problem.  When taking stills the flash was blindingly bright, meaning that in any photos taken of people using flash they were squinting.  These 2 problems meant that the camera eventually went back to the shop for a refund, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it.
1.0|#|The reason I bought this camera for my son who already had a cybershot was because of the panoramic feature.  This was brilliant for landscapes and other shots.|#|The panoramic feature seemed to detract from the other features.  i.e. the shots went in and out of focus.  When reviewing shots white lines slashed across the screen between shots. Picture quality was bad compared with previous cybershot camera.  The battery compartment door was at the bottom of the camera when on previous cameras it was on the side.  Whenever my son was taking a picture the battery compartment door dropped open.  I returned the camera to the retailer for a refund.  Maybe we were unluckly and it was just this one camera that was faulty as we have had several  cameras of the same make and no problem ever occurred before.  Most of my other products are by the same manufacrer.

9.0|#|camera seems well made, not too light but ok to carry in a pocket, good size screen and bright enough to view in most conditions, both optical and digital zoom work well and the panoramic option can provide some effective landscapes.|#|The battery / memory card cover at the base of the camera has inadevertantly opened, the fastening could be a bit more positive.  The slight delay in the retractionof the lens after operating the on / off button may give the impression that you have not pressed the button, causing you to re-press the button and switch the camera on again!

The  onboard software also contains 'shooting tips' which is a very helpful feature to get the best shots. Picture quality is excellent and camera/lens construction first class. The 16mm pancake lens is a beauty and after reading some excellent reviews on the internet I have decided that my next purchase will be the ultra wide converter to fit on that lens. A quality product and the next best option to a full blown DSLR.|#|The LCD screen appears to be sensitive to scratching easily. I unfortunately gained a slight scratch within the first couple of days, so have now protected it with an acrylic screen protectors.Sony accessories are expensive, especially a spare battery (if you can get one ). I have a third party manufactured spare battery which cost a fraction of the cost of an original Sony battery, but be sure that this battery has an updated 100% decoded chip onboard. This latest model of NEX-3 camera will not recognise some makes of third party batteries.

8.0|#|The camera itself is very lightweight and when a small lens is fitted, provides digital SLR performance in a pocket size. Features such as panorama have given me some of the best pictures I have ever taken. Video recording is excellent. Picture quality is superb.|#|My biggest problem is lack of remote control,or even possibility of cable shutter release (I am intending to use the camera for astrophotography in the near future and even though I have a good telescope (a Meade LX90 on a very steady mount) lack of these functions will make life more difficult with long exposures.Navigating the menus can be fiddly -particularly in cold weather.

Low image noise until very high ASA speeds are selected above 3200. 16 Mega pixel sensor gives stunning quality images. Lenes are of good quality allowing the best use of the sensor resolution.|#|The add-on flash gun is good but it could have been built-in. It would have made the camera body a bit bigger which is probably why it was not built-in. Zoom range 18 to 35 mm is not great but image quality is excellent. The lowest ASA rating is 200 which is rather high but similar to other cameras.

Jammed packed full of useful features, enough to make DSLR's that are a few years old look very bland. Great light handling capabilities thanks to a great sensor, with high ISO range. A delight to use.|#|Awkward menu system. Not as many tactile buttons as an SLR which may be good if upgrading from a normal compact, but not so good if using as a second camera for SLR users. Lenses are expensive, something the point and shooters won't be used to.

The panoramic shooting mode is incredible and a lot of fun to play around with. Very well admired when out and about!|#|I feel it was well worth the money I paid (although inevitably the price has dropped since I bought it)   but the branded accessories are expensive, particularly the 70 - 300 mm lens which costs more than the camera itself. Some features are difficult to get to in the menu system but once you get used to them they become easier.

10.0|#|I read so many reviews about this camera, checked out so many videos on you-tube. I was finally ready to purchase the camera at what I thought was a high price but would be worthwhile.. To my surprise the camera was even better than I thought. Video quality is better than what is shown on all the youtube videos and the pictures are great. They keep adding extra functionality to it. The 3D pics do work, just mae sure you purchase the correct 3D HDMI cable for the camera. I'm so happy i bought the camera. Im not a photographer but I love images. I'm not disappointed. The low light is great as well, the flash is good. Very stylish camera.|#|I find it a little confusing to use it but I think I'll just learn in time. I think it's less the cameras fault and more mine as I don't fully understand all the terminology and photography lingo. Battery life I would say is about a day and half of constant picture/video taking. Otherwise i'm sure it would last longer although I am considering getting another battery as it takes a few hours to charge. Not good if you forget to charge it. I'm still so happy I purchased it.
5.0|#|Light, portable, good functions, good image quality|#|fit to other lens adaptor (even manufacturer auto lenses) means that you have to use manual focus - which rather defeats the object.  Until third party or more cost effective manufacturer lenses come out, I have to downgrade the overall rating, as the camera is not much good for nature or wildlife use - the main reason I wanted the camera.
10.0|#|This is what I've been waiting for years|#|it's all about the bad points
7.0|#|lots of features. Small camera|#|Have had to spend a lot of extra money to buy accesories like view finder, zoom lens and  lens adaptor. I found difficulty with the screen in bright weather, so I purchased a Sony viewfinder. The sony view finder I purchased does not talk to the camera, so doesn't zoom, a waste of my money.  I originally bought a cheaper zoom lens and even with the lens adaptor the camera wouldn't talk to it so I had to buy a Sony lens. The lens  I purchased is so slow to automatic focus and I miss some good shots. I have found the macro will not always focus, and you don't always have time to manual focus. It does not record images in order I have taken them  so when I download and catergorise the images are dotted around. Overall I spent far more money than I expected and have been very disappointed. With the larger lens In dull weather the images have been very poor. Some images I have recorded look fantastic on the screen but when I download they are not always in focus or completely clear!!!!!  Overall I have been very disappointed, it has taken months of practice with it and getting used to it. I was always happy with my previous camera and should have just upgraded with that.
9.0|#|The balance, feel, build quality and ergonomics of this camera suit me perfectly and was the reason I walked out of the shop with this rather than a Panasonic micro 4/3rds, which to me just didn't feel right - personal opinion I know, but when I picked up the NEX 5 it immediately seemed in a different league. Very pleased with my choice. Haven't tried the video modes yet (not my interest) so no comments one way or the other.|#|, but I would always feel the need for a spare (expensive).

9.0|#|i have recently taken it on a coach trip, where a number of passengers had large slr cameras, as indeed i have , they are very cumbersome compared to my camera, this being my major reason for my purchase, also the large camera owners were unable to take movies, panoramic views, and were not h.d. a wonderfully easy to use camera, i am not overly technical by any means so really do appreciate this.|#|i bought the camera, it came with flash, i then decided i needed a viewfinder, which of course you find on a normal slr, i find i can take shots for instance within churches without the flash which is handy, because i wouldn,t like to find myself constantly unscrewing the viewfinder to fit the flash, and the other way round. i realise this is all due to the fact that the body size is so small. i have now purchased a lens adaptor so i can fit my normal slr lenses, and i am wondering why it was not possible to design the camera to accept the larger lenses. there has to be a good technical reason.but of course viewfinder, lens adaptor is all additional cost, next purchase a screen protector, i could,nt find in the shops.

9.0|#|A really lightweight camera, with a good range of ISO settings and a decently wide aperture setting for taking photos in poor quality light (the reason I bought it). I'm thrilled with the panorama function, which has completely done away with the need to stitch photos together. I got the 18-55 lens with mine, which has produced reasonably crisp images at a range of depths of field. I've only had to sharpen one or two in a picture editing programme - but that could be down to my camera skills! I've also been able to use my M42 lenses, with an adapter, and have achieved some lovely shots with those. The menus are simple to navigate, the manual setting is great for taking control over the end image, but the auto setting is useful for those times when you just want to point and shoot. Compared with the Panasonic GF2 I was intending to get, the build quality of the NEX is higher and the range of functions is wider and more relevant to the type of photography I do (gigs, night shots, long exposures).|#|It was more expensive than the camera I had set out to buy, and the lens prices are a bit steep for my pocket as well. The lightweight body makes using some of my older M42 lenses difficult, as the centre of gravity shifts and means a tripod is essential.

8.0|#|The NEX5 is just a super lightweight digital SLR which I purchased for bird photography using the SE18200 zoom lens. When bird watching I am loaded down with telescope, tripod and binoculars and weight is a major issue.|#|I am concerned about the weight of the SE18200 zoom lens putting strain on the camera body when mounting the camera on a tripod. For peace of mind I modified a Manfrotto 293 zoom lens support to ensure no excess strain is put on the camera body.The modified Manfrotto 293 acts as a cradle, carrying the NEX5 and SE18200 as a self contained modular package which I can pull out of my bag and clip on to my tripod when needed.

The menu system takes a little getting used to as some of the functions are hidden away where you wouldn't look intuitively and regularly used functions such as manual/auto focus can be a bit unweildy to get at. There's a lot to learn and I'm still at an early stage but the signs are good!

Firmware 3 essential (for programmable buttons); Firmware 4 nice (for extra effects).  Ability to take Raw as well as jpegs.|#|I should've bought the 2 lens kit instead of just the zoom lens kit.  Larger than a compact digicam (but with all the features of a dSLR in a much more compact form).  External flash slightly fiddly to fit (but easy to use).

10.0|#|The picture quality, shutter speed and quality of the lcd screen are second to none! I love the fact that is it so compact with the punch of a larger DSLR. The high def video is excellent, and the fact that you can shoot in more than two formats really helps for editing. As my first DSLR I've picked it up and used it quite easily.|#|Difficult to find one!! I would say that it needs an optical view finder but I don't miss it. I think the 3D panoramic function, although nice to have, is mostly pointless. If there are people in the shot they better be standing still or you get a blur.

8.0|#|techy inclined senior who hitherto relied on my wife for all snaps, I have found that  the Nex 5 has awaken an unrecognised desire to join the ranks of the enthusiast. Not content with the 18-55 lens I have gone as far as purchasing the La-Ea1 adapter and a 2nd hand Minolta 75-300mm zoom lens, and have to say the firmware assists for manual focusing are superb; even more so with the v4 peaking function.|#|The cost of the current Nex 5, 50-200 lens, and the unavailability of a Nex 5 alternative.
8.0|#|Great image quality for size. Ability to use other lenses with adapters. Manual focusing is easy when LCD permits.|#|Lack of Electronic View Finder. With one this camera would be sensational and a serious alternative to a DSLR despite it's much smaller size.
9.0|#|picture quality, size, low weight, ease of use|#|can take a while to set up advanced features
9.0|#|Purchased before a trip to South Africa - and a couple of safari's - my camera has been awesome.  The facility to take a large number of photographs - stills, movies, and sweep panorama's - without the need constantly to download was a huge bonus (no need for a computer).  The charging facilities provided are well considered being neat, light and taking up very little space.  The build quality is very good indeed.  This is a camera that will be with me for a long time.  To have such a capability in such a small, well designed camera is truly outstanding.|#|When taking sweep panorama's the coverage can vary depending on the speed with which the camera is moved. It takes a little getting used to. A simple traffic light system to indicate the correct sweep rate would be an useful future capability viz. Green - OK; Amber - Too Slow; Red - Too Fast.
9.0|#|Build quality, features and most of all: size!|#|Auto white balance is very bad. I have to reset it most of my pictures in Lightroom or etc.
9.0|#|I'm using firmware version 3 and I really like the custom buttons, however I would have liked a 4th option to actually use in camera. I have button C set up for manual focus assist, button B for ISO, White balance and metering. This is where I would like the fourth option where I would use Creative style. The actual feel of the camera is solid and one of quality. Image quality is really good, much better than the compact cameras and the Panasonic G1 I've been using. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase.|#|

9.0|#|Firmware update has been a boon. Image quality very good.|#|Flash is not powerful enough and no alternative/upgrade.  Camera case is too expensive at over 20% of the cost of the camera.
9.0|#|I love the build and small body. It feels good to hold and comfortable in my small hands. I was suprised I could manage so well without a view finder. This is probably because the viewing screen is exceptionally clear and large. Being a small person i like it's lightness, it is so much lighter to carry distances than my Alpha yet I can still use the lens I bought for the Alpha. I easily got used to using the wheel to drive the controles.|#|Worst bit is it frequently fails to recognise the memory card and I have to reformat the card and lose pictures. I have tried a 'cheap' SD card plus a same brand as the camera memory stick pro with the same results.
8.0|#|Easy to use. Great photos. Perfect half way house between compact and DSLR. May not fit into your pocket but will fit into your bag!|#|A bit unresponsive when flash required.

The HX5V does this brilliantly - and I miss it (I upgraded from the HX5 to the NEX5)

10.0|#|Fantastic colour quality, and some of my macro shots look simply outstanding even though I have yet to purchase the Macro Lens upgrade! I also used this camera to take photos for a promotional artwork banner (Theatrical Advertisement) that was taller than me and the image quality never let me down. Full HD Recording is a brilliant addition and 3D Panoramic photos are a wonderful oddity that I use every now and then.|#|My only gripes with this camera, and they are small compared to my praise, is that the panoramic shots fail to pick out such brilliant depth of colour and image quality as stills and that the 3D photographs are limited to panoramic only. WhileI realise that a single lens camera must take multiple photos to interpret 3D on a still, maybe a system similar to how the 3D Panoramic system can work but with less sweeping motions ust to give the singular still the 3D definition. Maybe a smaller pan where you make sure the middle of the photo is where the subject is? The camera can then interpret this asa single 3D stills photo and not a panoramic.

9.0|#|In camera anti shake REALLY WORKS. It is great and means I can get shots that I would otherwise miss. + this is with fantastic 'old' minolta glass such as the 50mm f1.7 prime. I like the lack of too many push buttons and much prefer the slightly 'old school' 2 dials. LCD is very clear and easy to understand. Feels quite solid. Battery life fantastic. No dust after many lens changes - for me the anti dust works or I have been lucky. Wireless flash very good. Kit lens is pretty good compared to others.|#|The flash connection is non standard but is actually better than the one everyone else uses as flashgun is locked on. Easily solved with an adapter or suitable old minolta cable if flash off camera.

9.0|#|The camera is very easy to use and produces sharp good quality images.

I need a wider angle lens to replace my Minolta AF50 but  I am told that the Sony lens normally offered WITH the A 100 body is not up to the Minolta standard (but of this I have no experience)!|#|None found to date.
10.0|#|Takes excellent photos and is easy to setup and use.  I haven't had an out of focus or camera shake picture yet including 'low light level' shots.  The hand grip is comfortable and the balance of the camera is first-class.|#|It's a little heavier than some other cameras.

9.0|#|This camera was bought as an upgrade from my old SLR Minolta so the design is familiar and there is the added bonus of compatable lenses. It's beautifully balanced, easy to use and has great battery life. Go buy one !|#|The only 'bad' point I can come up with is that the sony lens isn't power zoom.
8.0|#|At the time the Sony was a reasonably priced budget DSLR. Its is comfortable to handle and the camera body feels solid. The autofocusing system and light meter respond very quickly. The controls and on-screen menu system are very easy to navigate and did not take me long to get used to. The supplied sotware is also useful including a RAW converter and photo organiser.|#|The only draw back appears to be the quality of the kit lenses (18-70mm and the 75-300mm zoom). Although, generally speaking, the auto-focusing system performs well the images are not quite as sharp as I would have hoped. This, I understand can be improved by using a third party lense such as the Sigma branded lenses. Since my purchase the prices of the Canon 400D and the Nikon D40x kits have come down bringing the two major brands, and if you believe everything you read, superior cameras closer to the Sony kit's price point.

The camera itself is solid, sturdy and feels very comfortable in your hands.|#|The point and click features of the camera perform poorly in bad lighting or at night. I will need to experiment with bespoke features in order to compensate for this. However, I assume that this is more of an issue of my inexperience rather than the camera.
9.0|#|Price and is very easy to use with some good short cuts to change the shooting settings.|#|But for the price of the camera and lens well worth it.
9.0|#|in the hand. Great image quality.|#|But these are just small niggles, and I love the A200, the Pros far outweigh the Cons, and for the price you won't find a better camera.
9.0|#|There are many features on this camera which you would also find on more expesive cameras.|#|No major bad points .... bit more explaination on some of the functions in the manual as, if like me, you have never owned or used an SLR before.
9.0|#|Allows even me to take a good photograph.|#|Advised that the lens attachment system was compatible with my old 'Minolta' lenses so i could use them even though some of the features (auto focus/apperture) would not be available.  Its not.
9.0|#|Easy to use straight from the box.|#|None so far!
10.0|#|too many to list|#|When you have the supplied lens hood on it makes moon shaped shadows on the bottom of the pictures, i.e it gets in the way of the flash
10.0|#|After reading several reviews of this camera and other makes of cameras in the same price range, I decided to buy the A200 as it offered the best value for money, I definitely was not disappointed. It looks and feels great and as a new SLR user I have found this camera is easy to get started with and take some really good pictures. My husband is a more experienced photographer, but used to an analogue SLR, I think he has now been converted to using digital by this camera. I would definitely recomend the A200!|#|None found yet.
9.0|#|Ease of use, compatibitity with our Minolta lenses, very good menu options with 'simple' menu excellent for quick adjustments and the 'Programme' mode easily accessible for alternative special requirements (spot metering and spot focus, continuous and bracket shooting etc).|#|Have not found any really bad points yet!
9.0|#|Easy to use menu system.|#|Shutter is noisey.
9.0|#|judging that you are afterall getting a Sony product with all the associated positive reputation of this company, this camera is definitely worth it!!!!|#|Would have been nice to have a 'live view' feature, but considering that this would've probably bumped up the price considerably, it's not too much of a big deal.
9.0|#|Balance,weight and build quality.|#|Takes a bit of understanding the small manual,I found it best to download the PDF version and use the pc as my manual!
8.0|#|Easy to use for anyone wanting to get into photography|#|Not that many features - but its cheep!
9.0|#|Ease of use,it could not be simpler.Also I owned Minolta 7000AF and the range of lenses can now be used with this camera which is great because being on a limited budget I have now got the best of both worlds.|#|If anything it's a little on the heavy side but it's not really an issue
8.0|#|Good picture quality, the manual is informative however the camera is pretty straight forward to use - even for a novice like me. Easily put together.|#|My own fault really but you have to look through the view finder to take the picture - having previously been able to use the screen.
10.0|#|good balanced camera that feels nice in my big hands|#|none

9.0|#|Ease of use, quality of results|#|Can't think of any
9.0|#|For the price this is an excellent Camera. Basically you are getting an upgraded Konica Minolta with a Sony badge with some very nice features like the anti-shake system. All old Konika-minolta lenses fit. For the Price it is very good value - purely based on the fact that you get all the latest features like anti shake in the body rather then having to replace all your old lenses. Perfect for entering in to the world of digital SLR.|#|None really for the price. My only negative view is that some of the new Sony lenses are more expensive then the Nikkon / Canon equivalent but, with the large push Sony is having on its SLR range, I am sure these prices will drop over time.
9.0|#|Being a novice at these camera's the instructions have been very easy to follow so far.  For a first time SLR user I am very impressed.|#|None so far
10.0|#|Excellent results when taking pictures racing cars at Donnington...A1|#|All plastic and view finder only for taking picture
9.0|#|Still need to read and read read the instructions to get the best out of it. Don't expect a basic set of features.|#|Complex feature set at first and fairly uninformative instructions. You need to really play with it to understand well.
9.0|#|An ideal starter DSLR which ticks all of the boxes. Since purchase its been awarded best buy a number of times in different magazines. Out of the box its easy to use, and has good battery life. The standard lense is a good effort and works well for out and about. Additionally it has good compatability with older konica/minolta lenses.|#|As ever, batteries are great but expensive to replace/buy a spare on.  Uses compact flash which is effective but not as cheap CD
10.0|#|Ease of use, value for money. A good beginners DSLR, or for someone who wants the DSLR functionality at a reasonable price.|#|None really, if you understand what you're buying. You can get more functionality and better lenses on other cameras, but at what cost?
9.0|#|Almost everything.|#|Flash is active by default, which is kind of annoying sometimes.
8.0|#|Easy to pick up and use|#|Could do with a cut down manual to carry with you to start off

10.0|#|Great first DSLR, very easy to use, clear instructions. I upgraded to the A300 for the live view|#|cant think of any
10.0|#|Good auto focus, great 'noise' control at high ISO, bargain price, easy to use, 'long' zoom of kit lens, good picture quality, handles exposure very well|#|Noisy shutter release, flash doesn't raise high enough so if using the lens hood at wide angle the hood will cause shadows. Software supplied
10.0|#|Easy to use, Just click on Auto and click away until you get confident with changed and tweaking the settings!|#|None so far

10.0|#|Excellent choice for a first digital SLR camera.  good features but simple to use|#|Haven't found any yet!
9.0|#|Easy to use and I find the camera easy to hold while taking photographs.I have not used it a lot due to not being able to travel for the moment but recently took some shots inside a poorly lit church without flash and they came out very well.Also having the settings on top for different features (e.g.micro)handy as my other camera I have to go into menu.The colours are coming out very good and life like being a keen gardener this is important to me.Considering it's size I don't find it a heavy camera to use.|#|Not found any as yet but I am only a novice.One small item would help having a cord on the lens cap as it is easy to lose when in use.

10.0|#|Excellent for beginners|#|
10.0|#|The camera represents extremely good value especially if you have minolta mount lenses from an old SLR. The Dynax lenses worked well with the Sony body. I compared this to the alpha 100, which got good reviews when it was released where it was compared against expensive Nikons. The 200 only differs from the 100 by not having a lense stop down, and mirror lockup, but gains 3200 iso and faster (2.7 fps) continous shoot. The 200 is described as budget now but is basically the same as the 100. The Sony 200 has CCD steady shot feature which is better that peer models by other manufacturers. The 200 uses the same basic body as the top flight 700. The tiltable viewing screen on the rest of the more epensive range was not appealing to me, hence represented an expensive option and means the optical view finders is smaller.|#|The Bionz ehgine is recognised as overcompensating which smoothing high ISO grain. The View finder is close to the body for people with glasses. The lense focus ring feels loose. The card door has to be open to use the mini USB, why not mount externally. The eyecup cover is hard to remove.

9.0|#|Well built, easy to use, good images|#|The shutter button being behind the adjustment wheel threw me at first.  It is not so easy to find as if it were in front of the adjustment wheel when the camera is to the eye.
8.0|#|Great introduction DSLR camera, very good value|#|Not as many features as some high end models
9.0|#|Lovely 'feel' to the camera, it feels solid and sits in the hand well. Easy to use, and very pleased with the results it produces.|#|
9.0|#|It has, especially for the price, a whole lot of features, like anti-shake, sensor cleaning etc.which is usually available on more costly, upmarket models. The menu is very easy to understand and use. Image quality is very good, just short of my Nikon lens output which is superb.|#|None really.

9.0|#|The body of the camera really fits my hand comfortably and I can reach all of the nessesery functions quite easily. I love the multiple option display it really helps with getting to grabs with learning how to go 'manual' and take those fantastic photos again and again and again.|#|The RAW data transfer time could have been speeded up but that has been updated and seen to with the newer models that have come recently.
8.0|#|amazing image quality.after years of using general digital cameras the move to the sony a200 has changed the way we control taking pictures.|#|manual focus needs resetting from auto back to manual to work each time camera is turned off.mthats the mai gripe
10.0|#|Its a dream to use - having always been a 35mm person this is my first digital camera and I can say i am finally convinced.  Its so good my dad is getting one who is a semi pro.  cant rate it highly enough.  The only down side is the not clear instructions regarding the card you need for storage. Other than that its as I say a dream!|#|

7.0|#||#|The main bad point has been with the lens. It failed after fifteen months due to a fault with the auto focus mechanism. Examination on the internet shows this to be a very common problem so I could not recommend this make of camera to a friend. I expect a purchase of this magnitude to last longer than fifteen months.
9.0|#|It is light and easy to use , the only down fall is having to use the view finder all the time as it doesnt have the on screen function as on the bigger models.|#|
10.0|#|camera by using auto settings. If you find that a particular picture does not look how you expected it to then a few minutes reading the manual tends to provide the answer. Seems to me that the ability of the camera is only restricted by th requirement of specific lenses for certain shots. All in all a very good buy.|#|Honestly I can't think of a bad point. I'm sure that people with more knowledge in the field can find faults but at my level I'm very happy with the improvement in my photography with this camera.

8.0|#|I think overall the camera is a great little buy and would certainly recommend it for a first DSLR. Cost wise it is value for money and fairly straight forward to use. There are many features that make it as good as more 'quality' cameras and it can deliver some good results. I take many photos and find I like about 2 out of every ten images, many are a surprise! The camera is reasonably light and the dials/menu are fairly easy to use.|#|I would have liked to see my actual images on the screen as I took them and perhaps a greater range on the lens. Perhaps I am asking for too much, but sometimes shots can be disappointing, even at the right settings! I took plenty of shots over Christmas and thought my little 200k was doing well until I matched it up against a relatives Nikon D90 and the images with that were far superior. I was manually taking all my shots and my nephew was taking his auto 'snaps', getting much better results. Maybe getting an a200k will be self limiting, as in the end, I will have to get better lenses for it, or indeed another camera. The manual is a little bit dry, so I purchased a field guide book to help, more.

7.0|#||#|The main bad point has been with the lens. It failed after fifteen months due to a fault with the auto focus mechanism. Examination on the internet shows this to be a very common problem so I could not recommend this make of camera to a friend. I expect a purchase of this magnitude to last longer than fifteen months.

9.0|#|Image quality, ease of use, ergo, viewfinder, in-body stabilisation, responsiveness, build, partnership with Carl Zeiss|#|No magnification with Live Preview, cannot use mirror up with wireless remote, poor raw conversion software (needs a lot of improvement), lens lineup needs primes/long teles/speciality optics (preferably Carl Zeiss)
9.0|#|It's a compact full-frame SLR at a fair price. Build is perfect. Great ergonomics. Menus and controls are very intuitive. I bought it to use classic Minolta lenses like the 50/3.5 and 100/2, and image quality, in particular the colour, is incredible.  SteadyShot means I can use cheaper lenses at normal ISOs, handheld. Auto white balance is pretty good, especially with flash. Battery life is excellent. You don't need Zeiss lenses to get amazing pictures, just read reviews carefully and be prepared to fight on ebay for the best classic Minolta glass. I also like the Sigma 50/1.4 HSM on this camera. Sony wireless flash system is excellent, if pricey.|#|Autofocus points are too few and too closely grouped together. High ISO JPEGs are a bit noisy, but there are ways to beat that, i.e. expose to the right and pull back the highlights later. The camera does tend to underexpose anyway, probably to retain as much highlight detail as possible. With a big lens the rig can become heavy, so I use small primes.
9.0|#|image quality have been very good.|#|range of best quality lenses is expensive.
10.0|#|Very easy to use giving excellent results. I have found that the exposure requires less correction than on cameras . Although I have other Sony digital SLR cameras its only with the 900 that I have made a lot of use of DRO system, with excellent results. I liked the continued use of  CF cards .|#|No in camera flash
9.0|#|An accomplished package from Sony.|#|I don't have any negatives about the camera.
10.0|#|Very well made with an excellent viewfinder. Capable of superb results using the CZ or G lenses specially made for it. Not cheap but excellent value nonetheless.|#|Although the dedicated lenses are first class, the specialist lenses that are available for the 'big two' manufacturers' cameras are notable for their absence.
7.0|#|24MP|#|No built-in flash
10.0|#|Feels great, and I can continue using same lenses I've has for years. Image clarity is fantastic, which means that I can crop a small part of the image and still produce a good-sized photo. The steady-shot feature is a definite plus, because I do produce hand-held panoramic images without any problems at all. The menu system is easy to use. The autofocus is quick, even on my speedy little dog! Overall, a great camera. My own level would be competent amateur, but I have done a few successful weddings.|#|I have done a few weddings at the local cathedral, where the natural light is diffused through stained glass. This looks lovely to the human eye, but it means that you have to 'up' the ISO a fair bit since 'the man' won't allow the use of flash. Grain is a little bit of an issue on the 900, so I tend to use the 700. Not much of a complaint though, just a nit pick, which I understand will be resolved in a future firmware release.
9.0|#|Dynamic Range optimiser. Fantastic resolution,anti-shake built into the body, best resolution LCD, 100% view finder|#|Doesn't automatically switch memory cards when one is full. No onboard flash for those odd occasions, a little noisey at high ISO, rip-off price of top flash gun and screen protector and vertical grip.
9.0|#|easy to use, not to heavy, all contols are easy to access and you can change settings quickly|#|none so far
10.0|#|This is a great camera.|#|Finally, please bring out a 35mm F2.0, it would sell like hot cakes. (And more Zeiss primes please).
10.0|#|Intuitive control layout, solid build, my 2nd 900 and I would buy a third in a heartbeat.|#|Need's faster AF, I use primarily for motorsports and find the focusing lacking in speed compared to the opposition, more FF lenses needed to get anywhere near C*N*N
9.0|#|build quality!|#|would love more zeiss ,or sony high quality lenses,brither lenses-1.2f ;1.4f with ssm!!
10.0|#|great value for money compared to other brands|#|noise control compared to other brands
10.0|#|This is a tremendous camera.  I always used to shoot Minolta but went to Nikon with digital as I couldn't afford the KM 7D then I got the D300 rather than the Sony a700, but when I went full frame I switched back and this is a massive improvement for the money.  THe nikon equivalent would have cost more for just the body than my whole kit did!|#|Inconveniences are that the matrix metering is not as good and the autofocus does not have the same kind of coverage or control as Nikons do but I knew that before switching!
9.0|#|I'm so very glad that Sony have taken up the yoke of my beloved Minolta.|#|A bit on the heavy side (not as much as Olympus) but still it could be lighter. The Instruction book could be a bit more specific over certain features 'like wireless flash' which I personally found a bit vague.
10.0|#||#|No built in flash
8.0|#||#|It should come with some live view software for use when shooting tethered to a laptop/computer etc
10.0|#|It's very solid body and can be handled roughly. Wide range of extreme lenses with durability without the need to repair you can work with it for years.|#|Should have had a movie option as well as live view. If possible they should give the HDR option like 550
10.0|#|Outstanding for studio work.|#|Retains the rather perverse Minolta flash shoe.
8.0|#|Image quality is outstanding, very well built with good dust and water seals|#|Expensive and not fully compatable with all Minolta accessories, particularly the 1200AF Macro-Flash. No Sony equivalent to the Minolta MFC-1000 available
9.0|#|many useful  features and customizable|#|The contrast between sun and shade was harsh and had to be adjusted, but that maybe because i am not yet fully familiar with the controls.
9.0|#|Excellent ease of functionallity and quick settings alteration|#|Noise problems at high ISO settings hopefully to be addressed with firmware upgrade.
8.0|#||#|The vertical grip is a design disaster.
10.0|#|Incredibly robust.  Exposed to extremes of Antarctica in blizzard and -22 degrees with no problems whatsoever. Batteries proved to have a long life.  Not tested in real sea conditions (ie getting in and out of Zodiacs etc) but no problems with sea spray on deck.  Blown over twice on tripod and survived.  Sits well in hand and being familiar with the Dynax range buttons familiar and easy to operate.  The Qucknavi screen is very useful.  Bright view finder and LCD but the latter, as with most cameras, is difficult to se in very bright light.  A separate LCD shield or viewer should be included as standard kit.|#|The preview button is extremely awkward to use, position not conducive to using very quickly, especially when hand held - would be much better on top of camera or built in to hand grip.  Full frame RAW obviously uses memory like no tomorrow so users need plenty of storage space or in field editing capability.  Sensor seems very prone to collecting dust, which on full frame is clearly more visible.  Sony could do with their own cleaning kit.

10.0|#|I absolute love it! Sometimes because it is so good i'm scared of using it! It's such a friend! I need more time to evaluate it though, but suffice it to say, I entered some photos taken with it in my Camera Club projected image competition and I am curently joint 3rd. I've never entered such a competition before so I am over the moon with it. I have the Zeiss 24-70 and sony g 70-400 and i love them, they are brilliant. I also have the 500mm reflex but i have had few opportunitites to use that so far. I wanted a product where the manufacturer was committed to it. I tried it with Pentax and the manufacturers-who stated much the same as Sony that it wanted to be the third after the big 2 failed to reqalise it. I was really disappointed and lost all faith in pentax. Then sony came along with the same claim, and actually, i believe you more than pentax. Put your money where your mouth is and produce a 10/12/-20/24mm wide zoom as at the minute Sigma has my money. The images are brilliant, the 24 mp sensor is fabulous-to a degree.|#|It does have some bad points but these do NOT outweigh the camera at present. There isnt a high quality 10/12-20/24mm wide angle zoom-this is really bad of you, as you do not have a full focus range covered. The noise on higher ISO isnt as good as Nikon or Canon-you need to improve here fast ( I used to be a Canon owner), and the camera plus lenses are heavy-could do with a rucksac where there are wheels on it that can be deployed where necessary. I dont mind the heaviness to some degree-bizarre as it might sound being in the menopause carting such heavy stuff might actually fend off osteoporosis! Also it isnt as intuitive-where handling is concerned as the Canon 5D11. Yes I compared both before I made a decision and the ergonomics on the canon is a little better than the sony, but the noise issue does let you down. You need to sort out the focal range of your zooms and the noise issue. I;'d like to see HDR on it too, not bothered about face or smile detection and I still dont understand the preview thing. Why cant the camera keep the image it presents you with if you like it? Also, get some GPS on board. As a female photographer I often feel vulnerable in the wilds, or in town, with £400 kit with me. I would like to see a tracker put on board and a button inderneath the camera that i can press as a panic button sending current information on my wherabouts with my latest picture to someone i trust by text or email. its a security feature I thought about earlier this century and i think panasonic have logged on to that. so some kind of security for female photographers cannot be all bad and the tracker could trace the camera's whereabouts if it is stolen.

For example, a 35mm would be nice - the older Minolta 35/f2 is very expensive on the used market. I would rather buy a new Sony 35mm, but it is not available.

9.0|#|I would without hessitation recommend this camera, it is good value, easy to use and produces very good results.  Well done Sony!|#|None to date, does all I need with no fuss.
10.0|#||#|well for an entry level dslr there are not many faults with this camera at all although a moveable back screen like on the a550 would have been a nice feature
9.0|#|light and easy to handle, I am a novice to SLR cameras but am gradually finding my way around the features. The lenses are easy to change and I am thrilleed with the results I obtain and the range of accessories available. It is also great that I could upgrade the camera body and all my lenses I have purchased would still fit.|#|The screen is fixed at the back unlike the newer model my friend purchased as he can angle it, a useful feature if your in a tight spot or shooting at ground level. The only bad point is I need to learn more about my camera so its the user not the Sony and also you need the RAW convertor specific to Sony as I couldnt view them at my evening class whereas the Nikon and Canon users could access the class software.
9.0|#|Ease of use.  Excellent pictures with the built-in flash.  Lens performs really well in wide apertures, with focus good at edges.|#|Framing picture is slightly to the left.  Thus TTL is ot 100% accurate.
8.0|#|Wonderful value has the feel of a real camera.  Raw files particularly good worth a better lens than the on I have got.  Handles very well.|#|Deserves a better lens than the one supplied with the basic camera.  Perhaps a little clumsy but easy to hild steady in horizontal position not so good vertically.

10.0|#|As with all Sony products, they are not the cheapest by far, however, you get a quality item which should last for many years of use.|#|I really did appreciate your on line tutorial of some months ago and encouraged me to take the camera off auto settings!!
9.0|#|Once you are used to the features it is quick to change between them. The camera often produces  stunning   pictures  without  them  needing  any additional work. It  is comfortable  in  the hand. In full  auto mode you  can just point and shoot.|#|None really.
10.0|#|good quality at a budget price|#|cant find any
8.0|#|If you take time to study the camera functions and follow the manual you will be rewarded with excellent results.|#|I detest reading manuals but it is essential an investment is made in reading the manual to obtain the best results.
10.0|#|excellent entry level camera, but also ideal for the experienced, it cerainly provides all the necessary features you need. Very happy with my purchase.|#|
7.0|#|I have no problems with it except as below.|#|I bought this camera as my first DSLR, overall I love it BUT as my main interest is wildlife so therefore quietness is a must, this camera is so clunky and noisy, compared to my friends Canon, when I try to take a picture any birds nearby take flight or drop down dead from the noise :-)
9.0|#|A good DSLR well worth it money and easy to use!|#|The bad thing about it is the hot shoe flash as its not a standard design so you have to buy an adaptor for studio flashes etc otherwise fine camera.
8.0|#|A good all round peace of equipment for amateur and professional, easy to operate, you get clear, precises, images. The one thing I would also have included would be an ability to use the screen as a view finder, but this must be switchable, view finder/screen vise-visa.  What more can I say almost perfect.|#|as said above just the screen option.

8.0|#|Great price.  Reasonable build.  Pictures are great for the money as is the supplied lens.|#|Sony DSLR-A200 has its limitations and will be looking for a camera with a bigger sensor, HD video and more pixels next time.  I made the conscious choice not to buy these features this time round.
9.0|#|I think you should provide  a combined usb connection /power source/ charger as standard. the present system means extra items to buy, store and connect.|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use functions even for a novice like myself. Great images as an outcome.|#|Not having the greatest of knowledge of SLR's i have not come across any bad points of this camera.
9.0|#|the a200 is very good dslr camera for the keen amature.it is easy to handle.|#|no live view on screen
10.0|#|nice to hold easy to use + my Minolta lens's fit|#|no double exposure feature
8.0|#|The Sony-a200 is overall an amazing product would recommend it to anyone who wants to take photography to the next level. It is easy to use, easy to understand and most importantly its very comfortable to use, something I was very sceptical about before buying the camera. The camera is very light unlike some of the heavy duty professional cameras you see out there.|#|Of course this is not thoroughly for professional use, but the camera had room for more improvements for the same price range. After all the camera is aimed at amateurs some features could be replaced by others such as being 10.2 MP to 12.1 MP
9.0|#|The camera is a nice weight and feels good in the hands. It's feature rich, but you can start taking great photographs more or less straight away - while you get used to the more advanced capabilities in time. Seems to be a great build quality, as you;d expect of a Sony product.|#|Sometimes I feel that navigating around the camera settings and features doesn't feel quite as intuitive as it might have been and I've had to remind myself how to change a particular setting by refferring back to the instruction booklet a little more often than I'd like to.
9.0|#|easy to handle, sturdy|#|none as i can see in the time i have used it.
8.0|#|My first DSLR, great camera easy to use, fast AF, with good overall results|#|Burst shooting a little slow for certain action shots
10.0|#|It is easy to use, i'm an amateur and new to digital photography, yet i'm consistently getting better and better pictures, to the point i have a buyer for any pictures i take at rally's. It does everything i want and a lot more. The feel of it the weight and the solid feel of it's construction were what prompted me to choose it over the likes of Nikkon and Cannon which were the other two products i looked at. Furthermore Sony are a brand I have consistently chosen over other brands for the past 15/16 years since i bought my first Sony Walkman. Our TV, Blu-Ray, PS2+PS3 and Waio lap-top are all examples of how i rate Sony as being THE top brand to have.|#|I haven't found anything that i could class as a bad point. From my point of view (and i am a very particular and fussy person) it is a truly first class product.
9.0|#|very easy to use for first time dslr users|#|

10.0|#|i only needed to read the manual once, it that simple to use and change the lens|#|price of the lens
8.0|#|Very flexible in the White balance preset.|#|
9.0|#|Its very easy to use as a novice. Lenses are common and I have managed to purchase a couple of good second hand lenses.  The anti-shake feature built into the body instead of each individual lens is perfect for a begginer, and makes lenses more affordable.|#|None that I can think of. It's still a complicated camera for a novice, but its the other stuff you need to learn to get the best shots, so the settings that you have to try to remember is the down side. However this will all come with practice.
9.0|#|Image quality great easy to use once you have mastered the way the camera works. Camera is light but felt robust in use. All round the best camera I had bought. Recommend to anyone starting in Digital photography or like me returning to SLR from video|#|Camera shutter button not in best place not a natural extention for the finger.

10.0|#|THANK YOU|#|none yet found after  6 months
9.0|#|A cheap DSLR that is comfortable to use, it is my first DSLR and I like it. The A200 only is 10 M pixels but this is fine for my wild life photo's which I use the 75 to 300 mm lens a lot. The buttons are easy to get my fingers to without having to look. You need a book to help you get around the A200|#|you can't use the screen to preview the scene.

9.0|#|Easy to use and connect to a P_C to donload pictures. Clarity of pics excllent and auto focusing is great.|#|The instructions can be a bit daunting for people like myself who has just started and is unable to undertand the technical jargon. But the camera itself has no bad point to date.
9.0|#|There is no delay in the shutter activation which I found so frustrating on my previous camera. I would like to purchase further lenes but at the moment cannot afford.|#|The only slight downside is the weight, but the quality build 'out weighs' this. You can't have everything!
8.0|#|steady shot|#|the lense cover is not atached to anything so is easy to loose
10.0|#|good for an entry level user - there's a lot of buttons but you can use the automatic settings until you learn what all the other bits do.|#|None that I've found so far
8.0|#|Easy to use basic functions and the picture quality is really good.  The other functions take some getting used to but the instruction manual covers everything if you are inclined to learn about some of the less basic functions.  For the amateur photographer, I thought this camera was perfect.|#|Neck strap is too hard - it cuts into your neck at the back.
7.0|#|go. It's easy to use, the picture quality is good for the price and it appears quite sturdy.|#|
6.0|#|easy to use|#|chunky, delay in taking photo after depressing the button, smaller storage card - non standard, not helpful
8.0|#|Very simple to use right from the start.|#|Pity it doesn't come with a card so you wouldn't have to purchase one.
8.0|#||#|it would be better if it had a rechargeable battery pack and not ordinary batteries
10.0|#|The menu's are easily accessable, and pretty much idiot proof, the pop up explanations/ballons are good and informative, no confusing techno-babble.  the auto functions are there to help you get the most out of the scene, especially in Portrait mode - I have taken some excellent portraits with this camera, where I would have had to have have wasted time setting up shots, the LCD pointed out a good selection of focus points, which helps reduce flare and white outs, on the finished image due to the various lighting conditions (including a party in a club - flashing lights and strobes were no problem), in fact the result was truly outstanding when printed, on that occassion, better than the paid photographers efforts.  The manual options are easily accessable, and work well if you know a lot about cameras and settings. The 10.1 mega-pixel facility is excellent if you do not want to bigger than A4 prints, even then the quality of the printed image is very, very good, especially on glossy or matt photo paper.  Video quality is reasonable, but i would not base a whole production on this unit. Ok for short holiday sequences, stablising is efficient, and very noticed if stabilising is switched off.|#|Because I have a large demand for my work, the battery life on this camera is important, especially for those opportunistic photos you see in the spur of the moment, the odd things that pop up, and you're going to want proof for your friends that you actually saw the item you're describing. That wacky road sign, or scene the usual sillies everyday life throws at your at the oddest of moments - So the battery life is good for about 300 or so flash filled, motion-stabilised, auto-focussed images at the higher resolutions - approx 1/2 Hr video, on a decent sized memory chip. That is really the only problem I have with this set up.

10.0|#|It's a very light, compact little camera, that's very easy to use and understand it's many functions.  It can easily challenge the bigger, more expensive camera manufacturers with its picture quality and affordable price.  For those of you who aren't pc literate; don't worry, as it's as easy as 1, 2, 3 when transfering your pictures from the Sony DSC -S930 to your computer.  I'd recommend it to any budding amateur photographer, like myself.|#|To be honest, I haven't come across any problems and can't think of any bad points to do with this camera.
8.0|#|large display, face recognision, good price.Excellent video picture (shame no zoom when videoing)|#|reviewing last photo taken requires manually switching from 'camera' to 'picture' mode (and then back again to take next photo), older sony model would automatically switch back from reviewing last photo to camera mode when 'shoot' button pressed. Deleting individual photos takes longer (more steps) than older one. Exposed usb port could get dirt in it (no plastic cover.

7.0|#||#|In short, not a very successful purchase.
8.0|#|Tremendous value for money all things considered|#|Resetting the frame counter and changing some functions is not intuitive.  Battery runs down very quickly cant take the camera out on its own and use it all day ~ second battery is prohibitively expensive when compared to the cameras cost).  Sports function would be nice for tracking the kids as they run around (in this mode a quicker shutter release would be good).
9.0|#|Great image quality, small size and good screen to review images.  Good lens cover that closes on shut down.  Lots of features built into the camera for image manipulation.  Good flash range.|#|In the 'easy' mode, the image stabilsation is turned off, this surely is what easy mode is for?  Cannot use ordinary sized batteries, so buy an (expensive) spare.

Alot of the items on the camera are somewhat beyond me - this is not a bad point and not doubt I will find out what they all mean and do eventually!

8.0|#|Very easy to use|#|User manual not very comprehensive
4.0|#|The function wheel is more protected than on the DSC-W50 which was easy to knock round accidentally.|#|Compared our previous DSC-W50 the image quality is poor particularly in low light conditions.The 12 mega pixel setting is only useable in very bright conditions and even then the results are fuzzy. The flush shutter release is not easy to locate by feel and tends to result in moving the camera as you try to squeeze it.
9.0|#|good basic point and shoot|#|no viewfinder
9.0|#|Always at the ready to take stunning photos. Lightness of weight and small enough to put in your pocket.|#|Battery length of power could be better. Quite expensive to buy spare one and other accessories.

8.0|#|image quality is really good, and there are a lot of fun features. it's also really easy to get the photos from the camera to a computer to organise and share them :)|#|some of the menus are a little confusing, and most people using it for the first time have trouble working out if the flash is on or off.
9.0|#|The live view is extremely useful, especially when taking low level shots. I also like the percentage battery indicator and the eye start focusing.|#|None.
9.0|#|as an old minolta user I had a good stock of lenses ect, the live view at any angle is very good and shows any compensation you make, The quality of imags raw or jpeg are are better than a cannon I used earlyer this year to try out and I am glad I waited.|#|the only thing I miss from my minolta 7D is the depth of field button and the AE lock button but you soon get round this.
9.0|#|Excellent features and performance|#|A little bit plasticky
10.0|#|I can have the camera up and running quickly, so i don't miss any good shots even before i got used to it, I also suffer with tremors a medical condition that is exagerated by extremes ie cold, heat , stress and concentration, sometimes i shake very badly when using a camera, after seeing the perfect picture results i actualy cried, it's feels wonderfull to use a camera again.|#|sometimes the flash pops up when not neccesary , creating too much expossure.

10.0|#|A joy to use - a phootgrapher's camera|#|I cannot think of any at the moment.
9.0|#|Very easy to use in auto mode, but well worthwhile investing in a book to help with some of the features in manual mode. RAW image is great allowing you to do so much more once the images are transferred to a computer.|#|Does not come with a flashcard.
9.0|#|Produces very good images and is quite straight forward to use, got this at slightly reduced price they were upgrading the range.|#|The decent lenses are quite expensive and seems to be less choice than Canon or Nikon.

9.0|#|Easy to take good photographs|#|Focus point can be confusing for casual users
6.0|#|Great product with loads of features that I've yet to become familiar with. Coupled with a Tamron 70/300 it gives awesome results with 'Point and Shoot' technique.|#|The User Manual wrongly assumes that the owner is either a  gifted amateur or a professional photographer. This is my first SLR after years of 'point and shoot' compact digital cameras and the explanations in the guide is way over my 'knowledge' level and the many features of the A350 are wasted on me.  I could probably turn my hand to nuclear fision more easily!
9.0|#|Nice to handle, easy to use - fantastic image quality|#|Lens are expensive
9.0|#|A great camera with loads of accessories, priced about right and easy to use...the ability to move the screen is an excellent idea.|#|None

10.0|#|Very easy to use|#|Can't find any bad points
9.0|#|The Sony A350 is solidly built.  Live View is a useful option, but I seldom use it as the viewfinder is bright and accurate.  The combination of 14 megapixels and image stabilisation gives crisp images.  It sits comfortably in the hand.|#|Not really bad points, but the solid build means a weighty camera, especially if an external flash unit is added.  As with many digital cameras, the dynamic range compares quite poorly with film, so I shoot routinely in RAW + JPEG which allows pictures taken under difficult conditions to be rescued, but fills up the memory card rather quickly.

10.0|#|very goog to use|#|no bad points
9.0|#|I had a Sony a100 which I was pleased with but a decided to upgrade to the Sony a350 and I was very pleased I did. As an amateur I found the a350 was great on all of the point and shoot settings and the actual picture quality is stunning. But when I tried to use all of the other features to make my pictures ever better I found that it was much much easy to find, get to and use the manual settings. Lastly, each time I check out the other equivalent cameras, I am so glad I bought the Sony.|#|It is a little bigger that some other cameras, but as I wanted a professional looking camera with good build quality I am happy to put up with the size of the a350.

10.0|#|Excellent range of features, 14.2 mp sensor, well made, live view and tiltable screen, relatively inexpensive, customisable menu, no video (unneccessary complication).|#|Some controls a little bit fiddly, lenses to make the most of the sensor are extremely expensive.
10.0|#|Uses Minolta AF lenses Good resolution|#|No video facility
9.0|#|Software for RAW image correction gives you lots of control. Handshake device works well. Lens interchange is easy to do. Camera easy to hold when shooting. I like having the camera features directly available on a button, instead of via a menu. The exposure compoenation adjustment is easy to use in conjunction with the histogram.|#|Attachment for viewfinder blank when not in use is uncertain - you could easily lose it. Not sure how to save images by dated folders.
8.0|#|Quality of product|#|Not easy always to comprehend some of the features.  For example what does does the Access lamp do?
9.0|#|Auto is very good but has trouble focusing on subject, when there is an object nearer.|#|Flash is a bit erratic at times.
8.0|#|Good build quality|#|Can be a little bit complicated at first.
10.0|#|Delivers everything and more, and after a long time searching and reading reviews I bought the Alpha 350 as this offers exceptional value for money and I consider this camera to be more than an entry level camera and the equivalent would be twice the price.|#|None.
9.0|#|It has easy to use functionality and you can use it straight away with limited knowledge. Interesting enough to give you plenty to progress your photography. Sharp picture quality.|#|Have not found any as yet, but l am still an ameteur photographer, so l do not expect proffessional features.
8.0|#|Various advantages of DSLR|#|would prefer better and more thorough user guide
9.0|#|The tilting back screen is great while in live view, to be able to hold the camera at a low or high level and to be able to see what the camera sees is rearly rearly good.|#|There isn't a plug on the camera for external flash units, such as studio flash units.  I have had to buy a hotshoe adapter, but haven't used it yet so don't know if it works (bought it 2 days ago).

7.0|#|I think the camera is excellent and I have had some good pictures from it with some good effects but there is so much to learn about these cameras but I am being patient and want to learn more, but overall I love the camera and have so many pictures now to look back on.|#|The only downfall is that there needs to be more of an explanation within the manual when using the different features on it.

9.0|#|Excellent value for money for an amateur. You can flick it onto its 'auto' setting and get great pictures without understanding your ISO from your Aperture - or you can adjust all its settings to get a perfect shot.|#|
9.0|#|Camera is very easy to use and an excellent introduction to DSLR photography. Some really good features including the adjustable lcd makes it a real handy camera and i have passed it onto more 'professional' photographers who have been impressed by its performance.|#|None yet...
10.0|#|Easy to use and comfortable, not to heavy. Description given for all the settings on the camera that is very helpful. Live view and tilting screen very useful too. Very good beginner camera.|#|As a beginner to SLR photography I am unaware of any outstanding bad points, where as more experienced photographer would notice and compare to other makes.
9.0|#|I purchased this camera because it enabled me to use Minolta Lenses previously purchased with a Minolta Dynax. I must say that I consider the camera to be of excellent value.|#|To date I have not encountered any bad points.
9.0|#|Superb quality of pictures, easy to change lenses, user friendly, makes this amateur feel like a pro!|#|Buttons are a bit fiddly until you get used to them.
8.0|#|Image stabilisation in low light, although this doesn't always provide perfectly sharp results, and your subject has to keep still. You can fix noise to a certain extent but those in the know will be able to spot what you've done :-(|#|Image noise at even 400 ISO, meaning only 100-200 can be used if you intend to blow-up your photos. Canon cameras are much better in this regard. The supplied lens is pretty rubbish if you demand truly sharp images, although all lenses given away with cameras tend to be like this, and I may have expectations that are too high. Also, the flash mount isn't compatible with standard flash guns.

It produces great images and tilting LCD is something we would not be without.|#|We have just had a baby and are finding it very difficult to adjust the flash so that the image quality is great without the flash being so bright it's damaging to our baby. Having our hands full makes it difficult to go through the large book of instructions to find exactly how to remedy this.

10.0|#|Excellent for starters into Digital photography|#|Original batteries way overpriced otherwise I really cannot fault this camera.
7.0|#|Can have alternatives for accessories instead of genuine.|#|View finder including live view has developed a fault. The picture is out from top and left so you do not capture what you see. Took it to a well known camera retailer and they said sorry this is going to be a Manufactorer repair, contacted Manufacturer and they have ignored me and not returned any of my correspondence.

9.0|#|Quality is excellent. It has been said that the grip is not too comfy: I have no problem with it at all. it feels solid and well made and the weight isn't that noticeable when being carried for any time. The 18-55 lens is brilliant and being a Minolta owner, my other lenses fit and work OK.|#|I bouhgt a fitment so as to use my Vivitar flash with this camera. It does not work! It is a pity that the camera doesn't have a connection for a flash lead for non-Sony flash guns. the only way around this is to have a remote sensor to fire the third-party flash.

9.0|#|For many years I was a keen amateur also using my skills in a semi professional capacity with the NHS Ambulance Service. On retirement in 2000 other commitments and interests resulted in my disposing of all photographic equipment and purchasing a small digital camera for personal use, predominantly grandchildren. Over the years I replaced that camera twice, both pocket size, the last being a Sony Cyber shot, only very occasionally experiencing an urge for something better. A friend purchased a 380 and sought my advice. As soon as I handled it that camera felt right in my hands. It was the first and only DSLR I have handled and have no regrets. The quality and handling is first class. I have no experience of any other DSLR so value for mony is a guess.|#|None
10.0|#|but not with the a380. I have learned so much from the camera about the all the settings. I have bought the Sony 50mm SAM f1.8 lens and have at last got some decent pictures of my cat without having to use flash. I also bought a Sigma 55-200mm lens and have also started to use an old Pentacon M42 thread lens with an AF confirm adapter.  It is great fun.|#|I have only found one fault and that is the battery does not seem to last a long time.
10.0|#|Everything about this camera is superb, from it's ease of use to it's lightness in weight, together with excellent results.|#|Some accessories are not easy to aquire and need quite a bit of searching to obtain.

Lack of video mode surprising for a company with such experience in the video recoring market although this really shouldnt be a problem.

10.0|#|If you want a camera and not a toy, go for the Sony A230 , it's a dream machine.|#|
10.0|#|Comparatively lightweight for such a well made camera, it has exceptional ease of use, having a more intuitive than manual driven learning process.  Amazing value for money, offering both an outstanding point and click and shutter and aperture priority and other facilities for the more serious photgrapher.  It includes an invaluable built-in guidance on shutter speed, aperture and depth of focus relationships, ideal for the enthusiast moving up from a compact camera.  The absence of a live screen is no disadvantage for me as I have previously found it difficult to use a screen in bright weather and, with my eyesight, I find it easier to use a view finder.  The range of use can, of course, be expanded with the use of the optional additional lenses.  However, the supplied lens is certainly more than adequate for all normal usage.|#|Not so much a bad point, simply a reminder that the automatic/manual focus controls can be moved, accidentally.  However, the absence of the usual red illuminated spots in the focus sensor area lets you know this.
10.0|#|As a complete amateur I've found that this is an excellent first time camera.  Using the profiles, you can basically just point and click, however there's also a manual option, which will appeal to those that have a bit more camera experience.  The quality of the photos is excellent, which I've tried in a variety of light.  It's managed to perfectly capture some stunning sunsets, completely maintaining the depth of the colours.|#|I had to order a memory card separately.  I thought for the money that was spent, that I would at least get a memory card, even if it was small.
8.0|#|The camera is easy to use, autofocus is accurate, reproduction of colours with sony lenses is pleasant. The menus are easy to navigate and the whole thing feels well made. Image quality is exellent for the price and the inbuilt stabilisation has allowed me to get shots which would have been impossible otherwise.|#|Uses the inbuilt flash as an autofocus assist light, this is EXTREMELY irritating and limits the usefulness of the camera as the low light autofocus is not great. This is the only thing about this camera which is a major drawback and is a design feature I would never like to see again.
9.0|#||#|although after 6 weeks or so after i bought it, i kept getting blank dark photos whenever i took the first photo! =/
9.0|#|A High Quality Product-fairly easy to use|#|Could use a better user manual- hardcopy in box
8.0|#|Amazing value for money, excellent picture quality, ease of use and backward compatability with minolta lenses|#|Poor range of features, limited control of camera features
9.0|#|like most products, you need to use it to realise its capabilities. Being digital it costs nothing to run as many photos as you like and edit them on the screen or computer. The auto focus is spot on.|#|None so far
8.0|#|The picture quality is superb and it can capture that action shot with no problems.|#|I am looking forward to my holidays!

10.0|#|lightweight and easy to use|#|no live feed on lcd
10.0|#|Lite and compact but with the feel of a big body camera. I use it for live gig photography in low light situations and find it easy to handle in the sometimes tight 'pit' area at the front of the crowd. Space is at a premium and this camera fits in well|#|High ISO noise can be an issue and my mac does not recognise the ARW raw format so a third party software converter is used.

10.0|#|good photos easy use|#|none
9.0|#|If you are new to dslr or looking to make the leap then I can highly recommend this camera as an entry level dslr.|#|The only bad point I would have to mention is that it does not have live view, apart from that the camera gets the thumbs up from me.
8.0|#|Stylish. Beginner friendly. Cheapest out there bar the older A200.|#|Many of the functions are options in the software and not easily reached with dedicated buttons on the body. Just means it takes a little longer to select various options.
7.0|#|It's done me well as an entry level camera|#|At 1.5 years old it's developed a rapidly degenerating fault, rendering it pretty annoying to use.
9.0|#|easy to use|#|
10.0|#|Ease of use is it's good point. For someone needing to upgrade into D-SLR camera's this would make a perfect level entry camera. Wide choice of after lenses fit this camera making lower cost lenses a good alternative.|#|Would of been nice to see some more features as found on some of the other models
8.0|#|Wireless remote (capability) - Bulb feature (allows shutter to remain open for as long as you want) - Idiot guide is useful for me ha ha (can be switched off if not required) - Size and weight (although not small it is reasonable compared to some giants out there) - New kit lens 18-55mm (very adequate for wide angle and portrait format) - Menu button is simple to use (that and a separate Fn (Function) button are well thought out) - The image quality on auto is good and better I think when you use the options P.A.S.M. - The battery is the camcorder type and lasts for ever and charges in under two hours. New firmware version 1:10 is fantastic and allows exposure to be locked via half shutter depression (but see below)|#|No Exposure lock button, which was on the previous similar model a200 (AE-L) - no wired remote socket (only wireless) so cheap interval-meters are not available - no battery extension grip available - focus shifting is a menu driven experience and takes 6 steps to change point of focus (I use Spot and shift by holding down shutter while re-aligning) - the Grip may prove difficult for some as in this model it has been made very small (it takes getting used to)
9.0|#|This is my first dslr and for the price its great!|#|The firmware could be updated to make bracketing +2 -2
8.0|#|Easy to use, from point and shoot to manual rear screen display modes make learning photographic techniques very easy to understand. I bought the camera for my daughters A level photography, unfortunately she droped the subject after 4 weeks, however she understands the basics and can make good use of the camera in manual or semi manual modes. I now have the use of a DSLR which I've missed since my 35mm film SLR. I'm very pleased with the ease of use and results from this camera. i'd lost interest with digital cameras due to shutter delay.|#|The only bd point is not having a live view to take point and shoot with the screen, however this is a minor concern and at the price I sourced the camera it is not an issue. For that type of photography a point and shoot compact is more conveinient anyway.
9.0|#|easy and fun to use|#|
10.0|#|Very easy to use and for a novice to pick up and start taking quality pictures this camera is perfect. It also has additional features for those more experienced and a great first Digital SLR.|#|Camera ergonomics aren't perfect, sometimes doesn't feel like I am holding it properly but only a minor issue.

10.0|#|It's my first DSLR camera and the directions given on the screen when using the different settings makes it very easy to understand what is happening to the image with the settings selected.  It's smaller and lighter than some of the other DSLR cameras I have seen which makes it easily portable.|#|You need to buy sony lenses as the fittings are smaller than standard lenses which are often interchangeable between brands.

9.0|#|Easy to use for someone new to SLR cameras.  If all else fails just set it to auto until such times as you want to experiment|#|Quite heavy and bulky after using a compact.  Acessories seem expensive and hard to get.

8.0|#|Great value, and not that bulky for a dslr.|#|Viewfinder image is small, makes manual focusing difficult without additional kit.

9.0|#|Improved my photography immensely. Using raw format even more so.|#|S modes the adjustment wheel is not comfortable. I have noticed the A350 is better.
9.0|#|Lighter that the Sony Alpha 100 and tilting screen is useful. Good all round performance for my needs.|#|Lens supplied did not have the same focal length range as that was supplied with the Alpha 100 kit, it is therefore less versatile. In some of the earlier generation digital cameras the viewing screen could tilt in the vertical, as well as the horizontal axis. This feature would have been useful in the 330. The non - standard (with other makes of camera)  hot shoe connector is a disadvantage.
8.0|#|ease of use value for money especially at reduced price including 18-55DT and 55-200DT SAM lens. Lightweight body and articulating screen. Good and rapid focus.  Ease of use and simple guides on the back of the screen|#|Small viewfinder, due to the articulating screen this protrudes from the back of the body which can make looking through the viewfinder difficult.
10.0|#|Lovely, versatile livescreen as well as viewfinder. Plenty of features with option of pre-sets or manual shooting.|#|Like most entry level slr cameras, the basic lens would benefit from an upgrade.

10.0|#|Picture quality is excellent, fine detail in photo's of birds in my garden is excellent.|#|Because of the short time that i've had the camera i haven't found any bad points but because the camera spends some time connected to the PC it might have been useful to be able to charge the battery whilst connected.
9.0|#|I am a beginner and i was looking for something that would easily follow a Compact D Camera without being over complex. The 330 is an easy camera to understand and I can take most pictures I want with it. I like landscape and I have added a wide angle lense which was so easy to fit. I did look at the competition but I did not want what all the mags seem to push as it is personal preference.|#|Nothing yet. Still happy.
10.0|#|The camera is so easy to use, the menu is easy to understand there is nothing complicated about it. I am not an experieced photogrpher but the results are very good. I take my camera everywhere with me. Brilliant.|#|Just the one for me. I have big hands and I keep pressing the flash button with my thumb when I'm taking pictures but it's a minor thing.
7.0|#|I have no experience of DSLR cameras but this seems to work for me. The image quality is good for me. The price for performance is good.|#|Sony have made the RAW format into ARW which makes life difficult for manipulating pictures with proprietary software.
9.0|#|Live View is great for shooting at different angles and coupled with the multi-shot enables you to great some great shots. I have found the auto focus gives very good, clear results.|#|So far I have not found any points I dislike.
10.0|#|I just love this camera.It`s so easy to use even for a beginner like.and the picture quality is absolutely great.|#|
10.0|#|I am completely new to DSLR cameras, and am really impressed with how easy this is to use and still get great shots, I  have a lot to learn but it is light to carry, easy to grip and the instruction booklet and those on the screen are brilliant. Great for all types of photos, and easy enough to use up the park with 3 kids and a dog to look after.  Really impressed!|#|Not really a bad point with the camera I just need to learn how to set it up for indoor photos and then remember to do it!!
9.0|#|It is a very user friendly product and all the programmes are easily accessible - an improvement on the Konica Minolta I used before.    Also the big plus for me is its light weight - I do now actually take it around with me on trips.    I find it very comfortable to hold and all the buttons are easy to use.|#|As I am a fairly experience DSLR user I do find it annoying that it is not possible to turn off the information which comes up on the screen every time you change the mode.
9.0|#|Great value for money with plenty of features to keep interest high.|#|
7.0|#|Very user friendly if not used to DSLR Cameras|#|Slow speeds on certain shots
9.0|#||#|None
9.0|#|It's robust build quality and excellent images|#|It has taken me alittle while to get used to the delay between pressing the shutter and capturing the image.
10.0|#|It is very easy to use. The quality is really good on the photos. Its easy to use with a computer to download software. Its not too heavy and ideal for smaller handed people like myself.|#|Doing pictures in the dark isnt too good its hard to get it to focus and produce a picture.
8.0|#|I expected good build quality and wasn't disappointed.  So far the image quality is excellent but I need to try the camera in many more different situations using different settings.|#|The main grip on the right hand side of the camera is slightly too small to be comfortable.
10.0|#|Ease of use. Build Quality. Ergonomomic Design|#|None
9.0|#|Comfortable to hold,  and controls fall easily to hand. The ability to use Minolta lenses is a plus.|#|Can be felt to be a little heavy after prolonged useage.
8.0|#|cheap and easy to use with decent image quality|#|not a large enough iso range
10.0|#|This is the first DSLR camera I have bought and it delivers really excellent pictures, compared to my 12mpx compact the picture quality is so much better. The camera is easy to use and the built-in flash works well.|#|
9.0|#|Very good value for money, some impresive features but let down slightly by build quality, but other than that a fantastic buy, I would recomend this camera to anyone entering into the DSLR market. Add this to the compatability with minolta lenses and a very good buy.|#|One down point is that auto bracketing only uses .3 or .7 stop when most HDR software needs at least a 1 stop, another is the menu could have been simpler.
8.0|#|Easy to use, a good entry level to photography.|#|
8.0|#|very easy to use and fantastic value.|#|battery is not the best and if im being a pain no extra grip YET.
10.0|#|I just love it, the picture quality is amazing the ease of use with onlscreen hints for useare just great. i take this camera just abiout everywhere with me|#|Just one, the small hand grip to the left of the camera is just a bit on the small side
8.0|#|As a first SLR that I need to serve I variety of purposes, it's good. The standard dial with different options is clear and the advantages of each stand out. The manual is great and helps you with some of the details.|#|The rotating display isn't as great as it could be because it only rotates a small amount. It also doesn't have some of the intricacies as other cameras, such as being able to go into great detail when changing shutter speeds, editing colour options. However, it is a lower priced camera and these are acceptable losses for how much you pay.
8.0|#|Takes a good photo, and incredibly good value for money, but past models I've seen have been better, but they weren't as good value as this. Feels like a DSLR, is a DSLR. Very good software comes with the camera.|#|Stated it is capable of 3 frames per second, but i haven't found a way of achieving that yet, and was quite dissapointed.
8.0|#|Easy to use in Auto seems a good build quality|#|shoot customer and more serious user means there's usually too many functions and switches to go wrong
9.0|#|Image quality; ease of use.|#|None so far
8.0|#|Easy to use, clear graphics, relatively light, good ergonomics, easy lens change, movable screen is useful.|#|No rapid shot facility in normal use, f 3.5 is too small - could be better, mode selector icons are difficult to see.
10.0|#|Does what I want it to.|#|None for my uses.
10.0|#|As my first DSLR i am very pleased with this find it easy to use and plenty to learn. You dont need to know everything as you can use the pre set settings to obtain excellent results. Then find out how the other settings work as and when you can. Lots of features for the price. A good starter for the new user of DSLR'S and not the most expensive.|#|
8.0|#|After getting used to the layout of the camera it is very easy to use. The colours of the photographs are vibrant and sharp.|#|The button to take off the lens is where you rest your hand holding the lens and so it is easy to press and and leaves a mark on your hand if using for a long period of time.
10.0|#|The pullout screen is really useful|#|Quite bulky to handle - but nor ore than simialr products.

10.0|#|very good, lovely images|#|lens caps should have a means to secure them to the camera or lens to prevent losing them. I have replaced mine with universal caps that have a strap that can be secured to the camera lens
9.0|#|I'm a complete novice when it comes to using a DSLR camera, but I have found the A330 very easy to use. I'm now trying to get away from using 'auto' for everything and developing my own 'manual' techniques.  Excellent quality of pictures. I spent far more on this camera than I have for any other camera in the past but have not regretted it at all.|#|Some of the instructions seem a little complicated for a novice like me but as I take more pictures I am learning more and more.
10.0|#||#|could benifit from mirror lock for great night sky photos
9.0|#|My first digital dslr and it was easy to get to acustomed to the varous functions. The information given on each shot is clear and easy to understand.|#|None , though I am having difficulty in finding a suitable waist bag to carry the camera.
9.0|#|Very good pictures and it explaines what different modes do.|#|No histogram and live view is unclear, if you are looking for good live view capabilitys this is not the right camera for you.
9.0|#|Although i am still finding my way around all the features I have been able to take some lovely photographs. I'm looking forward to time in the summer to really 'play' with it and I'm confident of achieving even better results once I've mastered all the features of the Camera.|#|
9.0|#|I had never owned a DSLR before and relied heavily on other reviews, the A330 was scored highly by most who were using it in a similar fashion to me. I can see why. I have taken some lovely pictures that I am very happy with, without having to think too much about it. I am by no means an experienced photographer, but I enjoy using this camera so much that I will no doubt become more experienced as it makes me want to push this camera to it maximum capabilities. The in camera image stabilisers are brilliant, as they bring down the price of the lenses to a level I can afford more comfortably.|#|The lens cap could do with a tie, to prevent it falling or being dropped in water/mud etc (yes I have done it and it had to be washed thouroughly before I placed it back on the lens, pain) Also, battery life could be a bit longer, though I have solved this by simply purchasing another battery.
7.0|#|Images are of good quality and good features expecially the tilt screen and live view. Kit lens is very good and build it image stabilisation is handy as it keeps the cost of extra lenes down in comparison to other cameras.|#|Images are quite noisey when shot at higher ISO settings (above 300), contrast and sharpness are a bit lacking if shooting high contrast pics (sunsets etc.)

9.0|#|This camera feels good in the hand and with the anti shake built into the body of the canera you do not have to purchas a special lens as with many other makes, the multi point focus works well.|#|could do with a biger batery so it lasts longer.
8.0|#|Ease of use as point and shoot, yet flexable for the more technical user. Excellent PC conectivity via USB, HDMI and removable HDSC card.|#|Should have included the remote commander as part of the package.

9.0|#|Definitely would recommend if you are looking for a value for money DSLR.|#|Not very sophisticated and too many features like those of professional models - arguably, these could be a good points on a camera marketed for non-professionals!
9.0|#|Good quality images, good product desing, easy to process pictures|#|there is no movie feaure on it
9.0|#|I was so impressed with the camera that I purchased an identical camera for my father - that must say something!|#|The camera feels a little light weight compared to other camers - this is good when carrying about as it's light but it feels a little fragile.  Sony lenses can be quite expensive though I have recently bought a new lens that proved to be a great bargain and an excellent replacement for the standard lens that came with the kit.

10.0|#|Charge it point it and shoot, im not that technical but found this product very easy to use. the image stabaliser is good if you shake a bit. the zoom is fabulous very clear shots from such a distance. the 12 megapixals give such clarity too, and the macro feature enables you to get some fantastic close ups with such clarity.|#|No case with it or strap so the extras could make it expensive,
8.0|#|Lightweight with lots of subtle little features to cater for all possible conditions.|#|Only a 3X zoom.  My previous Ixus camera had a digital zoom on top of the normal zoom - so much better for those distance shots
10.0|#||#|Have yet to find any bad points, but it is only for holiday / family pics. Would not recommend it for budding paparazzi
10.0|#|easy to use with logical control. Carl Zeis lens is better than standard make. Fits into your pocket with ease so you can take with you all of the time unlike the SLR|#|None experienced
10.0|#|This is my first digital camara so as you can imagine I'm not very technical!  I found this camara very easy to use and navigate.  It probably has a lot more functions that I don't use.  But I am happy with the purchase.|#|
10.0|#|Excellent camera which is easy to use and produces superb images. It has face and smile detection focus and has several different flash modes for different situations.|#|Small internal memory, but takes memory cards which increase the storage capacity.
9.0|#|the auto smile feature works well, and the large LCD screen is very clear. Battery life is very good. It has a slightly wider field of view than my previous compact.|#|none
8.0|#|Great if you want a simple camera.|#|Flash can sometimes be too harsh, other than that there are not really any bad points.
10.0|#|The camera is very easy to use and perfoms well.  It could have slightly more featues but other than that its very good. It is also possible to take tripod pictures by holding the camera very still.|#|None so far and we've taken over a 1,000 shots in the last two weeks.

1.0|#|the size is definately very good and its light and can easily fit into your pocket, very stylish design|#|The quality of pictures is very bad, i am absolutely disappointed with this camera, i bought it for my birthday and wanted to take pictures with my friends on my birthday dinner and all the pictures taken were horrible. The quality of the pictures was soo bad they come out very bright orange and they look like they have been glazed and all our faces looked like wax works a very disapppointing camera and I would not recommend to anyone, total waste of money.

10.0|#|Large display, simple to use, excellent picture quality|#|doesn't take normal batteries so if you forget your charger when you go away you can't just stick batteries in.  The key to this is don't forget it!
9.0|#|Lightweight, stylish and easy to use.|#|I bought a battery of the same brand with this and unfortunately I feel it doesn't last long enough. I also bought the same branded  camera case for this camera, which is again stylish but has no room for a spare battery and therefore I've been caught out with a dead camera a couple of times!

3.0|#|I like everything about this camera, except for one fundamental problem (see below) The camera is compact, well built and very easy to use.|#|BUT...... the flash is much too strong for most indoor use. Almost all flash photos come out looking bleached and overexposed.  I bought the camera to take photos of my kids whilst they are growing up. The indoor photos taken with this camera were of such poor quality that I have gone back to using my old camera simply because the results are so much better.  The camera has been a big disappointment overall, but only because of this one significant problem. The photos it takes in natural light are great.  Overall, though, I wouldn't recommend that you buy this camera.
10.0|#|easy to use even if you never taken phoots before|#|
10.0|#|build quality is excellent,very easy to use straight out of the box,and after reading instructions you find that this great little camera is capable of so mutch more. Battery life is excellent, the menus are clear and easy to use.The best compact camera i have ever purchased|#|

9.0|#|Easy to use, slim, very good quality pictures - very good camera! It is easy to review and delete photos and I am sure there are features I haven't used yet! Battery life is excellent, I have used it on 3 days out and only used half the battery...and because it is a battery pack instead of AA/AAA batteries it saves on the hassle and cost of buying batteries!|#|Can't see any up to now, very happy with the camera!
10.0|#|Everything is good. Built, Shape, Size, Edges, Functions, Ease of use. Picture Quality. The perfect one. You must buy it.|#|Just bad thing is that the picture takes time to load. It takes 1 second. But not a problem. It may be because of more pixels.
9.0|#|Excellent product, bought at a great price!!!|#|None
9.0|#|the camera is such a beauty,,,,,so user friendly and the colour is just perfect.The size suits me well as i use it most whem i'm out with my friend as it fits even in the smallest clutch bags/purse when going out at night.|#|I wish it said so in BOLD letters that it had the tinest memory or that purchasing of a memory stick should be done right away as when you buy the camera....I had to delay using it as i hadny purchased the memory stick with it...unlike my old camera DSC-T2 that had 4GB built in memory
8.0|#|Excellent picture quality and easy to use :)|#|Could be built more ruggedly
10.0|#|good quality photos as well|#|none as yet
8.0|#|A compact easy to use camera with many features found in more expensive brands.  It is ideal for people who just want to aim and shoot without getting bogged down in too much mechanical manoeuvering.|#|I found some of the menus confusing at the start, but it soon made sense.  The only criticism I have is with the opening for the lead to attach to the USB port on the computer.  I'm sure it is strongly constructed, but it does beg careful handling
10.0|#|Light and easy to use, good quality pictures|#|None
9.0|#|Compact and stylish. This is my first digital camera, and I have been impressed with how easy it is to use, and by the quality of the images captured.

10.0|#|Looks great and works great. Small unit with big screen. Fantastic vlaue for money from a brand leader.|#|None
5.0|#|Easy to use like as with most Sony Cybershor cameras|#|Picture quality. Eventhough the camera has 12xMP, the quality of close up images are blurred. The problem with this camera is that it does not have a recognosed manufacturer's lense, e.g. carl zeiss, pentax. 12xMP does not enhance the image quality if the lense quality is poor.
8.0|#|Slim size|#|Battery
3.0|#|the only good point is that its sony product|#|image quality is not that good that 12 mega pixels should be..
9.0|#|I love the fact that you can put it on a setting where it will only take the photo if you are smiling!!|#|
9.0|#|I bought this particular model because of good 3rd party reviews and its very compact size.  I was also impressed by Sony brand quality|#|Nothing bad although 3X optical zoom could be improved on.

6.0|#|Its got a very clear picture. Very Easy to use and small and compact. A load of range of colours|#|When images are loading they take a litle time to go clear. Does not have many features e.g action shots, night shots etc

9.0|#|Great picture quality, and keeps focus even with full zoom. Has lots of functions for different settings e.g. for snow, also can manually alter settings for light balance etc. Very light, therefore easy to carry, with a vast range of  accessories available.|#|Flicking through photos in playback is quite slow, due to factory set image size. However, is better with smaller image size.
9.0|#|so far it has been easy to set up and use.|#|
7.0|#|pocket sized|#|none
10.0|#|Great value, easy to use, would highly recommend this product|#|
6.0|#|HD video quality is good.|#|Tends to overexpose photos, especially when shooting with the flash.
5.0|#|good quality pictures in daylight ,  panorama mode good but prone to fail regular, zoom works while in the movie mode which is a plus. the camera  is light and compact|#|poor  quality pictures with  flash mode,  shaded in corner which is very annoying,  twilight mode in mid zoom pictures appear over exposed,  had previously had the sony p200 a far better quality camera,
7.0|#|Low light shooting|#|Quite a few images in bright light appear to be slightly fuzzy
10.0|#|The face detection is brilliant, the panorama is a first, the autofocus is instant and the anti blur is perfect. I love photography and those opportunities to take that once in a lifetime picture dont come along very often, when they do you have a second or two to prepare and this is the camera I now carry wherever I am in the World to capture them. It is the best camera I have every owned, it is idiot proof, I didnt even read the manual, thats how easy it is to use. I would strongly recommend the WX1 to anybody.|#|Nothing
10.0|#|This cameras low light ability make me smile all the time, prior to the Sony I had a canon Ixus 900ti which i thought was a good camera, but the difference is night and day. You will also love the panoramic feature. HD video is fantastic and the smile function is a good laugh!|#|Don't like the position of the zoom, feel it should be controlled with the index finger and not the thumb, could do with a few more traditional manual controls for when you want to experiment.
10.0|#|Takes lovely photos everytime. The sweep panorama is very easy to use. Indicates if someone had eyes closed in photo. You can set it so that it take two photos at the same time, one with a higher ISO level than the other so one is a little brighter and then you can choose which you prefer. The camera is very stylish looking and has a fantastic video recorder in HD quality. Money well spent.|#|Once you take a sweep panorama it views small and long on your PC but there must b a way to view bigger. Not waterproof but I hear you can buy housing
9.0|#|Its solidly built, light and compact.|#|Outdoor photos appear slightly over-exposed, but this can be corrected by adjusting the EV meter down a little (directly accessed by the thumb-stick).   Its expected that a f/w update will corrected this.
7.0|#|Video quality is exceptionally good. I like the new sweep panorama function|#|Most of the images taken indoor has dark corners. The image quality is not as good as I expected from a sony digital camera.
5.0|#|Easy to use, sturdy build, light, good low-light shots|#|Not good in high light condition and unable to cope with snow scenes even on preset. Photos lack depth of colour - sky is grey, no contrast when used in bright sunlight. Very disappointing
2.0|#|Both spec and camera look good|#|Constantly freezes and takes poor photos. Sony service centre claims there is nothing wrong, so if there nothings wrong it must be design....
2.0|#|exactly as above|#|cracks around picture taking button, also shutter only closes half way once power is turned off!
6.0|#|small and compact|#|its being sent back already for repair
3.0|#|Small, easily portable|#|Poor quality pictuures when shot indoors. Visible noise even on outdoor shots taken in excellent light
8.0|#|Excellent compact camera with great features and great picture quality.|#|Annoying message each time the camera is swtched on, indicating that the memory card may be full or may not record. Sony tell me this an automatic warning feature that cannot be diabled!
9.0|#|Good picture and easy to use|#|controls a bit small
9.0|#|Excellent low light photography. Fast start up. Rapid shots in high definition is great. Movie mode is probably better than most palm cine cameras.|#|Memory sticks are expensive; why not use the standars SD cards?
8.0|#|excellent allrounder, good image quality,|#|would be better with a bit more manual control
10.0|#|Loads of handy features that are easy to use. Excelent low light ability. Smile shutter with blink detector is fun. Build quality seems grrrreat. Video and sound are pretty good too.|#|Not 100% on the general picture quality, but I ain't used it much yet.
8.0|#||#|The lens open extend and the reverse on close is a tad slow. My previous canon IXUS was quicker.
8.0|#|It's simple to use, small, and the panorama facility is excellent.|#|Just more ability to be creative.

10.0|#|best camera I had so far|#|

10.0|#|Just a joy to use.|#|Haven't found any yet
10.0|#|Use .....it is straightforward|#|I would like an idiots guide to how to use the camera and also how to get the best results from your camera ...rather than to assume that any user has the techical know how and finesse and expertise to take a good picture,,,
9.0|#|Extremely easy to use to get good results plus the panoramic function is brilliant on scenery|#|Doesn't come with a memory stick
10.0|#|An excellent compact camera giving outstanding results in all situations.  The low light capability is extremely good and the panoramic feature can give brilliant effects.  A superb package in a tiny body that fits easily in a pocket..|#|None
9.0|#|also the panorama feature is so easy to use.|#|The view finder screen is hard to see in bright sunlight, largely due to its shiney reflective glass finish.
9.0|#|Speed of use is great; love the wide angle; pictures are great, and in low light they're actually AMAZING.|#|Sometimes the camera takes forever to register a photo, meaning a very long wait to take the next one.  I'm not using the full pixel count, so don't know why, particularly since the problem is only intermittent.  I really wish I could toggle between flash and low-light no-flash settings.  Seems like dozens of steps are required, so I miss pictures or don't even try because it's just too complicated.  When we start up the camera, we don't know what setting is in effect, so have to stumble around a bit.  Panorama photo is very tricky, as is video.
9.0|#|The DSC-WX1N is light weight and easy to use. It has an automatic feature that sets the flash when the light starts to fade, targets faces even on the TV.|#|The sound in movie mode isn't up to much but to be honest Its a camera not a movie recorder.
10.0|#|The camera is beautiful to look at before and after pictures are taken, the low light lens is far beyond expectations enabling me to take pictures in the most dark of places with more clarity than my own eyes! Truley fantatasic, since the first few months of purchase I cannot fault it. In conclusion best thing ever!|#|
8.0|#|Video quality looks good|#|Not at all convinced by the special low light feature which combines multiple images
10.0|#|The panorama feature, seemed a but over the top, until we used it.  Very impressed with the quality of the final pictures.|#|The screen gets scratched easily, the connector is proprietary meaning you have to carry around a special cable to view the pictures on a TV.   When zoomed in on optical zoom the pictures lose some of their clarity.
3.0|#||#|I have returned this product because I realize that the flash is to close to lens so its giving a shadow on the pictures
10.0|#|This camera does everything it says on the tin. The photo quality is brilliant, the colours are crystal clear. The panaromic mode is really good for capturing those beautiful views. Burst mode gives a great bit of fun on a day out with friends, ive got every moment of my 3 friends cartwheeling captured from start to finish, great for making sure you always remember that penlty at that all important footy match. I brought the camera specially for a Kenya holiday at the end of the year and after playing around with the different modes and features can't wait to get out there. Twilight mode also is very good on this camera especially for sunset shots the colours are still as intense as they were when u sat watching it. Definately a must have camera.|#|I can't really find any major bad points with this camera, the only slight 1 is i keep forgetting that this camera has short cut buttons for burst mode and panarama and i also forgetting to take it out of those modes before taking a normal picture. This is more due to me getting used to the camera rather than there being anything wrong with it.
10.0|#|Its quite a small camera which is really good and it is very light to hold has lots of great features and produces great high quality images. Would recommend to a friend!|#|
10.0|#|an excellent made camera high quality construction with excellent features I really like the panoramic  sweep modes and the camera is a nice size not to big not to small 5x zoom wide angle lens hd movie mode with zoom control overall superb camera highly recommended|#|
9.0|#||#|I wish the camera had a mini or micro usb connector, instead of the proprietry connector on the bottom
9.0|#|Unique features in the class on market, like sweep panorama, low-light sensitivity and very useful intelligent mode.|#|Even the optics gives the widest angle, any zoom applied rapidly affects the clarity of the picture.

9.0|#|Design, Compact size, build quality, superb picture quality|#|No one-button access to exposure compensation.  The highest resolution  of 10.2M gives a picture ratio of 4:3 so 6x4 reference prints have to be cropped or resized. The 3:2 ratio is available only at 8M resolution.
8.0|#|good picture quality, easy to use, very quick shutter speed(wich is why we purchased this camara).|#|Having now used the camara for a time have now realised it lacks close up telephoto capability,(zoom). Also the camara is not easy to hold as the frame is very small,and the buttons are too easy to touch with your fingers. It may be my computor, but i still cant down load vidio clips taken with the camara, hope to overcome this little quirk soon.

9.0|#|night time shots outside absolutly brilliant.|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use and feature rich.  Especially good at low light without flash, where the flash can wash out the subject|#|The connectivity cable...too many wire and the software provide which didn't install properly on my PC
8.0|#|Battery length is good, screen is clear with brightness adjustment.  Panorama feature and smile feature are useful.|#|Video, although HD is still a bit jumpy if camera is moving quickly.  Other than that, no issues.
10.0|#|The camera is very light in weight - perfect to fit into a handbag in a protective case.  The booklet is comprehensive and I have been pleased with all the results so far.  It has been brilliant being able to experiment too with the different options available.|#|I haven't found any so far, and hope things remain that way.
9.0|#|Low light pictures.|#|No touch screen.
9.0|#|the panoramic phot facility is really good and the picture quality excellent, great extra like option for taking photos of pets, action, point AND SHOOT IS FAB etc|#|much smaller camera than i am used to with my older sony model and if in a soft case you keep switch it on when you pick the case up (I will invest in a hard case
8.0|#|size which makes ideal for day to day use.  The LCD is also clear and very responsive to fast moving subject matter. Battery life is also excellent.|#|For the price I would have expected a higher pixel count as 10.2 is nothing special in this day and age.  Again 5x optical zoom falls short of competitors, but given the issue with flare, perhaps anything more than 5x would just make matters worse.
9.0|#|Great to have an easy 'point and squirt' setting, yet have the option of many other settings should you feel a little more adventurous or wanting to have any special effects. Video setting works exceptionally well and makes the need for a still camera and a video camera almost redundant. Nice compact size. Can't compliment it enough really.|#|Nothing bad so far.
7.0|#|High-speed multi-shot is excellent, capturing up to 10 frames a second is really helpful for that perfect picture (think fleeting facial expressions or wedding confetti pictures). It's easy to set up the programme settings for your style of photos and the colour reproduction is excellent, especially with the Dynamic Range Optimisation|#|Not quite up to a wide range of shots, such as elapsed time.
9.0|#|Chose this camera for its fast speed at taking pictures indoors and for the panorarma feature. Both have not disappointed a plus is the flash does not blind people as my old camera did. My daughter was going to have my old camera but on seeing my new one decided she would like one for her 30th birthday present.|#|So far I have not found any.

10.0|#|Also, the burst shot was great, taking 2, 5 or 10 shots per second is a useful feature especially for capturing moving objects. Video recording was a delight too and the quality was great.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|Compact, slips into any pocket.  Quick start up with fast focus and zoom.  In poor light conditions with no flash the pictures are invariably better than if the flash is used.

10.0|#|What I like most about this camera is that its picture quality and its really easy to use and the feature to capture a landscape photograph is excellent....|#|The only negative I say is its price, its bit expensive but if you can afford it then its excellent.
9.0|#|Superb low level shooting and some very clever features really make this a superb camera for the money.|#|Nothing so far

10.0|#|The panoramic shot is an excellent addition to this superb little camera!|#|Our old cyber-shot was unable to zoom in on movie mode, with this new camera you can, which is great, but you can slightly hear the camera zooming in when playing back the movie clips, but it is only a minor niggle, and the movie quality is excellent.
9.0|#|High pixel camera with easy to use or more complex options depending on user|#|Charging means removing the battery, not the most practical idea

8.0|#|Able to take small movie lengths. Small and Compact.|#|Missing the traditional viewfinder which means there is some camera shake having to use the screen. Sometimes slow at focusing on a subject a a large number of shots are blurred. My last camera, an 8 year old Olympus digital Camedia, took far better shots but is bulky. Possibly in time I will get to understand the cybershot camera and its complicated menu.

10.0|#|Excellent camera in all aspects. function and performance.|#|
9.0|#|The Sweep Panorama, Hnad held Twilight mode are nice feature made easy in WX 1S. The HD video recording has enhanced the value of the camera more. The size is compact and palm friendly.|#|Lack of features for taking shots in Sepia, B/W etc...The noise of zoom-in and zoom-out while shoting video is not so good.

8.0|#|Having used a pocket snapshot digital camera for a number of years, it is good to get back to an SLR and the Sony DSLR-A380 is a great introduction to the digital version to SLR photography. It is comfortable and has excellent ergonomic properties. The technology on offer is wide ranging from a fully automatic setting that gives good results to fully manual where the photographer takes charge. There is a lot to learn, both the camera and the picture processing, but I feel that this camera will help and support that educational journey perfectly.|#|The worst point for me is the life of the battery between charges and that a car charger as standard would be a real benefit for ensuring that a fully charged battery is available on the move.

9.0|#|Easy to use and not to heavy the carry or use.  The camera appears to be well built and lives up to Sony reputation. I had a fairly old high spec Minbolta SLR and the minolta lenses fitted and worked perfectly on the DSLR saving some considerable money. There are plenty of extras for this camera available from lots of different suppliers thatr do not cost the earth.|#|Not a lot to say here, I have owned the camera for 2 months and was purchased primarily for astronomy photography, and so far there have been no problems.
10.0|#|A fantastic camera, well made and solid feel without being heavy and cumbersome.  A great move for someone wanting to go from simple compact to the next level even if the learning curve is steep.|#|The learning curve is so step for a novice user moving from point and shot to even this level of DSLR.
7.0|#|SD card and memory stick usage, nice feel to camera, good lens 55-80, viewfinder and screen interchangability, happy to have this camera, did not buy got as 40 year service award, probably would have bought a Sony lower down in range if I had to pay for it, prices very good compared with other makes|#|sometimes slow in operation, some buttons mistaken in operation, a lot of information available that I will not use
8.0|#|It feels good, looks good and as someone who wears glasses can be used well in viewfinder mode. With a Zeiss lens it takes it into another category of quality.|#|The information in viewfinder mode is rather difficult to see being so small.

8.0|#|This was an big upgrade in digital cameras for me and I bought it just before going on holiday to NZ for.   So it was a case of using all the settings and getting to know what they were for.    It was easy to use and I liked the explanations on the different settings instead of having to refer to the instruction book all the time.

9.0|#|It works excellently especialy with the 70400G lens|#|I do not seem to be able to prevent the flash from operating except with the single designated position.

10.0|#|I have just changed over from a film SLR, my only other experience of digital photography with a compact camera from the same company. I have found the transaction much less complicated than I was expecting, but a good read of the instruction book is necessary. All the programmes and other relevant information are clearly displayed on the screen, the camera fits comfortably to the hand and controls are suitably placed and easy to use. I use it mainly for wildlife photography and use a wireless remote control so the ability to shut down and conserve battery power between shots  is very useful. The picture quality is first class.|#|The screen is level with the rear of the camera and therefore requires the purchase and application of a protective cover to prevent any damage.

10.0|#|The live view and adjustable screen, means that you can hold your camera in a position either above your head or very low down making shots possible that would have been very difficult otherwise.|#|It didn't worry me that there was no video capability, although now I can appreciate why this might be very useful.
10.0|#|I have had this camera for over a year now,this was an upgrade for me from sony a330,and i have to say i love it.The camera is very easy to use,the menu has a very nice lay out,easy to understand and control.There are dedicated buttons for different controls and it makes adjusting stuff very easy.The battery life is superb as well,you will go for hours even with the liveview on.It also has a very nice grip to it,i have got big hands but it still fits my hand perfectly.The picture quality is just amazing,there is no video on it but why would i want the video function on my slr anyway.If you are in doubt to get this camera,dont be,and just buy it,you will love it.|#|The kit lens could be a bit better,but still it does the job and produces outstanding pictures.
10.0|#|If you can afford it, buy it! No regrets!|#|Ok, to be a bit picky...the instruction book is not great (but managable). There is a dedicated book available by david busch...a must for the novice.

9.0|#|A really good purchase.|#|You need to flip a switch to change between memory card storage. Not a big issue depending on card size or photo quantity. Possible a slight nag to some people.
9.0|#|It's easy to use the basic functions but I've got some learning to do.|#|I think the colour is a bit towards to red end of the spectrum which meant that the colour wasn't always true to real life and I'm not sure how to correct that.  Otherwise, quite happy

9.0|#|All the controls are easily accessible. I have made quite extensive use of HDR and DRange function. I liked the way the latest setting is retained as I used to find it frustrating when previous camera (Alpha 100) returned to default every time you switched off but am now finding that you have to remember to amend last setting when necessary.|#|Difficult to use LCD screen in the sunlight as hard to see the image.

8.0|#||#|The optical view finder is set too far forward in relation to the screen, which means that it is unavoidable to use the camera without smearing the screen with grease from your face (or scratch it). This is a really annoying oversight. Perhaps you only tested it with Japanese heads when you designed it?
9.0|#|some nice features and produces high quality images.|#|No video.

9.0|#|For a first timer; really impressed and so has both my designer and printer been impressed with the quality of the shots provided, Shooting in both RAW and JPG has meant they have been able to easily enhance in adobe photoshop. So I have saved myself and my company a considerable amount of money thanks to the ease and quality I gained from the Alpha A550.|#|Difficult to say at the moment as I am a novice who has achieved his objective from control of the creative photo input and saved a considerable amount of time and money from doing so.

9.0|#|picture quality, very good fast auto focusing, moveable lcd, exposure is pleasing for auto and semi auto settings.|#|would be someting for sony to consider that the left hand side of the camera was extended so that the camera can be more of  glove fit for persons with larger hands, small hands are fine for compacts, but big hands need something to hold thereby completing the, want to keep using all the time, feeling towards this  camera.
9.0|#|Good to handle. Well balanced and sits well in hand. Excellent LCD monitor. Two Live View Options. 14.2 mega pixels.

9.0|#|The camera has many useful features from the adjustable live view screen to very efficient steady shot technology and now with Carl Zeiss and G lens image quality is very high with easy to use Sony technology. Camera is comfortable to hold and great to look at! Menu screen is easy to read and very helpful with handy tips stored on camera.|#|The only bad feature is the decision to remove ISO 100 for ISO 12800 which is rediculous. ISO 100 is the highest image quality setting for any camera. Although at ISO 200 and 400 the image is good at ISO 12800 the image is grainy, I took a set of images at various shutter speeds and aperture settings in various lighting conditions and at this setting the image quality is very poor. There is no need to shoot any higher than ISO 6400, the image is already grainy here, so to lose ISO 100 is futile.
8.0|#|The picture quality is amazing, and the flip out lcd screen is really useful, although if it had been able to pivot left and right too, that would have been amazing.|#|I upgraded from an A100, and expected it to be virtually the same but with a few extra bells and whistles... instead I found that I had to learn how to take pictures all over again, as the interface was so completely different to my old camera.
8.0|#|Excellent entry-level controls; easy to use; generally good image quality; plenty of feedback and always aware of what the camera is actually doing (in terms of settings) from the information on-screen.|#|Adjusting settings in manual modes can be quite fiddly at times; accessing some of the more advanced controls likewise; software bundle is not very user-friendly - lightroom is a far better and more acessible product to give a comparison.

8.0|#|8. Image noise quality at higher ISO is an improvement, but could still be better.|#|4. The camera on/off switch can too easily be hit when accessing the wheel adjustment at the front of the grip - I quite often switch the camera off by mistake, when trying to turn the wheel to alter shutter speed, etc.

8.0|#|The Manual Focus Live-View Check mode looks like it will be very handy for some of my macro and landscape work, though I have not given it a thorough workout yet.|#|The viewfinder is a little small and dull but not ridiculously so for a camera in this price range.
9.0|#|I have been a Minolta owner for over 30 years and the fact that Sony bought various parts from Minolta meant that all my Autofocus Lenses and accessories fit my new Sony Alpha 550.  I have not yet had the opportunity to take many photos with the camera but those that I have, have been excellent. I have also purchased now the Vertical Grip for the Camera which has helped no end.|#|Not bad but I feel could have been better is the movement of the rear screen.  It is O.K. that it pulls out so that pictures at low level can be taken but if the screen swivelled it would be so much better. Nevertheless I can live with it.

9.0|#|DRO, HDR, excellent bright detailed LCD, excellent manual focus check, improved angles of LCD tilt, very good high ISOs and noise reduction.|#|No mirror lock up! No focus confirmation or SSS with old manual lenses! Awkward switching between auto and manual focus. Dark LCD when using manually controlled remote flashguns and shutter sync speed and flash aperture too dark, makes studio flash work very fiddly. These are trivial extras whose absence has been much criticised on previous lower numbered alphas, and would have turned a merely good camera into an excellent one.

8.0|#|HDR and Live View are useful features|#|The on/off switch is badly arranged. It can be operated inadvertently therby switching the camera off whilst using the selector on the hand grip.

8.0|#|Good image quality, several useful features(MF check LV especially useful for Macro work), reasonably priced. All in all a good buy|#|Initially awkward to use for anyone used to the layout of previous Alpha models. I've found out that the inherited non-standard Minolta hotshoe design can cause a few headaches if you want to get into off-camera flash/strobist stuff (something to be aware of if you're a first time DSLR buyer) but that's a generic Alpha  issue, not just this particular model.

10.0|#|Having been wedded to a Canon EOS for many years, moving to digital was a fraught experience until I found the Panasonic Lumix which supassed all of my expectations apart from shutter speed, so I thought, until I invested in the Sony Alpha 550, now I realise what I have been missing all these years, ease of operation,good range of programmes, fast shutter speeds, quick auto focusing and pinpoint clarity of photo with a good range of telephoto lens to choose from. I prefer a chunky good weight camera to these lightweight ones and this fitted the bill well, without being over the top. I take a lot of wildlife and animal photos where speed and clarity are essential, this has not let me down in any way. I have yet to explore all of the programs but what I have seen so far I would highly recommend.|#|No found so far, apart from perhaps having to invest in a LCD cover to protect the screen, whereas the Lumix has one built in by reversing the screen.

8.0|#|Excellent photographs, very good ergonomics for quick, easy handling, well planned menus.  The viewfinder is very good.  The Sony lenses (I use the 'G' 70-300 a lot) are excellent.  Also, older Minolta lenses work very well (I use a 1997-purchased 28-105 Minolta).  This is a strong, chunky design that fits the hand nicely and is intuitive in use.  Anyone who's used the Sony Alpha 700 will find the 850 very similar, but with even better image quality.|#|No bad points really; it's exactly as specified.  Thus, it has no built-in flash, no electronic viewfinder, no live view, no tilitng screen.  All of these factors would be of little use to me (Mostly, I photograph aircraft).  Other reviews state that the noise levels at ISO ratings over 100 could be better, but I very rarely use ISO settings outside the 100-400 range, and the images within this range show very little digital degredation.
10.0|#|It is a fantastic full frame camera and especially for the price.  Plenty of options in the menus. The Preview Button is a little treasure to use, you can check the image quality and expoure and composition without taking a shot.  An even better plus is that it will also trigger a Sony Speedlight if it is off camera and on a lead. Image quality has lots of WOW factor!!!  I use Sony and Sigma EX lenses and they are supurb on this camera, would highly recommend it if you want to try full frame photography.|#|The only bad point for me is the fact that it does not have a wireless flash sensor, if it did it would be the best camera ever!!
9.0|#|It is a strong, durable high-quality piece of engineering which is very effective when used as a traditional SLR.  Superb results can be obtained in demanding sitations (I'm mainly an aviation photographer).|#|If you like complex product features in your digital camera (like video, or tilting screens) this is not the camera for you.  If you need to frequently use very high ISO values, it is unsuitable for this purpose, as its best noise peformance is at the lower end of light value settings.  It has no built-in flash, which affects me very little but which might not suit everybody.  It has no weaknesses when used normally at light values up to and including 400 ISO.
8.0|#|picture quality but high iso noise, build quality|#|poor high iso performance-noise, frames per second should be much higher, no movie mode, shake reduction system not good enough, sensor cleaning system should be more efficient
9.0|#|Outstanding image quality. Amazing detail. Wonderful colours. Solid, well made body. Great user interface. Great camera for landscape photographers. Easy access to most used features, including mirror lock up. Really like perfect shot preview.|#|Dust on sensor!!! Loud shutter.
10.0|#|Carries over the best features of the high end Minolta cameras and allows the use of all Minolta AF lenses. Excellent control layout and Menu organization. Many thoughtfull touches such as the hinged cover for the PC flash socket. Very good viewfinder. Really though this camera has most appeal to converts from professional film cameras who do not need video, scene modes, smile detection, built in flash or the host of other features found on most compacts.|#|No real criticisms, but the choice of the mini version for  the USB-B socket seems odd, the standard USB-B appears more robust and is fitted to much smaller cameras than this. The lack of direct view is a shame, it is the one missing feature I would most have liked. Also it is a pity that Sony have not provided support for Minolta Flash guns.

I can use all my existing Minolta AF lens from the past and the A450 has some great features that only professional cameras have it is faster in all ways gos down to lower light levels.|#|The only bad thing I can say is that it feels a little plasticie if I have to compare it to my Konica Minolta 5D but the Minolta 5D was a 1st generation Digital SLR.

9.0|#|Quick access for camera removal and then use of flat area to give support and small work area.|#|position before fully opening. So a bit of a trade off I would agree with.

5.0|#|Excellent picture quality|#|The camera is more difficult to use than my 7 year old DSC W1! The only regret is the brand seem to have made the camera more challenging to use, when it should use some thought and make stuff to be easier to use! Reading a manual was not my idea, and having read it, did not add value as well!
10.0|#|takes pictures well, small, fits in my  handbag|#|No bad points
8.0|#|easy to use|#|cant use simple USB lead and some times take bluery pic even on auto
9.0|#|For my purposes,general photographs of the grandchildren,holidays etc it is an excellent product.As of yet I havn't learnt to use all its features but tend to rely on its fully automatic facility.I guess if I wished I could probably make much more use of its other features.Wee explained in its manual.|#|None that I know of

10.0|#|Great photos, great features and light to hold, I cant fault this camera at all.|#|I have no bad points at all
10.0|#|The camera is so easy to use that you dont even need to fiddle about with settings. The image quality is IMMACULATE. It is slim, lightweight and very stylish. The fact that it comes in a range of bright colours just adds to all the good points. I have saved and searched cameras for 3 months to ensure that I got the best deal and a fantastic camera at the end of it. This camera fulfilled all my expectations and im glad that I waited and researched it properly. 10 out of 10!!|#|There are honestly no bad points. I cannot think of any improvements I could suggest or any draw backs.
8.0|#|Slimline, good quality pictures|#|Not as strongly made as my last Sony Camera.  Need to be very careful when opening bottom to get access to battery etc.  Quite flimsy and I would imagine would easily break......
8.0|#|Compact and lightweight.  26mm (equivalent) wide angle Carl Zeiss lens is great for shots of buildings, interiors and landscapes.  Excellent image quality from experience so far (about a month of use).  Good range of resolutions and proportions, e.g. 4:3 and 16:9.  I already have Sony MS Pro Duo cards, but if you are not already a Sony user, it will take the more common (and cheaper) SD cards as well.|#|Shutter button is very narrow and almost flush, making it difficult to press, so does not always capture the shot at the precise moment you want it to.  One or two shots failed to focus properly, which I suspect is down to the same problem, i.e. you think you've half pressed the shutter to focus, but it hasn't operated.
10.0|#|The image quality on the pictures is excellent. The camera turns on quickly which means I don't miss those special shots that I used to miss when I had a slower camera. The auto setting on it means you don't have to fiddle around changing settings before taking photos in different settings. The smile sensor is great espcially for taking photos of my baby - who was the whole reason I bought the camera. You are able to remove the red eye easliy on the camera before downloading your photos which is very useful. I'm really pleased with the beautiful pictures I have taken with the camera and would recommend it as a good compact camera that is easy to use.|#|None really.
5.0|#|Pretty easy to use and quite small. If you aren't too bothered about excellent images and just want a camera that's really easy to use this might be the one for you, as the price is quite good. Still, I wouldn't go for this one. The more expensive Cybershots are better.|#|I found this make of the Cybershot to be overly simplified, and it almost made it more frustrating to use. I didn't feel that the image quality was as good as it was on my older model, which took much sharper images and had more adaptability in terms of functions.  The majority of photos came out a bit blurred, even with image stabilization on. As I have a good amount of photographic experience, I like being able to have more control over the settings and functions, and this camera was so simplified that it wasn't really possible. I wouldn't recommend this if you tend to me a bit more technical in your use of a point and shoot (I realize in that case you might go for a more advanced camera although I've found older models to be quite good in terms of being a small yet good quality camera).

9.0|#|First of all I noticed how lightweight this camera is.  The camera turns on quickly and has a large clear screen/viewfinder on the back.  The controls/menus are simple to use and intuitive.  The picture quality is excellent no doubt aided by the image stabilisation feature.  The ability to recognise faces is very impressive too.|#|

10.0|#|this camera comes in a good range of colours which appeals to many people , its face recognition is good because it focus and picks out the facial detail on portraits, you can easily change the setting to how you would like them , i like how you can change how many mega pixles there are, the sound quality on  the video is good and the replay is of good quality , the overall desgin is light and stylish, quick upload to a computer|#|the play back for photos is slow and takes a long time to load, there wasnt any memory card included

10.0|#|This is fantastic camera. It is so easy to use. Uploading pictures is as easy as plugging it into your PC! No unneccessary applications. The picture quailty is brillaint.|#|When reviewing the pictures on the camera, it looks like they are a bad quailty but once uploaded you see this isnt true. Once you have inserted the memory card I can't see the pictures on the camera that are stored on the internal memory, but you can see all pictures once you have plugged it into your PC.

Whether this was a fault with the model or just the camera I don't know.  Ultimately this rendered the camera useless as I could not rely on it to take action pictures, therefore it was returned to the store for refund.

7.0|#||#|I had some problems with downlaoding to computer, either with USB lead or a card reader. it seems a littl bit hit and miss on any one occasion whether it will work or not.
9.0|#|This camera is very compact and easy to carry.  It has sufficient features for my use - holidays etc - and I have been pleased with the general quality of images.  The battery has more than sufficient life for my needs after a full charge|#|I am slightly disappointed at the limited zoom but, having said that, the images I took with the zoom are not very clear. I assume a better zoom function would make the images worse without a tripod.  In addition, although the wide angle lens is useful at times, it tends to distort part of the image at close range - for example in a group photo, some of the heads tend to look strangely misshaped.
8.0|#|Was bought by my familt to replace my old sony bought 6 years ago. Dont like the cheaper quality dials.  Dont know why they couldnt charge battery plugged direct into camera like old one instead of having to take a charger everywhere instead of just a cable.!!!! Who says technology goes forward.  Sony hasnt!!!|#|

10.0|#|the sound quality is amazing on the film feature, there is no distortion which i did expect. the features on the camera are really querky too, i have used the smile shutter and caught some brilliant photos that are spontaneous and not posed which are always the best. i would highly recommend this to any one, i am an amature when it comes to camera but my friend has used it and he has said that for a compact digital camera it is extremely good.|#|when using the film feature you cant zoom in and so have to set this before you start, which can be a pain if you want to zoom in and out during filming
9.0|#|The picture quality is amazing and it is very easy to use and upload your photos.|#|There is very little internal memory (only 5 pics!) and pictures look blurry when you are taking them most of the time. However the camera does correct this itself.
10.0|#|BRILLIANT, SMALL, HIGH QUALITY!!. Great for beginners or just to have handy!. High quality image resolution and quality with the 14mps that are equiped with the camera. beautiful viewing screen for viewing your photos and videos. very compact, fits right in your pocket ready for a quick whip out captured in high quality pictures or videos.|#|cant find any bad points but a few features that would make this camera even better would be HD recording and some more zoom. sure 4x is good for the camera size but it can let you down once you've fully zoomed amd digitaly zoomed in.

9.0|#|Great lens (Carl Zeiss are difficult to beat, maybe only a Leica lens could compete) coupled with 14.1 mp = excellent images. Surprisingly good screen, that is clear to view even in bright light conditions. I particularly like the soft background option, which allows me to approximate a rangefinder-like image.|#|Occasionally slow response times, mainly in low light conditions (I don't use flash) and could use a classical viewfinder (but then so could most of these little compacts).

What do you expect for such a price! It seems solid enough for me - but I haven't dropped it yet!  Great portrait mode, great sports mode. I just think it's a great camera and just right for anyone who wants to move up a little. I got it at an incredibly low price and I don't see me buying another camera for years if at all!|#|I have is I just wish they had used a simple attachment strap for the lens cover - I've already lost mine!
9.0|#|I love the quality of the images....the lightness of the camera.....the accuracy of the flash.|#|.....but much more still to learn
8.0|#|This is a really good camera for the beginner or moving on to being an advanced user.  It is easy to operate and understand and produces great quality photographs.  It is very robust and can take a knock or to without any obvious detrement to its use and I am very happy indeed with it.  Best value for money I have ever spent on a camera.|#|Some would say that this camera should have video but for me, if you want video, buy a video camera.  The one thing that is missing is an adjustable screen with live view.  No other issues with this camera.

(or is it me that takes the great photo's Oh hum now there is a thought to start the day)
9.0|#|Picture quality is excellent with the correct settings. Battery life is good allowing around 1500 photographs on a full charge. SD card slot is in this model so existing sd cards can be used as well as new sdhc cards. Kit lens (18-55mm) is good quality and availability of second hand lenses is good especially with the range of konica minolta lenses interchangeable. Functions and features seem to be endless and the help display is very good to assist a new user understand the settings. Ability to take photographs in raw and jpeg formats individually or at the same time is great if you want to edit the original files.|#|No auto focus is available in live view on this model. Flimsy covers over connection slots seem a bit poor in comparison to the cover over the memory card slots.
10.0|#|nice looking camera. I bought it to repalce my Sony Cyber shot DSC P52 which still works fine but I wanted a smaller more handbag size one. I've gone from a 3.2 mega pixel to a 10.1.

It is stylish, easy to use, compact to carry around and the picture quality is excellent.  The Sony Cyber Shot in my opinion is fantastic value for money.|#|If I had to be picky it would be the case, that said I still use it.
8.0|#|For the price point this is a good starter / normal use camera. If you want to take family shots or shots of days out then you cannot go wrong with this camera. If however you want professional shots, then spend a little more money and buy a camera for that job as this won't really cut it.|#|

9.0|#|Recommended.|#|Make sure you use the wrist strap before switching on as the lens shoots out when switched on and if your fingers are in the way, well!!
9.0|#|Fantastic camera - easy to use and picture quality is excellent. The HD video is supurb even when played back on a 50 inch plasma its a good as broadcast quality. I took a long time to choose between this camera and Panasonic's TZ10 and am sure that I made the right choice|#|None so far
9.0|#|This is an amazing camera and camcorder in one small box. It produces real HD video, taken at 1080 50i not the usual 720 25p. This video looks like TV not the jittery images so many so called HD compacts produce. The video looks even better because the lens can be very wide angle one minute and telephoto the next. Wide angle lens in consumer camcorders seem to be a 2010 hot thing and they are well worth the wait. In the past you would have moved your camcorder from left to right to show your audience the whole picture. Now you can just point your wide angle lens video camcorder at the scene and let the scene do the talking|#|

8.0|#|Excellent image quality, great fun features like panoramic images and smile recognition. The camera is lightweight and compact so you don't mind just slipping it in your pocket whenever you go out.|#|Although the battery (when fully charged) lasts for hours, don't forget your charger when you go away because you can't just pop in a couple of AA's.
10.0|#|This is an absolutely amazing camera, double-amazing for the price!  With GPS, compass, 1080i HD video recording, 10x true optical zoom and a huge 10 megapixel sensor for stills, it's a fantastic device.   The included mapping software produces a display of exactly where all your photos were taken and even which direction you were looking - fantastic reference.   The 1080i video truly trumps the capabilities of even the latest SLR cameras in terms of zoom and focussing - amazing!   It will be a long time before I can imagine wanting a better compact camera than this.|#|USB/breakout connector isn't so great and is underneath the camera.   Battery cover is flimsy.
8.0|#||#|Noise reduction too strong sometimes ( less NR could be option within picture controls)
7.0|#|very easy to use and full of features|#|Way too much in camera processing, pictures very soft and heaviliy smoothed in darker areas. Difficult to get a very crisp result. What a shame.

9.0|#|shoot on the easy mode, or do your own thing.  Good size window, to see your pics right away.  The buttons and dials are easy to operate, location of the buttons make sense.  I love the zoom, it is awesome, best one I've used without having to change lens.  The battery keeps it's charge for several days, very easy to recharge.  Has good energy saving features.  I haven't played with all the features yet, but so far it takes clear, focused, great color, quality pictures.|#|It is a little hard to hold while taking pictures.  An antiglare screen would be good.  It would be nice if it came with a case.
9.0|#|Excellent point and shoot camera with enough features to allow more experimental use. iPanorama is excellent. Very good image quality. Automatic mode produces excellent results.|#|Screen resolution could be better.
10.0|#|This camera is great. So easy to use and the picture quality is great. I usually use a digital SLR and was worried that a compact camera just wouldn't be the same...this is great though. I do love the panoramic sweep...what a great feature.|#|I can't think of any...it's a great little camera.
9.0|#|video from the same camera there is nothing better on the market, just buy the Sony HX5.|#|You'll need a spare battery from the off, as in particualr using video the charge drain quite quickly, but this is a minor concern.
9.0|#|Decent optical zoom, 1080i HD video, good 10.2m sensor, great low light performance, intelligent scene selection (mostly), sweep panorama feature, good battery life, good build quality, works with (cheapish) SD cards.|#|Not much, perhaps a bit chunky but produces better pics that the TX5 (IMHO).
9.0|#|Intelligent sweep panorama is one of my favourite features, the novelty still hasn't worn off. This is a very clever camera capable of shooting in many different difficult situations. Fits easily in my pocket instead of carrying lenses, flash guns etc. in a heavy SLR camera bag.|#|Would have liked a viewfinder too. GPS doesn't always get a signal and when it doesn't it uses the last one it had, I'd rather it record nothing in that situation. Sony don't have cases available for this camera yet in my region over a month after I bought the camera, and really they ought to provide a case with their products, it's a bit mean (though common practice nowadays) not to.
9.0|#|sharp. The zoom is excellent. Don't let the 10 meg. fool you. It takes better pictures than many 14 meg. cameras. I would recommend this camera to anyone.|#|
8.0|#|I am a Sony fan and can't help but buy their products, which are usually a bit more than competitors but don't offer much more.  This one however is bang on for the money, the Exmor sensor does what it says on the tin and it takes great low light pictures and the 10X zoom is plenty with good image stabilization. It compares well to the Panasonic in the same price bracket but that probably pips it on some pictures.  Overall it's an excellent, easy to use camera and a good all rounder.|#|The size is a bit bulky and the feel is sturdy but light, and so a little cheap feeling compared to similar Panasonic's.  Some mid light pictures seem to be on the orange side with darker backgrounds when the unit if left to auto modes, .owever the may be managed by white balance and other settings/

7.0|#|Very easy to use.  I like the way it will take 2 pictures when it is not sure which would be better e.g. with and without flash. GPS adds a real extra dimension to seeing the photos in context.  The moving images are of high quality. It is very easy to convert the files to a format that will go into a Power point presentation.  The panoramic shots are really good.  This is a really good camera to take on holiday.|#|The auto focus often seems to get it a bit wrong, with the result that what should be a really good image looks like it was taken on an instamatic.  Other reviews that have also identified problems with the overall quality of the pictures.

5.0|#|AVCHD works with Macs Final Cut Express, and iMovie really well. This is a great camcorder though the sound is pretty awful. Need to delete the autorun files on the camera to stop a little app on the camera launching when you connect it to a MAC, mail me for details.... you don't need it with iphoto, aperture or imovie, FCE.... !|#|Picture quality on photos is at best, poor, at worst, the quality is poorer than my iphone 3GS! The face recognition and smile detection cause other problems in low-ish light, where a red cast over takes the darker areas as the camera struggles to colour the photo properly. But the worst point is the rendering, here the camera renders the photo with a milky texture at 100% zoom, it's awful and totally unusable at anything over a standard 6x4 print. The lens has two F stops you can adjust, but I can't tell any difference in depth of field between them. So don't buy this if your thinking its going to compete with a SLR or decent bridge. Outside, for average snaps the camera is great, but that's all.

As you move the camera it just flows gently along.|#|can't think of any yet

Lack of full printed manual for reference: with so many modes can be hard to understand what they do/ how they work. Lack of manual control - those 'features' take over.
4.0|#|Zoom was OK|#|Image quality was pretty poor, especially photos taken at night or in poor light - looked really over exposed. Also, the lense cover stopped working within a couple of weeks - would not open or retract properly so ended up changing for a Fuji camera.
9.0|#|Sony have shoe horned so much technology and features into such a compact camera that it is simply astonishing if you understand what is involved.  The panoramic feature works beautifully, as does the burst, which is great if you want to get that one perfect shot of something involving movement, such as a child on a swing.  I also like being able to search for photos on the memory card using the built in calendar.|#|The only feature I have tested which didn't work well was the self-timer which fires once it recognises two faces, as it detected other objects as faces and fired immediately.  But you could still use the 10 second timer, so no issue really.

10.0|#|Easy to use. Small. Good Lens. Brilliant for twilight. Panoromic views.|#|battery could last a little longer
5.0|#|Video quality, advanced picture features.|#|Image quality poor due to noise correction software which gives unatural look to close detail.
9.0|#|It is small (but not too small), gives tremendous quality pictures (but I am no professional), is easy to use, has a good screen (although can be hard to see in bright sunlight). The panorama feature is superb and easy to use. The burst feature allows you t o take a sequence of a moving subject (like a child running) and pick the best one. Technically I think this is a great camera.|#|There are afew niggles - but all non-picture ones. At that price, to include a case specific to the model would be nice. The cover over the battery/card is pretty flimsy - certainly less sturdy than any other Sony product I have had. Now that Sony have moved to a camera that take multiple cards (their Memory  Stick, SD etc), the card slot is bigger and wider - so putting the card in is less easy than it might be and you have to take some care not to get the card stuck across the slot.

9.0|#|High quality stills and HD video in a pocket sized, easy-to-use unit.  Auto exposure and auto focus excellent.  Powerful zoom lens.  Built-in panorama function captures big landscapes with ease.  GPS data useful to log where outdoor pictures were taken.  Several special modes for backlit scenes, low light, etc.|#|Bundled software provides basic image and video editing, but more powerful software, e.g.MacBook's i-Movie necessary to produce professional videos with fades, sound track, post-production effects, titles, etc. Internal stereo microphone good, but no provision for external microphone for specialised work.  Beware covering left mic with fingers and hence losing a sound channel. Speed of video zoom can be controlled, but small lever makes precise control tricky. Does not seem to have a manual focus mode, though auto focus is very good.
9.0|#|The panorama feature is excellent - which is why I got it. However I was also pleasantly surprised by the ease of use of the intellgent auto function.|#|the single shot/multiple shot button is in the wrong place - its too easy to hit it by accident.

10.0|#|Briiliant wide angle of view compared to other cameras. Only one picture needed to get all of a room.Ease of use now I am used to waiting for the GPS bars to appear so that I know it is logged in. The Movie system is excellant.  I have still not worked out how to get the full panarama view, I either move to fast or not enough so it is only Operater Fault not the camera.  I love the green automatic focus indicator . The hand held twilight has given me some good photos. Brilliant colours and picture quality. I have previous Cameras and this one leaves them standing in every part.|#|Not knowing where the GPS control is on the top or side of the camera as I do not know exactly where to put my hands so that I do not obstruct it.  Screen cover extremely expensive  for a bit of plastic, but I intend to save up for one.
8.0|#|Lots of features, metal casing, good optical zoom|#|inadequate focus point control, low light images show signs of heavy or over-processing by in-camera software.

9.0|#|iSweep Panorama, stabilisation, amazing HD footage, great 10x optical zoom and an awesome wide angle lens.   The fact you can now use SDHC cards in it now.  Really great low level light shooting.  Really light and compact considering the amount of features that it possesses.  The GPS when used in conjunction with applications like Aperture is truly brilliant and probably the main reason for buying.  All in all a joy to use.|#|White balance isn't that accurate and I have to change the settings myself.  Battery life when shooting in HD goes down very quickly, although you can now buy separate a more high powered battery, but it would have been nice if it had come with the camera.  The microphone on the camera for the HD video could do with a wind shield somehow built into it as the slightest bit of wind causes distortion on the footage.  Also a high tenacity microphone could be good when shooting at live music venues would be really useful.
8.0|#|Large range of features. Sweep panorama and gps are great to have in a pocket camera.|#|Image quality. Too strong noise suppression degrades detail too much.
5.0|#|Very good flash image quality.|#|
9.0|#|GPS and panorama. I didn't think I would use the panorama but now I am sold on it. Very easy to use. You need to take time with the GPS , so that it picks up the location. When the camera is connected to the PC the GPS is updated for faster locating.|#|Everytime I take the camera out of its case or from my pocket I change the picture mode selector, this is only a very minor problem but stops fast shooting. I could do with a waterproof version for English summers.
8.0|#|shot despite the quality - panoramic photos are quite awkward in terms of use (i.e. printing, using on the internet) however for a large scene  has its benefits. GPS is excellent to pin point exactly where a photo was taken- great for holiday pictures or those taken out of town - despite usually knowing where you take  a photo (as you were actually there) its great to use the programme like PMB which allows you to view a map showing where your photo was taken,.|#|Very bulky and overpriced for  a digital camera - the fact it has GPS and panoramic sweep probably allow it to be this way which aren't the most useful features, yet the quality is very good.
7.0|#|Good pictures.|#|Very complex and complicated to use. In bright sunlight the screen was of no use whatsoever, A TTL would be better.
8.0|#|I love the panaramic option - that is why I bought the camera. Note - crop the picture before sharing it with others.|#|It's hard to see the picture in full sunlight (I had hoped it would be better than my very old Olympus - it is - but it is not as good as I would have liked).

The features like smile and blink detection are cool too.|#|The array of features and shoot options are vast, which for someone who likes to point and shoot is a little frustrating... but I'm learning and the more I use it the more I love it.
10.0|#|It takes good action shots and good pictures in poor light. It's got a large screen and it's really easy to use, as well as being light and easy to carry around. It's easy to remove the memory stick to download pics and easy to recharge. The battery lasts a long time.|#|I really have nothing to say here...
10.0|#|Great zoom, takes sharp well balanced pictures.|#|Sometimes movie button placement can be hit accidentally.
10.0|#|Image quality especially HD video. Also have the large 3 ccd FX1 video camera. The HX5, in good light conditions, is almost as good as the very expensive semi-pro camcorder.|#|Newer models available but on the other hand the HX5 is now at rock bottom price.
9.0|#|Easy to use, good features that actually work, image quality perfect for normal size print-outs, stereo sound in video, PMB software bundle useful|#|None so far
9.0|#|the video's are good - but I didn't buy a still camera for video, so thats not important to me.|#|The camera is let down slightly by poor in-camera image processing and slightly poor build quality. The images look good initially, but, when you look closer, you see that you have lost detail, especially in solid colours. This is not a problem if you are just using the supplied software (which is very good) to look at your images on a PC. Not so good, however, if you were hoping to crop/zoom into an image. Others have mentioned the poor quality of the battery door and I'd agree with them, it is flimsy.
8.0|#|So many great features. In particular -GPS tagging, HD Video, panorama and very good in low light conditions.|#|You have to remove the battery to charge it. Shame it doesn't charge in the camera when connected to USB.
7.0|#|Plenty of features and ease of handling.|#|No paper Manual, had to buy one seperately.
6.0|#||#|Slow start-up and shutdown
9.0|#|Extremely easy to use. Takes really good pictures even in quite low lighting levels. The Movie quality really is incredible; much better then the pictures I get from my high branded dedicated Video Cam-recorder. This was probably the most surprising, and pleasing, aspect of the camera which I bought really for taking still photographs not really thinking that the Video element would be that brilliant.|#|None noticed to date. The only thing I would perceive as being a potential issue in the future is the battery/Flash Card cover, which feels a little flimsy.
10.0|#|Lightweight, sturdy, flexible and beautiful images|#|None
10.0|#||#|It only comes black and silver! (and the silver ones are much harder to get hold of and slightly more expensive!)
9.0|#|Zoom is awesome IF you can keep the camera steady. Sweep panorama works great, but it's tempting to overuse it. Movies are good quality. Battery life is better than I expected.|#|With so many features, it deserves to have a printed full manual, not just a starter guide and on-disk version.
8.0|#|A solid camera that does everything a point and shoot camera should do, and it does them very well. The on-screen information in the manual mode are a good way to pick up the basic tips for the more advanced settings and encourages you to have a play around with them - improving your skills behind the camera.|#|As with most Sony products they try to build their own software for use on your computer - this isn't usually very good. But the simple solution is that you can opt to not use it and just import them into whatever program you use, i.e. iPhoto, Picasa or Aperture.

10.0|#|shoot camera, with gps and high quality images. Also full HD video.  Panorama feature is very useful. Nice to handle. Software supplied works very well. An all in one solution for a pocket travel camera, replacing our former 5MP Optio camera and camcorder.|#|Can't think of any.
8.0|#|Both very good stills images and AVCHD quality video, so you don't need to carry a dedicated video cam. Goods options in the setting up of the camera and scene choices. Quick to start with responsive focus and zoom. Good level of optical zoom at 10x and this can also be used in AVCHD recording, which some other cameras don't allow. Stylish and compact. Good flash performance. Easy point and shoot camera, or options to be more inventive if desired. GPS is an interesting touch.|#|Stereo microphones for video poorly located, as dificult to avoid figures covering these when holding the camera - makes for an awkward grip on the camera. Spot focus option is not as constrained as it should be, as focus field runs outside of the box. Sometimes the GPS gets it wrong, and can also be sluggish to respond. Battery performance isn't bad, but could be better and slow to charge - option to improve with separate upgrades. Would have been nice is the latter formed part of the original spec!

8.0|#|Panoramic pictures.Burst shooting.|#|Unable to sync video footage to Mac computer.
7.0|#|The HD video is excellent, the GPS location if using the camera regularly is quick.  The panoramic function is superb.   10 megapixels could be better but the image quality is lovely, and when you get the camera in manual modes you can be a bit more creative.  Depth of field is limiting, but you can get around this using zoom and flash and the camera produces good images.  Battery seems to have a nice long life so far.|#|The location of the quick record video button is wrong, its all to easy when gripping the camera to press the shutter you accidently squeeze the video button, so you miss you photo and end up with a video clip you don't want.  Very annoying on action shots. The microphones are located where you naturally grip the camera so you end up covering up one, so stereo sound is effected in video mode.  If you don't use the camera for a long time, the first GPS boot up is quite slow.  The cable supplied is hideous too many connections on the one wire.

10.0|#|Great featues and abilty to control the camera or let it work things out for itself. I am impressed with the handheld twilight setting and the resulting pictures which are surprisingly sharp. I am also impressed with the intelligent panorama technology.|#|So far my only real gripe is that the intelligent panorama uses significantly lower resolution in the resulting image than the camera is capable of. I would have hoped that it would use its full vertical resolution, but in fact it only uses a third of the vertical resolution.
9.0|#|Good results are quite easy to obtain. Reasonably lightweight.|#|The mode selector dial is far too easy to accidentally more to a different setting. I specifically bought this for the GPS functionality although it is a little difficult to know when the GPS has updated correctly when you turn on the camera in a new location - I might have to reread the manual on that one.

9.0|#|This camera is a revelation, if you go out with friends or family for the day and take photo's and AVCHD or MPEG 4 video with this camera, then on returning home connect the camera to a LCD  or Plasma TV with an HDMI lead, you and your friends and family will  be flown away at the quality of the images and virtually broadcast qality video. Before purchase I compared this camera photo to photo and vidoe to video with it's major competitors ( Panasonic, Canon, etc) and this camera won hands down. Just buy it, it's a no brainer.|#|It's a bit of a pain using AVCHD video capture if you want to give a copy of the video to friends to play on thier computer as most standard video players or camera image display software do not recognise AVCHD , for instance Windows Media Player and Picasa. Their are two ways round this, either record in MPEG 4 which is still very good and this can be easily converted or use the suppled PMB software from SONY and convert the AVCHD video and burn it to a recordable DVD to play on a domestic DVD player. Don't let this minor irritation put you off as I understand the latest Window 7 software allows for a cpdec to be downloaded from Microsoft to view AVCHD video from you camera.
9.0|#|Easy to use and change settings.   Very good zoom range.  Steady shot excellent.  Easy to switch from photo to video.  Excellent lens produces quality results.  Majority of DSLR users could switch to this camera for 99% of their needs.|#|Microphone for video is very poor.  Camera needs a remote control for video use, and an input for an external microphone.  Could have had better build quality vis a vis dust and water.
8.0|#|The panorama function is excellent.|#|Poor sharpness.
8.0|#|Zoom is also a strong feature.|#|Have found the main reason for purchasing the camera which is the panorama capability to be slightly a slightly disappointing feature as is the GPS which does not work particularly well as the reliance on google maps fails more than it works.
9.0|#|I love the burst mode, the panoramic is good fun too. The camera feels really good and responds fast.  I feel very happy that i chose to get a better quality camera with a higher price than i would normally pay,  I am more than impressed by the difference.|#|I also think it would be better if you could move the microphone along nearer the burst mode button, the safest place( to avoid dropping the camera) to hold it with my left hand is exactly where the mic is.
9.0|#|low light sensor - makes night time images really clear|#|time lag on GPS - don't have time to wait for GPS data to update when taking many pics so end up with wrong location on file
9.0|#|The quality of the images, and ease of use. I have moved to this from a Canon DSLR, and don't feel the camera is lacking. The panoramic shots are amazing.|#|The GPS service can be slow to update, so some images are tagged as being taken from a previous location. The GPS assist software which improves the speed of location is not designed for Mac computers. There are workarounds, but they are a little bit fiddly. The camera warns about recording data to the memory card every time I turn it on, because I bought an 8GB card. I contacted the manufacturer, who told me this is nothing to worry about.

10.0|#|This camera is easy to use and lovely to hold. The image quality is good and the HD movie feature is like having a camera and video camera in one.

So you end up putting your fingers over them.

5.0|#||#|I have two issues with the camera (1) the main reason I picked the HX5V is the GPS capability but it is very slow to pick up the position ... it can be very slow in a completely new area.  (2) Whilst I knew about this, in afterthought I'm disappointed that the camera uses the propriety Sony memory cards.

Screen a little hard to see in the sun on holiday - on a few occasions had to take a load on burst mode pointing vaguely in the right direction - screens are still no substitute for a viewfinder.

The Zoom gearing is too high and care must be taken to get a smooth slow zoom so practice lots before using the video mode.  Battery cover is a bit flimsey.

Battery lasts a good while between charges, and takes a good number of photos before needing recharge.|#|When holding the camera it is easy to obscure one of the stereo microphones and it possible to unintentionally operate other buttons like burst mode or video, but guess thats just as its so small. Cost of Sony camera case was quite expensive in comparison to the camera itself.
10.0|#|The sweep panorama was the initial driver for wanting this camera and after getting one as a 40th birthday present I was not disappointed.  This mode takes stunning pictures.  The low light functionality is also very very good, great zoom and stable images.  I like the one touch buttons for single/burst and for recording video, saves fiddling in menus to set the mode up.|#|The function dial could do with being a touch harder to rotate as I have found I have knocked it from my desired mode between pictures just by slipping it back in a case or with my hand.

10.0|#|Absolutely fab camera to use and love the panaramic sweep feature. The quality of the twilight shots is also excellent. Its very easy to use and each image is stored super quick so you can continue snapping away!|#|Not come across any!
9.0|#|Ease of use, size of screen|#|Impossible to see what you are trying to photograph in bright sunlight.  I found myself just pointing and shooting and hoping for the best.  Battery cover very flimsy.
10.0|#|When you change the settings they come up on the screen large enough for me not have to use my reading glasses - always a plus!  The quality of the images have been very good.  The intelligent digital zoom setting works well - it increases the maximum zoom a bit without much pixilation.|#|This is probably as much to do with my technique than the camera as all my previous cameras have had view finders as well as a screen, but I find that the act of pressing the shutter can move the camera just a little bit which can ruin a carefully composed photo.
10.0|#|Excellent IA image quality and ease of use|#|Battery a little fiddly to remove and insert. Image transfer software poor for Mac OSX
9.0|#|I enjoy using the HX5V. It has excellent features and functions, the quality of the photos and video is very good and it is lighter and smaller than its rivals. The Intelligent Auto mode works very well and I'm very impressed with the HD video.|#|The  GPS doesn't produce the functionality I expected.  I thought and hoped that the location (ie the name of the town) would be displayed when taking a photo.  If not, perhaps the location would be clearly shown when the pictures have been downloaded to my computer.  What actually happens is :-  a) A compass is displayed on the screen when taking a picture. b) The map reference can be found in the file properties after the picture has been downloaded. c) By running PMB software on each photo a map can be displayed showing the location.  Disappointing.

6.0|#|Reasonably attractive appearance|#|Too much installed manufacturer software which is not intuitive to customise or remove. There is nothing about this that laptop that makes it really distinctive from its competitors

10.0|#|great easy to use camera giving you the function to also play with a cameras settings. isweep panaramic feature is awesome|#|
8.0|#|Panoramic feature is easy to use and offers a very good quality picture that would not be achieved with a stitch. Size and weight together with body moulding make the camera very ergonomically sound.|#|Zoom s not as good as I had hoped for especially in comparison to my Kodak 10x unit that this camera replaced.
9.0|#|Small enough to be put in  a jacket pocket. Simple to use. Excellent results|#|Selection dial is easily rotated so needs checking before shooting.  Would prefer a hard copy of the instructions

8.0|#|Large screen|#|Battery discharges fairly quicky when camera is not in use.
9.0|#|Build quality is very solid. The features are fantastic, in particular the hand-held twilight and panorama modes. Video quality is astounding in full HD with decent sound for a compact. Operation is very simple, but you have a reasonable amount of control if you want, and the lens covers a very good range for general use, inc travel. Picture quality is always good (for a compact) with bright colours. The results produced in low light are the best of any camera in this class. Battery life is good, but I recommend you carry a spare.|#|The control dial on the top is too easily turned when putting the camera in/removing from a pocket or pouch so you have to check the setting each time before use otherwise you can end up getting an unusable shot. There's no control over noise reduction and even at the lowest ISO in bright light the NR smudges out details. As long as you don't zoom in to 100% you'll never have to worry though so it's only a problem for pixel peepers or extreme cropping. It's a shame they don't make an underwater case for it as with the superb low-light performance it would be a great camera for scuba diving.

9.0|#|Very nice camera which does everything I require.  HD video mode is excellent as is the burst feature when taking action shots.  I find the image quality very crisp and clear and can't fault it.  Build quality is very good and it feels robust.  Overall a very good camera.|#|No memeory card or case

7.0|#|Panoramic shooting mode is good. Video mode is good but it was bought as a stills camera not as a video camera.|#|Despite trying many different functions on the camera, and having purchased it largely for GPS and image quality, the image quality is also worse than expected. The images are not very sharp, when the flash is used they are often washed out etc.

I also took some Movies , the HD quality is great. I anyone is buying i would definitely recommend this.|#|DSCHX5V has GPS its of great use, and also the ease of use isn't very helpful.
10.0|#|It has everything anyone would want to make the best photos possible for everyday use. The settings help to catch the best photo whatever the environment, occasion or activity.|#|Needs more mega pixels for more detailed photos something like 15.

10.0|#|iSweep is fantastic. Doesn't duplicate moving people even in fast moving situations. Plenty of options. Easy mode is very easy for non-technical people. HD videos work well once you have the right card. Build quality overall is excellent. Sony Picture Book Manager is much better than the bloatware Sony used to package with their cameras.|#|iSweep's quality of picture isn't as good as a standard picture. Dual purpose SD / MS slot makes it a little tricky (but not difficult) to insert Sony MS cards. Sometimes difficult not to press buttons while opening bottom case. Manual on CD rather than printed (Quick Start guide is printed).
9.0|#|Good size screen. Very fast shutter speed|#|
9.0|#|Overall excellent camera and value of rmoney.|#|Sometimes displays an error message on screen - this card may not record - but then it is able to use the card anyway! I bought a new card as I thought that the message means that my old Mem Stick DUO was not good. In fact the old one is as good as the new one. I could have saved on buying the new card if the message did not appear in the first place.
10.0|#|Very compact so it's easily portable. Controls are pretty much intuitive. Simple to link to a computer for file transference.|#|Controls are slightly fiddly - which can't be helped on a product of this size - and probably difficult to operate with chunky fingers.
10.0|#|Very easy to use. Professional looking results at the press of a button. Excellent spec for a consumer camera. More spec and you'd be into a DLR.  HD video quality it reproduces is amazing.|#|Low light HD movie quality is poor. Focus during movie recording can sometimes hunt around.

9.0|#|Excellent zoom facility. Panoramic feature is very easy to use and is useful. Burst mode is also good. Full HD video is extremely high quality even at full zoom. The camera has a solid weighty feel and the battery is more than enough for a full days worth of shots. HDMI interface to a TV is easy to use.|#|Over exposes pictures in very sunny/bright conditions (this can be prevented by setting a negative exposure manually). Picture quality could be better. As long as you don't print out a picture at full size and view them on a TV or PC monitor the quality is excellent. It's only if you view at 100% that the graininess is apparent. Switching on GPS drains the battery quite quickly.

10.0|#|Great Panorama, great camera for the price.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|Very easy to use, it is very compact, clear pictures and the 3ins screen is very good.|#|the only thing is there is no yiew finder and when it's sunny you can't see whats on the screen.
8.0|#|great quality images, from a relatively inexpensive little camera. the sony sweep is a great feature!|#|grainy results from the sweep function. The switch where you change function is very poor build quality and looks like it will be the first thing to break
8.0|#|So user friendly. The image quality is amazing. The panorama shots are great. The videoing with auto-focus is an absolute treat.|#|Taking the battery out to recharge it, seems a little tiring. When you press the shutter button, it seems too slow to respond.

10.0|#|Light and compact, excellent panoramic facility, with superb picture quality. I patiicuarly like the ability to utilize both Memory Stick and SD cards.|#|No Viewfinder, making the screen difficult to read in bright conditions. I would prefer to see some hard ware buttons for some controls, rather than going through several menus. Also a mask to appear on the parts of the screen when using Panoramic mode, to blank non usable area of screen. This would mak composition easier.

9.0|#|Managed to get sand inside the lens while using the camera on holiday.  Half the shutter would not open for the rest of the day, but by the next day the camera had corrected itself and the lens/photos do not seem to be scratched or affected at all. The camera was only one week old when this happened so we were very pleased that it managed to correct itself.|#|

9.0|#|Love the landscape picture facility, something I use often|#|Not found any yet.......
10.0|#|I bought this camera for the sweep panorama function, and it has proved to be excellent for capturing wide panoramic views, though the width of the image is quite thin. The large LCD screen is of good quality and makes excellent viewing, and the photos are of excellent quality. A large range of modes for shooting under different light/environment conditions is also good. Nice small compact shape.|#|Bit of shame that it didn't come with a camera case specifically for this design but I knew it wasn't going to so it was fine.
9.0|#|The styling is sleek. It is small enough to fit easily in your pocket and the viewing screen is bigger than most, with a good menu which is easy to use. The panoramic shooting is excellent, a nice touch.|#|Although it has the ability to record in HD, you have to purchase an expensive memory card which supports this, so I will not be using this function.
9.0|#|Easy to use, light, good pictures|#|Perhaps it's me - as you take more pictures the images I attach to emails get smaller
9.0|#|Small enough to fit in pocket, wide angle lens lets me get all the people and buildings in without moving miles away, and it has a panoramic option which is simple to use and works well with landscape photos.|#|Not many bad points, sometime the quality isn't brilliant, especially on dark subjects, but it is only a compact, and is an all round decent camera.

10.0|#|Compact and easy to slip into your pocket|#|Can never find any with the products
8.0|#||#|CONS: The biggest con is by far the ridiculous tunnel effect (put your emails down and I will send you a couple samples) in ALL pictures at the edges. What I mean is that everything at the right or left of the pictures (when viewed horizontally) is rounded off. This means that taking a vertical picture of a tall building will make it look like a blown up sail. If you have a close up of a face or a full body vertical picture it seems you are looking through a spyglass. The intelligent mode (main shooting mode) is really quite bad as it usually selects landscape or backlight in all conditions except when you are trying to set up the camera on tripod at which it will chose the the tripod or macro option (when your hand is in front of the lens, really annoying!). Unfortunately you're stuck with that because there are limited shooting options in the program mode (My old Nikon coolpix from 2005 had more options...). Also the zoom is very limited as it cannot go beyond 4x but at least the pictures look nice at that distance. Last, filimg underwater will always have this weird white noise sound all the time...
9.0|#|The TX5 is very easy to use and has numerous useful features. I have found picture quality on photo and movie mode to be excellent at 10M, but other picture quality and size can be selected. LCD brightness can be increased for use in sunny conditions. Camera is a nice size and feels robust. I had done a lot of research before buying this camera as I specifically needed a waterproof camera and so I am very pleased with the camera which is perfect for my general day out/holiday use.|#|Touch screen can get messy with fingerprints but I guess that's to be expected and can be cleaned easily. Sound on movie mode not excellent but it meets my needs for short movie clips.
9.0|#|The water proof feature is great for pictures in the pool. Video clarity is great too. The low light sensor is good at taking pics in the evening.|#|For such a all weather camera I have managed to chip the paintwork in a week of being on holiday.
9.0|#|Size|#|Because it is so small, and the shutter is located in the top corner, your finger sometimes gets in the picture. You just have to hold it differently then you would another point and shoot camera.
9.0|#|Have not used it underwater.|#|shoot camera / video it's great
9.0|#|I highly recommend this product for someone who wants nice holiday pictures with a small camera that fits into the smallest pockets or handbags! Starts up quickly and it is a cool gadget and that's it!|#|I was scared to use the camera under water because the manual said that after use i need to rinse the machine in clean water for at least 5 minutes. I couldn't carry a bowl and plenty of water for this task, so I left it.
9.0|#|Optics are amazing for a camera this size|#|Whole back of the camera is touch screen, and I haven't found a screen lock function. Probably easy to make with firmware upgrade, hopefully they do.
8.0|#||#|Well - and the usual Sony obsession with recognizing smiles of various degrees are a little bit funny. But charming, in a way.
8.0|#|easy to use in all modes|#|The coloured cover is starting to become removed from the camera case, making the green colour into silver. Plastic lifting after underwater use.
10.0|#|It waterproof, amazing quailty photos, some awesome features, due memory card capabilities and it looks good!|#|can be a little slow but with a bigger memory card it works better
9.0|#|The ease of use, the fact that it´s resistant is the best!, I can take pictures in the water, at the beach...|#|A little too pricey I guess
9.0|#|Attractive design, responsive touch screen|#|Weight and smoothness make it difficult to hold, finger tends to get in front of lens.
8.0|#|Water and dust proof.|#|Touch screen not always immediately reactive.
9.0|#|Small, feels robust, with good spec. Quick start-up and takes picture instantly, which is great for action shots. Variable rapid shoot is very useful too. Great camera.|#|Lens close to corner too, so fingers sometimes cover the picture. Need to get used to the best holding position, I guess.
10.0|#|Everything I was looking for in a small easy to use camera..|#|None
8.0|#|Early models that exhibited peeling of the paint from the front cover can now get their cameras repaired free of charge by Sony, so reviews citing this as a negative point are no longer valid.|#|You get lots of finger prints on the screen due to the touch screen operation!
9.0|#|shoot mode. great build quality for the price too|#|quite a few shots get the finger in the picture when holding for the first time , but you soon get used to how to use.
6.0|#|slim, good ideas for features, smile detection quite brilliant.|#|images not as good as my 5 year old 5mp canon powershot. especially low light, which is supposedly one of the selling points.
10.0|#|Absolutely great pics for a point and shoot camera. Waterproof feature is good for the beach and pool. I really like using this camera. Ergonomically super!|#|
10.0|#|Really easy to use, excellent quality underwater photos, like the panorama feature. Sound quality on video recording good as well.|#|
8.0|#||#|- The design means that when holding the camera, it is easy to cover part of lens with finger. it is an issue especially when you give it to someone to take images
9.0|#|Easy to slip in your pocket. Excellent all rounder for still shots to video camera. Covers all aspects of photography from amatuer to the advanced photographer.|#|Lens too close to the top corner of the camera, if your not careful your fingers can cover part of the lens. Cable connection to camera to close to battery cover.
10.0|#|A Fantastic all round compact camera. Brilliant for using outdoors and versatile. Sweep panorama feature is excellent for scenic shots and the HD movie function provides great results.|#|None really. Only slight concern is the ease at which you can catch the touch control screen if you aren't careful.
10.0|#|Compact and easy to use, this camera is excellent for its size.  The smile detect works brilliantly and the sweep panorama beats stitching images together on the pc.  In automatic mode the camera switches easily between macro and distance settings and the scene detect works fantastically.  It is easy to select point of focus using the touch screen, and the touch screen itself works smoothly. I have rarely had to use manual settings except when suppressing flash. The flash is powerful for its size and can cope with indoor pictures across a room.  HD movies are good quality.  I have never enjoyed taking photos so much as I have with this camera.|#|The battery is OK for taking pictures, but it drains more quickly when using it for movies or editing, still it seems to work pretty well on full charge and with smart technology can be topped up (out of camera) before it has fully drained.  The only thing I don't like about battery charging is that a full charge is one hour after the light goes out on the charger - but who wants to sit and watch what time it goes out?
9.0|#|dedicated movie button thats easy to use. excellent features such as the sweep panorma and blurred background mode. full HD movie is awesome, greeat connectivity as well straight to a HD tv|#|
9.0|#|Great little camera with clever features that are easy to use and don;t get in the way of simply taking good photos. That it is also waterproof is a real bonus.|#|You have to take the battery out to charge it, which I always find annoying. And I'm worried about how robust the battery cover is, but we'll see.
9.0|#|Nice size, waterproof feature is fantastic if you have children or an active lifestyle. The panoramic feature is really good!|#|The battery cover feels a little flimsy for a waterproof product
9.0|#|Very compact and light.  Intuitive menu system.  Touch-screen is accurate and easy to use.  Fast start-up and shutter response.  Haven't tested the waterproofing or drop-proof capabilities, yet.|#|Gaining access to the USB plug is rather fiddly and awkward.
9.0|#||#|no manual to follow-had to print one online-prefer to have instructions at hand
9.0|#|GOOD INTERFACE, FEATURES AND TOUCH SCREEN|#|
10.0|#|Very easy to use. Purchased the camera for the sweep panarama feature, and I was not disappointed. Picture quality and ease of use on the sweep panarama is excellent. I also like the scene recognition feature, saves the bother of finding the right configuration for each particular shot.|#|Can't use zoom on the sweep panarama.  Would like to have some sort of built in photo editing features. ie: cropping. A DC input to charge the battery in the camera. And also to stop battery from draining whilst downloading photos to computer.
9.0|#|It really does look too good to be waterproof! (previously had a waterproof camera that was much more like a brick!)|#|The only real thing that bothers me the most about this camera is that yes there are different settings and scene selections, i feal that there wasnt many things for me to play around with and have fiddle with, although for many people this is an advantage as there is everything you need with one menu basically.
10.0|#|Very solid camera, photo quality is excellent. Went to a concert with it and the quality of snaps made in dark, from a distance were incredible. Similarly, the panoramic function is breathtaking when used for the first time. Highly recommend.|#|Cost (obviously). Despite this being the slimmest waterproof camera on the market, my older camera (which admittedly was not waterproof) was slimmer. However, I have little doubt that this specification will improve in future iterations. The memory card being a Sony Pro Duo one is a bit of a pain as my laptop does not accept it.
10.0|#|Simple and easy to use camera. A big LCD touch screen is bug plus point. Image quality as expectd from Sony.|#|Does not stamp date on the pictures. My old Kodak used to do that. Otherwise no bad point.

9.0|#|Excellent build and image quality.|#|Battery life isn't fantastic.
10.0|#|VERY GOOD ALL ROUND CAMERA|#|
9.0|#|Super slim, lightweight and easy to use.  Excellent for video as records in HD and since it will take SD memory cards its capacity is up to whatever gig you want to put in.  Used it for snorkelling and got fantastic video and stills - waterprooof without a case to 10ft.  For divers, the underwater pack is fairly compact and easy to use. Experienced underwater photographers may want to ignore the underwater setting for stills and just manually over-ride/use the white balance features.  Underwater setting for video produced great results, especially in water that is cloudy or has a lot of plankton. If there is a camera flood, because it is already waterproof to 10ft it could mean that the camera survives rather than gets trashed owing to the salt water damage.|#|Smudging on the touch-screen is inevitable so buy screen protectors.  Also watch out where fingers are while shooting - the small size of the camera means that fingers and thumbs can end up on the top of the picture.
9.0|#|Its Very Light Metallic Green.|#|No memory included in Box.
8.0|#|small size.|#|Would not use without wrist strap. Have to be careful not to let a finger of left hand obscure lens. Would like a longer life battery.
10.0|#|We bought this camera for our 11yr old daughter who enjoys taking photos.  It is very straightforward to use and takes fantastic pictures - especially the extreme close up function.  She's loved using the paint and edit effect tool on the touch screen on the camera.  The touchscreen is simple and clear to use.  Easy to download straight into iPhoto or other similar app.  It lives up to its product reviews on the web and was great value.  She hasn't tried it out underwater yet but on current showing was an excellent dual function choice.|#|
10.0|#|This camera is so easy to use - even my Mam can use it! The fact that you can use it under water and it can stand being dropped is fantastic - although neither of these features have been tested by me yet.|#|I can't say anything bad about this product

9.0|#|Great image and video quality. Underwater use is a huge advantage even if you don't use it underwater, at least you don't have to worry about getting in wet. Nice sturdy feel in your hand. Intelligent Auto function does everything for you, just point and shoot for great pictures. Sweep panorama is awesome. Really good camera.|#|Screen could be tougher, found i got some scratches on it although this doesn't affect the overall performance. Touch screen could be a little better, found I sometimes hit the adjacent button to the one i wanted.  Not as good as the touch screen you would find on an Apple product for example, but again, only a minor nuisance.

As an advanced amateur  I have used medium format film cameras and I am surprised and happy that Sony NEX -3AS produces images of the quality that I used to get with medium format cameras of not too large enlargements.  I use the wide angle lense only that gives me superb pictures.|#|I would have liked to see the battery power much greater.
9.0|#|Good thing about it was the setting of RAW for me.|#|I bought it as I thought it would be a good camera to put into my pocket but found it was quite bulky. The RAW setting was great but I was not able to use it with the software I had as I had DNG on my bigger camera, but this one uses ARW, so you have to keep switching from the software you get with it and my other software to use for the DNG.The on off switch could be better as when I put it into the camera bag it sometime accidently switches it self on.

8.0|#|flexibility and ease of use|#|The glass viewfinder is very vulnerable. I use my camera a lot and keep it in a case on my rucksack waistbelt for quick access. Over time the coating on the viewfinder wore off and the glass is now becoming scuffed and scratched. It would be helpful if Sony could issue the cameras with a plastic protective film when you purchase the camera.

8.0|#|Very clear images.  Panoramic feature. Easy to follow instructions|#|Can't attach lens cover to camera so real danger of losing it.  In order to zoom you have to buy a separate lens. I wanted this camera to take on holiday to South Africa.  I visited a camera shop in Port Elizabeth to enquire about buying the zoom lens and was informed by the proprietor that because the cost of this lens was so high he was refusing to stock this particular camera.
1.0|#|very compact, available lenses are of superb quality|#|Tel Sony technical who say this is normal!
7.0|#|It is compact but the quality of pics is stunning. The menu button is easy to access . Lenses are good built quality and look stylish. Size of the camera is good for travelling.|#|The remote / wired shutter control is missing, which is quite surprise to me as I'm a Sony fans and owned many Sony products. Didn't expect NEX3 not even have wired shutter control. It was a bit disappointed tbh. The accessories are expensive. The Sel18200 is around £700 that put people off to buy.
9.0|#|weight|#|lens could be better
8.0|#||#|Acess to functions too fiddly - Prefer ordinary mount for 'flash rather than awkward present system, also one would be able to use an ordinary spirit level or viewfinder. Adaptor for 'A' mount lenses too expensive, comparede to a Leica M mount adaptor which was purchased for under £40 new and which is fine.
10.0|#|This camera is great for newbies to photography, but has loads of hi-tech adjustments and settings for the advanced user as well. Takes amazing pictures and has lots of settings to choose from for special shoots!|#|It has a bit of a new age digital menu selection for photo settings, people who learned on an old school camera may not like because you have to go into the menu to change the settings and cannot just adjust via exterior buttons or scrolls.

9.0|#|Having owned a DSLR a100 previously, I was pleased to see that the make has evolved and no longer use the CF system with the awful pins that can easily be damaged. This camera works equally as well as the a100 but has so many new or refined features, the most obvious being the ability to switch to live view if needed. The results I obtain from this camera are identical to those from the a100 and are excellent when viewed on a large screen, clean, crisp and as sharp as the lens will allow. Using top quality lenses I have had some superb shots and find that some of the older Minolta lenses are as good as (if not better) than the ones supplied with the camera bodies. All-in-all a superb camera for the keen amateur, student or even the semi-professional who needs to use more than one camera and who wants to find an affordable but good professional DSLR.|#|No real bad points as the camera was bought after making an informed decision after looking at all its good points.
9.0|#|Light weight,relatively easy to use.Lots of features many of which I still have to explore.Really pleased with the baby pictures I took,so was the Mum,super quality.|#|Some of the function are buttons are a bit easy to press by mistake,but thats proberbly this operators fault not the cameras.
8.0|#|I went for the Alpha series because on trying in shops it fitted so well in my hands, and so it has consistently proved in use. Build quality is better than I expected, seems quite robust enough. In particular the 18-70mm zoom, beyond the usual 55mm, makes framing and composition significantly easier. Image quality is fine, and free of blur even when shooting in low light (e.g. indoors) without flash. Very happy.|#|The only minor oddity is that the autofocus keeps trying to operate even when the lens cap is on  can't imagine on what it is seeking to focus! Remedy is simple: switch to manual focus while not shooting.
10.0|#|3) Good quality of the resulting pictures.|#|Difficult to find any fault with such a great piece of kit!

9.0|#|Ease of use, flexibility of SLR. If you can find the A390K, it comes with an 18 - 70mm lens for the same price as the A390L (18 - 55mm)|#|Lack of panarama feature.
9.0|#|easy to use as there is several pre sets to use while I learn more about DSRL camera's. Fully Auto is great and up and running straight out the box(well as soon as battery charged). Overall very impressed. I Have found a few features I did not know were on the camera. If you are using the view finder it automatically turns of the LCD screen when you put the camera to your eye. I know the more experienced photographers are probably having a good chuckle, but we all have to start somewhere, it's my first DSLR. I'm sure I'll find more as I get time to use it. The anti shake do dah is in the camera not the lens so the additional lenses are cheaper than some other makes. I am looking forward to spending more time learning as soon as people stop finding me stuff to do.. Seriously After a couple of months I am more impressed than I thought I would be, As an introductory camera of this type I think it covers it. When I win the lottery, I've seen a nice one around 2.5 grand. (OK stop laughing)|#|Thought the battery did not last long, but it maybe it needs a few charging cycles to get up to full charge, some of these types of batteries do. Or It's more likely using full auto and a fair amount of flash is a major cause. Damn going to work in the dark and coming home in the dark. Also the the CPU is a little dated but so am I. Anyway they are out of date as soon as they are shipped from the manufacturer these days. If you have a limited income and mine is this year, thanks to my lovely daughter getting married, the lenses still seem expensive at the moment. I can dream though.
7.0|#|Very pleased with optical resolution of lens and anti-shake facility. The camera body is sturdy enough and the rear screen is quite good in bright light. The viewfinder is good - a little dim but seems to cover nearly all the picture coverage. The built in flash is good enough for normal indoor use. Bought as end - of - line bargain so when I found out Minolta were behind the camers I took the plunge.|#|Standard zoom lens is poor plastic and is very jerky in moving from 18 through to 55. Although the optical quality is very good, the lens is a let-down compared to the camera. Built in flash needs damping when released from the body! Also very sensitive pre-flash fires when touching the trigger!
10.0|#|Absolutely brilliant camera and user friendly for any new DSLR users!|#|

9.0|#|Very easy to use and comfortable to hold.  I use it as a light-weight second camera mainly for walking. The picture quality is perfectly acceptable for holiday shots and informal photography.  If you want anything better, be prepared to pay far more for a semi-professional camera.  The live view is easy to use but I prefer to use the viewfinder.  Using the live-view gobbles up the battery power so have a charged-up spare handy.  I also invested in an LCD screen protector.|#|

10.0|#||#|Quite a few different camera modes, and the manually adjusted aperture settings scroll button is a little difficult to scroll while you hold down another button to allow it to work. Slightly frustrating, but after about 5 minutes of playing it becomes easy, this could be more down to lack of photography know-how.

I found the manual a bit full on, so I ended up purchasing a further book based on Sony SLR cameras to explain how to use the features for a few areas I wanted to improve to a high standard. Pretty minor point though as it's down to what style user manual you prefer

I am very frustrated I cannot register. I brought the same model before a silver and it got stolen. Now I want to register it and track it if it gets stolen again but I cant. I would be grateful if someone gets back to me to guide me through how to register the product. I have been to a center to try to register my phone but they dont have access to the internet so I have to do it myself which is annoying. Also, is it possible for the manufacturer to immobolise it if it gets stolen like to immobolise a mobile phone?

PC socket for flash lead.  Proper mirror lock up not combined with 2 sec delay.  Improved weather-proofing and stronger body.
9.0|#|Overall, definitely the camera I was expecting and more.|#|On opening the product, the lack of a proper rear lens cap on the supplied lens, as well as the omission of a lens hood raised a eyebrow, as this would have been something that the user would expect to be included by default, not as an added expense to purchase.

10.0|#|Easy to use for those new to using DSLRs, menu function offers hints/explanations about the various camera settings, camera has several useful 'trick' functions, camera has a nice size and weight, in body stabilisation means the camera can take advantage of old compatible Minolta lenses, takes SDHC cards which are inexpensive but fast and have a high capacity, articulating Live View screen allows shots to be taken with the camera in useful positions (held both high up or low down).|#|Some functionality present on an older 'less sophisticated' Alpha model (A200) has been removed (for example, the ability to adjust flash intensity in Night Portrait mode), dedicated button to enable/disable Steady Shot now replaced by having to to make changes via main menu.
10.0|#|- Brilliant image quality due to it's APS-C sensor, which is also the same sensor used in the Nikon D7000 (a camera 50% more expensive).|#|- You don't get much FPS of burst shooting when shooting in the RAW file format.
10.0|#|Good points are the hand held night shots absolutely amazing with ISO 2500 with no noise and the panaramic shooting is simply brilliant and live view is impressive this camera is so fast and responsive. Value for money it is amazing I would highly recommend this camera.|#|Bad points the camera is not that easy to use because it has so many features it makes it complicated in the menu system I wish it had the two dials like my old Alpha 100.

10.0|#|The multipoint systems is very good in tough light conditions.   The body stabilization means a wider range of lenses.  The panoromic mode is very good.  One major improment is the LCD screen-  size, flex modes and clarity.|#|Have not found any yet
9.0|#|Good solid camera with fairly easy controls except the controller button but in general a first class piece of equipment that I would have no hesitation in recommending to other people|#|Controller button I find to be a little awkward to use.

10.0|#|The Alpha 580 punches well above it's weight offering an outstanding range of features.  I purchased it with the manufacturers 18 - 250mm zoom lens which is equally impresive.

Focussing is also rock solid. Colour balance and image quality are first class.|#|As with many cameras with built in flash, the pictures can be a bit too brightly lit but this can be corrected easily enough once uploaded to a PC.
9.0|#|A very easy camera to get great pictures from. The pop up help feature is very good if you are new to DSLR photography, though in my oppinion this is not an entry level camera, like the A300 was, and compared to that excellent camera this one is so much better in every respect.|#|The only annoying feature on my camera is with video playback. The actual recording is brilliant but the camera seems to keep wanting to play it back at every opportunity!

The battery is the same power and size as the A100 but sony decided to put a groove in the back of the A580 battery which fits a bar inside the battery compartment meaning if I need another battery I  have to buy one and can`t use the one from the A100,  Bad Sony.!!

10.0|#|Amazing features for the money, fantastic image quality, jpeg + raw is very useful, ISO is very good quality and high range, built-in stabilizer works well (in good light), HD video recording is high quality, huge plus is the compatibility with Minolta lenses which are fantastic|#|Standard 18-55mm lens is a disaster, even at higher apertures, shooting with the lens in poor light is pointless, external flash hot shoe not compatible with other camera manufacturers and Sony flashes are very expensive - annoying, Sony lens range is also poor and the better Minoltas are hard to find.

9.0|#|Great image quality and colour fidelity. A good size for larger hands. Battery life is good and dual memory card slots an advantage.|#|This is a good SLR camera, but Sony should consider a replacement for the Alpha 700, including a pentaprism viewfinder and more substantial build - I for one would buy.

10.0|#|SUPERB IMAGE QUALITY EVEN AT HIGHER ISO'S COMBINED WITH INNOVATIVE FEATURES LIKE AUTO HDR AND PANORAMIC SWEEP MAKE THIS A WONDERFUL CAMERA. AT IT'S PRICE POINT IT'S UNBEATABLE AND COMPARES TO MORE EXPENSIVE OFFERINGS FROM NIKON AND CANON.|#|LIKE MOST OF THE DSLR'S WITH A TRUE OPTICAL VIEWFINDER LACK OF AUTOFOCUS IN THE VIDEO MODE IS A MINOR IRRITATION BUT I MAINLY BOUGHT THE CAMERA TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS SO I CAN LIVE WITH THIS.
9.0|#||#|Does not come with hot shoe cover,does not come with studio light socket.
9.0|#|I bought the a33  just before Christmas and it hasn't yet had a great deal of use yet, however I have used it enought to be able to comment. The design is more compact than the alpha 350 which I previously owned and yet it sits very well in my quite large hands. The lighter weight is also appreciated and the balance with the standard lens is excellent, although my 18-200 lens does tend to unbalance it a bit., but that's only to be expected. I have found the EV to be very good, far better than any previous ones I have seen or used and the lcd screen is easy to use in bright sunlight. The lcd screen's ability to twist and turn is another plus point. The rapid fire shutter is brilliant with moving subjects, can't see the point in more than seven fps, shutter action is also very quiet, especially useful in quiet indoor locations. Auto focussing is very good especially in video mode and the ability to enlarge a small section of the EV when using manual focus isa boon, especially when using a tripod. The layout of the controls is better than previous alphas. The dynamic range offered with or even without HDR is excellent. Battery life is better than I expected from reading reviews.|#|Zooming smoothly is difficult with a longish lens and this causes video clips to jump during filming. I was caught out and surprised to find that the spare battery from my a350 didn't fit the a33 and I have a number of Compact Flash cards which are of no further use. I guess this is all in the quest for compactness. Nothing else really.
10.0|#|Electronic viewfinder shows you what you get.  Some people like electronic viewfinders, others like optical.  I thought I preferred optical but I soon grew to love the electronic with the ability to have the onscreen data in the eyepiece.|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use and set up quickly. Haven't had a 'good' camera for a while but really enjoyed using this over Xmas. Easy to get good pictures, but I know I haven't scratched the surface with it. The instruction manual got me going quickly and easily.|#|Remember you need a memory card - would be good if they provided a starter one, but that's life!

9.0|#|This is my first SLR camera and it is very easy to get the hand off.  I have been trying to learn how to use as many of the functions as possible and there are a lot of possibilities with this camera.|#|My one BIG gripe, and one which wasn't pointed out to me when I was deciding between a couple of brands, was that the battery life is pathetic and the batteries are quite hard to source at a decent price.  I have to say that this one point disappointed me more than I would like to admit.
9.0|#||#|Appalling battery life. No where near the figures quoted. (charged 4 times to take 100 photos

9.0|#|Excellent camera with great features! Panorama mode, 7 fps, HD quality video are great|#|Accessories could be cheaper
9.0|#|Image quality is good, as I have found with all sony cameras. Menus are very intuative. Nice range of lenses and features.|#|The transparent lens takes a bit of getting used to, and the preview button on the front of the camera is a little hard to reach/use.
9.0|#|Electronic viewfinder took a little while to get used to, but integrated level and 100% field of view more than made up for initial thoughts. Camera set up is relatively intuitive, but of course you can just pint and shoot if that's what you want. Pictures are sharp, and colours natural with the 18 - 55mm kit lens. Hinged screen make taking shots in awkward places/ angles a breeze.|#|Haven't found any yet!
9.0|#|Fantastic video shooting and fast continuous shooting. Kit lens is very good compared to nikon and canon offerings. HD HDMI output for video recording and mic input are good for amateur film makers. Screen is very useful and great definition. A pleasure to use and comfortable to hold.|#|Images a little noisy due to translucent mirror, more manual exposure control in movie recording would be nice.

9.0|#|EASY TO USE AND FAST, STILL IMAGES RECORDED IN JPEG ARE EXCELLENT VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO SHOOTING IN RAW SO GOOD PROCCESSING HERE, IDEAL FOR VIDEO AND UNLIKE OTHER SLR CAMERAS YOU CAN SHOOT VIDEO USING THE VIEWFINDER ALSO HAS A MIC SOCKET, ONLY DRAWBACK WHEN SHOOTING VID IN HIGH QUALITY IS YOU NEED A HIGH SPEC PC ( WHICH I DONT HAVE) TO PLAY THEM BACK WITHOUT JUDDERING ( THEY PLAY OK FROM THE CAMERA )BUT EASY ENOUGH TO CONVERT THEM TO AVI FILES TO EDIT ETC|#|CAN ONLY RECORD VIDEO UP TO 11 MINUTES IN LENGTH BUT IF YOU TURN OFF STABILIZATION YOU CAN RECORD 29 MINS HAS NOT BEEN A PROBLEM FOR ME
9.0|#|Well made, great images with easy to use menus. sony have put a lot of features into this camera. The main feature is the translucent mirror which gives you the 7fps bursts, as the mirror doesn't move between shots. This is more than double some of the other cameras available. Being sony it syncs well with mac and pc. I have not been disappointed with any features on the camera so far.|#|None that I have found yet
8.0|#|7fps continuous shooting.|#|Viewfinder is OK, but not as good as optical.

8.0|#|Most of the features not available on the A350. Panorama works well but firmware could crop stitched image.|#|Would be very helpful if you could pre-select different aspect ratios for landscape and portrait eg 16:9 and 3:2, which change as you rotate the camera.
10.0|#|Very light weight for size|#|None
8.0|#|Great features - a big jump since my last SLR which was a 35mm film camera that I last used about 10 years ago (Minolta 9000) and much better than my last few digital compact cameras.|#|Optical quality of lenses doesn't seem to have improved that much in the last 10 years.

Great features like the 6 shot hand held twilight shot, panorama (but see below)|#|Microphone for video is insensitive.  Panorama shot comes out blue more often than not (does not calculate light input correctly??).  Some faults have appeared : Focus on lens has become sticky.

10.0|#|Great camera. It's a great all-rounder. For beginners, it will hold your hand while you learn; for the experienced, advanced shooter, it has more options that you can shake a stick at. With 2 Live View systems, focus is very easy to nail when shooting in manual mode. Haven't used the video at all except to play with, that's easy too. Very pleased with this camera.|#|None so far.

10.0|#|Shoot ISO 1600 and 4000th sec at f8 with a modest 70-300mm sigma/tamron lens and take shots of a falcon in a stoop, and the results will blow you away, I could not even do that with a Canon 7D, I tried!|#|Other than that, you won't be dragging this camera off me, I have 2 of them.
8.0|#|Easy to pick up and use even if you didn't know your way around a DSLR but with lots of good features if you do.|#|Have had problems with dust on the sensor from the very begining. I had a A100 before and sensor cleaning was easy, for some reason the A580 seems to hold on to the dust!
9.0|#|everything about this camera is brilliant|#|if anything, the price
9.0|#|Better image quality than my A500. HD movies.|#|
9.0|#|Movie mode has proved a useful addition.|#|The non-standard flash shoe makes it difficult to find third party flash guns (Sony ones are extremely expensive)
7.0|#|Good sensor, JPEG results are good, HDR feature is a good feature, good enough for night photography.|#|ISO above 1600 is useless, some features are just gimmicky, video mode could had been better, not enough Sony lenses compared to canon lenses ratio is almost 1:3
8.0|#|Handling, ease of use and features.|#|I've had variable quality with this camera which could be the lens (Sony F2.8 28-75 and Tamron F2.8 70-200 amongst others) or me of course. I've also got an A300 and had the same results so it may well be me.
9.0|#|Having now used a number of Digital Cameras including compact Canon, Panasonic and Casio, and larger format Nikon I found Sony to out-perform all my previous cameras by providing Bright Balanced Easy to View Pictures.|#|Sony discontinued theAlpa DSLR A580 prematurely before its development had been completed and relaced by the over-featured Alpha A55V.
9.0|#|Compared with other similar cameras this camera is tremendous value|#|4. This appears to be the last in a line of the good DLSR cameras - instead of developing the NEX you should have stayed with the a580 and lightened everything.
9.0|#|Good image quality, its a nice to use product overall|#|no af fine tuning, no firmware updates
10.0|#|Auto HDR is also a useful feature, although I can't say I've used it much yet. Build quality, battery life and ergonomics are all very good too.|#|Mine also had a back-focusing problem (it would focus slightly behind the point it claimed was in focus). However I was able to fix that easily after looking on the internet. Basically you take a label off the bottom of the body and turn three allen sockets an equal amount. It's perfect now and only took me about 10 minues to fix, so I've only marked build quality down by 1.

8.0|#|Still finding my way around camera but so far very happy with it.|#|Limited lens choice for APS-C sensor, and Carl Zeiss lenses are too expensive. Batery life not long enough.
9.0|#|Live View - very useful|#|
9.0|#|Very simple to use in both auto or manual settings.|#|does not recognize the files.  This means that i have to shoot in JPEG to allow any work on the images.

9.0|#|The tilting lcd is a wonderful feature.|#|not an optical viewfinder.
6.0|#|compact, rechargeable battery, no of photos stored, photo resolution|#|zoom not enough, speed of recycling for 'next shot', complicated software (not actually needed to download photo files)and poor User Guide (written in Chinese and translated).

7.0|#|Like the panorama and video features.|#|2.  Poor to have to buy a sepaerate memory stick.  Why not include one - every one needs one - and NOT a small 10 image memory card - they are a waste of time and space.
9.0|#|According to value this is perfect product for any one who wants to buy as it's made by Japan. There are many good points such as built in good quality, good quality picture, durability, good looking, easy to operate.|#|No GPRS
9.0|#||#|none
9.0|#|Light, compact and esay to use camera. There are smile detector, blink detector and auto scene selector. It is able to capture indoors (whether it's dark or not) and outdoors beautifully.

9.0|#|Overall it is a very nice product and easy to use with good picture quality and I like the way that the image on the good sized viewing screen is still very easy to see even in sunlight. My first ever digital camera and it's great.|#|It just lets itself down that you have to remove the battery from the camera to recharge and  perhaps disturb the memory card,the charging base for the battery is a bit on the big side for just a simple job, even with my Wifes digital Kodak you can just plug into the side and recharge.The zoom facility could be better.

10.0|#|I am a professional photographer and instead of my heavy SLR camera, I use this. Its great to fit in your pocket and to take with you on holiday.|#|Nothing!:)
9.0|#|You can use it straight out of the box and start to click away , that bit is not an issue.

2.0|#|The only good point with this camera is the Video!  this camera almost replaces a camcorder. The quality of the videos are really good for a compact camera. The HD quality video is good too but its a shame that its battery life is so poor that it can't support other features of the camera like big LCD screen, huge memory etc.,|#|The intelligent features (iAuto, iAuto+, Panorama) are all very poor most of the times as the camera is always wrong in judging the focus, lighting etc., there is no force flash in these modes, only Auto flash and no flash which is very annoying. In the Program Auto mode you have all the options of Allways on flash etc., but you need to fiddle with all the adjustement and you don't get the basic auto features that were avaialble in older sony cameras, so not a good camera for still photography. The battery size is very small compared to the previous (P series) models and hence less capacity for a large LCD screen and large memory capacity camera. No optical view finder, only way to view is through LCD, which consumes lot of battery power. Sony dissapointed us in these basic things. Also the build of the camera is very flimsy, very delicate and not durable at all. The design is so poor that it is very hard to hold as there are only buttons and LCD no place for fingers hence quite often different buttons gets pressed when taking the picture.

9.0|#|The camera is continually taking good pictures even in bad lighting, take this camera everywhere i got and the quality of the pictures are constantly good! The battery always lasts the whole of the night and it is so small and light it can fit in the tightest of jeans pocket without even being noticed - all together a fabulous camera!|#|If only it was water proof.
10.0|#|In short.....I love it!!|#|None that I can think of......although a carry case packaged with the Camera would have been REALLY REALLY REALLY helpful as I like to take the camera with me wherever I go just in case I see any UFO's in the sky and I don't want to take the camera out and about without a safe and secure carry case.

The 3D images look very good on a 3D TV.|#|You have to buy a USB lead to be able to view the photos on a TV - it would have been better if this was included in the price of the camera, as 3D photos have to be viewed on a 3D TV to get the effect.

3.0|#|small and compact|#|I am old and wanted a simple camera, this is FAR to complicated. When I bought it the young man said it was simple and there was a booklet that explained how to use the camera ... there is no booklet , and it is NOT simplle for old folks like me!
8.0|#|I am overall very happy with the camera.  There are many exciting options to make use of and I have tried: soft skin, EASY, the funtion for photographing food, landscape, the timer etc.  It does everything I require and far more and is fun to play around with.  Is is a solid camera which can stand on a surface by itself which is great for when you are using the timer and want to set the timer and then jump in front of it.  The flash is good, it's not too harsh.  It charges quickly and stays charged for a long while.  It takes very sharp pictures in the outside light especially.  The colours are very vibrant.|#|The timer should have a double shot option as you go to all the trouble to set the time and jump into the picture and then it takes only one shot, which may not turn out well.  It needs to take two in close succession to make the time function more useful..

10.0|#|The image quality is astounding, both for still image and video.  We have had so much fun with it, highly recommended.  The built-in help function is also very useful as a reminder for the vast range of functions.|#|The thumbwheel shortcut button is a little awkward to use, it's easier to use the standard menu button instead.

10.0|#|Excellant camera witha slick and slimline design. The exmoor cmos sensor means photo's in dark light are improved dramatically. and features such as background de-focus and intelligent auto give images as close to DSLR quality as you could expect from a compact camera.|#|
9.0|#|small and compact, good on features, large view screen|#|5x zoom is pretty good, but some cameras have 8x/10x (camera wouldn't be as small/compact though)
9.0|#|This camera has a wide range of features, most of which I have tried and I am pleased with the results. The Zeis lens gives sharp results and was one of the reasons I bought it. It's small and very handy to carry around in your pocket.A really good little camera.|#|The on button is a bit small and the zoom button gets a bit of getting used to, but that is the price you pay for selecting a small camera. In sunlight you cannot see the screen, but that is common in all of this type of camera. So really there are no bad points, the camera just takes some time to gain used to. I have only been using mine for the last three weeks!

10.0|#|It's a real joy to use.|#|Battery seems under capacity, but I've probably used the camera more heavily than normal. Some controls fiddly, the zoom is fast and hard to frame shots quickly. Whilst auto modes are sophisticated and impressive, if you are taking pictures in difficult circumstances I think a degree of manual will bring benefits. In which case, there are many manual options available and you will need to get used to using the camera to best advantage.

I have not yet tried to down load to my computer - too complex - my son will have to do that for me. On sunny days it is difficult to see the screen sometimes so a viewfinder might help. The battery ran out one day of heavy use on holiday so I have had to buy a spare - EXPENSIVE

10.0|#|An extremely easy to use camera, which has resulted in many excellent quality photos.  It's also light weight and looks great too.  After a long while researching which camera to buy, I'm so pleased I bought this one as it's a balance of quality and price.

1.0|#||#|when having problems with my camera relating to its ability to hold a charge over the period of two weeks, the second time I sent it off to Sony for the same fault I was charged £30 before I could get it back. The engineers could not in their words replicate the fault in the workshop.Why would I complain if there was nothing wrong? Effectively leaving myself without a camera over the Christmas and New Year period. I must honestly say I am very dissapointed with my purchase and will not be buying any further Sony  products,

There is virtually no internal memory. However, don't let these very minor points put you off if you are considering purchasing as the good points far outweigh the not so good.
9.0|#|Excellent pictures, very fast to respond to the shutter button compared with my old Ixus, and the focus is perfect each time. Superb HD 1080p movies, unbelievably good. Comparable quality to a DSLR but without the bulky body of a DSLR, small enough to pocket. Stabilization is great. Zoom range is great. You will not be disappointed with this, if you can find one in stock, as I think the tsunami has hit Sony production.|#|bravia TV via HDMI there is no hint of this, so in reality this would not be a problem even if you made a poster size print. Also the colours in certain shots can look slightly artificially saturated but this is adjustable in manual mode.
2.0|#|The camera looks good and is packed with features. The screen has a high resolution, although this isn't always noticeable in live-view. It has a good zoom and takes good quality videos.|#|Considering this is an award-winning camera, that it has received lots of favourable reviews, and its price-tag, this camera is a disappointment. The images are far too vibrant. I know that sounds odd but they are too bright and too full of warm colours which don't match the reality of what the eye sees. Moreover a number of the images are blurry with chromatic aberration present. On top of this the flash is far too bright and liable not only tooverexpose shots but also to create flare from dust particles burning out pixels and making large circles on your images. The image quality for this price is just not up to scratch. The screen in live view mode is also a let down. It is very noisy, dark, and looks cheap. Another annoying feature of this camera is the pop-up flash which is located just where you naturally hold the camera with your left hand. It is difficult to take an 'on the spur of the moment' shot with this camera as not only can it take up to three seconds to take the picture after you press the button but then it takes another three or four seconds to process each shot. The lack of RAW and the inability to be able to control the overly-bright flash make this camera a waste of money. Panasonic Lumix TZ7 was a far better image quality at a fraction of the price. I should have stuck with Panasonic but trusted the numerous good reviews. More fool me. There are far cheaper cameras out there which will produce a better image.
10.0|#|I got more than I wanted from this camera. The sweep panoramic option is excellent.  If you know how to operate all the options in this camera then you will get unexpected results.|#|
10.0|#|Excellent picture quality, good zoom, very clever intelligent auto feature which selects the best type of picture in whatever conditions. HD video qualitiy is amazing.Good flash for night pics. A good all round camera.|#|No real bad points
10.0|#|Im a Pro Photographer and take compacts on holiday trips eg South Africa and this is the best on the market. Had a HV5, Good ,but the 9 is an improvement, especially the flash.  Zoom is amazing.|#|When deleting an image it is a bit slow, but this is nitpicking.
8.0|#|Very quick focus.|#|No dedicated macro function - what were they thinking? You have to use the superior auto, which is temperamental - weirdly if you zoom in it decides its macro and zoom out it seems to think it is a landscape scene. It will sometimes focus wide angle on a flower, but otherwise its in the lap of the Gods.
10.0|#|Some additional features which have not yet been used such as anti blink, anti wind|#|Larger phone memory would also be preferred
7.0|#|Great range of features|#|Focus when in telephoto mode
9.0|#|Loads of features. Can zoom when in movie mode ~ not possible with most cameras in this range. Great fun to use. Would recommend this to anyone|#|Comes without a printed user manual. An optional extra for this at £4 would still give Sony a profit and certainly would be taken up by most users. Full manual on PC though, and more than usual info when using in-camera guide.
8.0|#|This is a very high quality camera, that will take images comparable in quality to a DSLR while easily fitting into a pocket. Its excellent macro capabilities and 16 times optical zoom means that is has similar fuctionality as a bag full of lenses. The quality of the video is as good as a dedicated video camera, so in one small package it is a brilliant travel camera. The context sensitive help function displayed on the view finder really does work and is very useful even for experienced camera users. The various scene modes use some very sophisitcated blending, filtering and multi stacking features that would normally have to be recreated in photoshop and the high resoltion  sweep panorame function produces an image that is much taller than the normal ribbon like image.|#|Overall this camera takes superb pictures and video and could so easily have been the very best if only it had less of the gimmicks like 3D shooting and GPS positioning which seem nice, but in practice are probably rarely used  and more of the basics like proper manual control and RAW processing which would have been used a lot  more.
6.0|#|Build and lens are very good. It's a very portable size with a good zoom that doesn't markedly undermine image quality. The video quality, although a little soft, is outstanding. The sound quality is surprisingly impressive also. 10 fps burst mode is tremendous (this dips back to 3 fps for continuous shooting). Takes SD cards. Once you get to know its foibles and weaknesses, you can get some nice shots out of it. Although pretty much auto everything the 1080p 50p/60p video blows you away.|#|What the camera could do with is a firmware upgrade ideally to allow RAW shooting, but at least to allow control over the sharpening and smoothing of jpegs.
9.0|#|light, easy to handle|#|Got to be careful when putting the camera back in the case, can easly switch it on. Best using a hard case, Also the pop-up flash, make sure your fingers are not near the flash when it pops up.

9.0|#|Telephoto lens is outstanding for a compact camera.|#|On/off control button is not easy to use and placed on top off the camera, selection dial not easy to grip and difficult to turn.
9.0|#|I'd used the excellent HX5V for some considerable time until it got damaged. This was a natural choice for me, more powerful zoom, 1080p at 50fps and for the most part I'm very happy with it. It takes excellent photos and videos, it's good in poor light, pretty much all it says in the adds and various descriptions. I can also take photos while recording a video, which is a real plus, saves taking a video grab back home!|#|The shutter release button is now only for taking photos, rather than both photos and videos as in the earlier model. To start and stop videoing you need to use the video record button at the rear, just above thumb position, which takes some getting used to and I'd have preferred it had it remained as with the HX5V model. The zoom, while more powereful at 16x, rather than the 10x with the previous model, isn't as smooth as I'd like, with definite (albeit slight) lateral movement showing when the extreme lower end of the zoom is reached and when initially starting to zoom. This same movement is also apparent at the midway point when the second part of the lens starts to extend and again when it has fully retracted.

9.0|#|Video quality, excellent. The16x Optical Zoom, incredible.  User friendly for beginners yet satisfying for the experienced. Size is perfect for those on the move. Apart from the small flash problem (see below), I can't fault this little camera, it's easy to use, it does everything I need and to a very high standard.|#|Before I bought the HX9, I read complaints about the position of the pop-up flash and that it jumped up in situations that might not need a flash. True, it does pop-up in a stupid place. However, I set the flash to be permanently off as it is only one button push away from being activated. You soon get used to where it pops up. I just wish the motorized mechanism allowed you to push it back down when you are done with it. Instead you need to turn the control dial clockwise to Video or anti clockwise to Panoramic or switch the camera off. You can actually push it down manually but there is a slight resistance. The manual does'nt make it clear if this is safe to do or not. I would ask the manufacturer but I dont have the time or the patience to use their poor customer service.
9.0|#|easy to use, in camera instructions, number of functions|#|awkward to hold without getting in the way of pop up flash
9.0|#|This camera can do everything, from wide angle to massive telephoto, GPS, sweep etc and produces excellent results.. but what most people don't realise is this a true high def video with ultra high quality 50 frames a second video. Lots of cameras claim video but they just look awful, this looks like a high end dedicated video camera.|#|not really bad but all cameras of this sort of size have small sensors and, just like old film cameras, a small sensor can not match a large sensor for quality. By small I don't mean low pixels, I mean small chip size. Unless you are going to produce very large prints this does not matter to most people.

Battery life is so-so.  Manual aperture and shutter speed options are too limited.  Control wheel (on back of camera) is fiddly to use.  Power charger connector is in a stupid place on the bottom of the camera.  No separate battery charger provided (I bought an after-market one for about £10).  The flash is in a silly place - every time I've used it my finger has been in the way.  What on earth is the point of GPS? (I know where I've been).

Having ready several reviews I decided to buy the HX9V and I was not disappointed. The quality of the photographs are execellent so much so that I seem to use the HX9V more than my DSLR. I have also retired my camcorder in favour of the HD capabilities of the HX9V the quality of which, like the still photographs, is excellent. This is a camera that I would highly recommend it is brimming with extras and brilliant at shooting in all conditions.|#|

It is not even available as a PDF. The full version is nearly 300 pages and printing a copy section by section (which in most cases means page by page) takes many hours and it is virtually impossible to do it without making a mistake. The finished printout then has no page numbers to refer to so finding stuff is still difficult. It would be so easy for Sony to produce a PDF version. No consideration of the customer at all.

The image stabilisation means I now have way more usable pictures and should be useful when taking (HD) videos. The burst-shot facility and panoramic-shot feature are also pleasing. Since purchasing this camera I've had so many compliments about the quality of my photographs. Very happy!|#|I would prefer if the charger didn't plug directly into the camera as this prevents its use while on charge. No doubt, I will probably end up purchasing a stand-alone charger as I also bought a spare battery to ensure use of the camera at all times.

Superb picture quality and more than capable auto functions along with ease of handling plus a small degree of manual control, makes it the best compact I have ever owned. I particularly like the in-camera guide for those times when I get flustered because I know what I want to do but can't remember how to set up the camera.  This solves the problem, just look it up and away you go. I have not yet used the movie capability but switching to movie couldn't be easier with just a single button push to switch from stills to movie.  With the available auto facilities, I have not yet taken a badly exposed picture.  It's just so difficult to go wrong.|#|Lack of full aperture priority and RAW capability reduces my score to 9 instead of the full 10, but this is a superb camera nonetheless.

Plain English is what is required and easier use/description of what to do.  I am not a photographer so just picking it up and using it is not as easy for me as someone who is experienced. This should not preclude me from buying or using such a nice camera though as I would like all those fab features as much as anyone else.  The instructions online are very confusing, too minimal and not clear.  Worse than Facebook!  Apart from that, it's a great camera and I need to get a lesson 1:1 in order to learn how to use it.
10.0|#|. In fairness, this camera gets a decent result in conditions that would confound 35mm film completely, and shame many other compacts in the same or even higher classes. The flash is quite powerful, and with experience you can set the EV lower to compensate. Just press the Custom button in most modes to achieve this. Conversely, it copes brilliantly with dimly lit scenes such as parties and so on. In addition to a wide choice of modes, there are manual settings and programmable, quickly recalled presets that will cater for almost every situation. The video mode is awesome and autofocus - as with stills- is mustard, locking on to subject quickly and staying locked unless, say, a tree gets in the way. The panorama modes are fabulous, but watch out for image size in Hi-res. Take time to learn all the options and functions. If you want DSLR results, get a DSLR. If you want an outstanding compact camera with decent battery life, especially with the optional NP-FG1, you might not expect to buy better for the money.|#|Only niggles, really. An external battery charger is a useful accessory - I already have one from my wife's Sony H55. The wheel control is fiddly, but practice with your thumbnail and you'll soon get the hang of it. The lens mechanism sounds a bit clunky on startup and shutdown, but many reviews suggest that this is a quirk of the lens barrel seals re-seating themselves and nothing to be concerned about. I will monitor mine over time.
9.0|#|Camera seems great so far. Just been on holiday and took some great pictures of people and landscapes. It's simple to use and makes it look like we know what we're doing with a camera!

Gps works great, it truly is a feature packed camera|#|The pop up flash is positioned so that when it does pop up it can interact with your finger, but you get used to this and simply reposition where your finger goes.
7.0|#|Panning mode is good but not always perfect on closer examination - should tell you when it is not good enough so you can re-do it|#|

No option to change focus (not that I've seen!)
6.0|#|well built, takes resonable pictures, zoom is good, camera anti-shake works well.  Have used it to replaced my Nikon SLR for 90% of the time, easy to carry in pocket.  Video is good and shows up well on HD TV.|#|No paper manual supplied, 'digital' manual is not easy to use or browse.  Stupid buttom for video record, should use the shutter press button, easy to press record button accidentally.  Easy to accdientaqlly knock other buttons when camera in use.  Pop up flash is annoying.  Use USB lead to charge battery, no battery charger included.  Switching between functions on function wheel takes too long to switch, if you are in one mode and want to quickly move to another to get a quick shot then this is not the camera for you.
9.0|#|Fantastic picture quality. 16xzoom. Panoramic feature. Large display screen.|#|Pop up flash where you would normally hold the camera.
9.0|#|The Swipe Panaramic function is amazing and the quality of the photos is great.|#|No detailed in structions are available in the box or on he net. You have to rely on the in-camera help that doesn't really answer all your questions or solve things that come to mind.
9.0|#|Only just got the camera and took it on holiday last week. Only used the auto settings but excellent picture quality and good colour reproduction. Battery life was really good.

I would easily recommend it to anyone who@s after a good quality alrounder that you can put in your pocket, great for days out and holidays.|#|I didnt find the software that easy to use when burning to disc, and the panaramic feature takes a bit of getting used too, however when you do it's brilliant.

10.0|#|Superb build quality good images straight from camera, SUPERB video, really quick panorama image proccessing. I use a Nikon pro DSLR and I would rate the Sony as a very good carry about pocket compact.

7.0|#|Video is great and ease of use is very good. Auto macro is excellent idea saves pressing button to activate. Zoom is useful and sweep panorama is nice feature. All in all a good camera.|#|My main gripe is no Aperture priority or shutter priority. A camera at this price range should have both as standard. Also the 2 stereo mics should face forward not upwards. Also a few less pixels to allow for less noise would ahve been more beneficial.
9.0|#|Wide/long zoom, gps, HR panorama|#|
7.0|#|Small, good functions, large zoom, quality build|#|On wide angle, faces and bodies etc look distorted.   On Panorama Hi Res the landscape horizons show the joins between the pictures that make up the panorama.   When taking pictures on superior auto the camera takes a long time to process the picture and this makes taking several shots a long process.  Background defocus works OK but can feather the edges on the main subject,
5.0|#|Obviously a very high quality camera that takes excellent photographs and has very good facilities.|#|I will need to do a course (expensive in time and money) to even begin to understand its workings.

5.0|#|Picture quality is very good. Camera is compact. Film sound is pretty good.|#|There's something odd about videos - they look 'wrong', as if you're filming using an unusual frame rate - vaguely unsettling. Also, the PC interface software is not as idiot-proof as previous iterations. Battery life is low by comparison to my older Cybershot, but this seems to be a characteristic of recent Sony gear, as I have the same problem with an MP3 walkman. Pricey, and no external charger included (again, unlike earlier Sony cameras). No manual viewfinder, which is VERY annoying as it turns out, especially on sunny days.

5.0|#|everything, it was very good for a compact camera with excellent picture and zoom quality, full of good features.|#|the problem I had with this camera was the screen colour after taking a photo where not true to life, making any light red / pink colours stand out to be very vivid and therefore not showing a true representation of the photograph. Took it back to the shop and got an exchange but the new camera did the same thing. shame really as I really liked the camera
9.0|#|Features, image quality, build quality|#|Takes a little time to get used to all the settings, particularly when shooting in low light without flash, no question this camera can deliver excellent results in difficult circumstances, just my personal preference isn't the fully automated output in certain circumstances

10.0|#|Was planning to buy an SLR or high end bridge camera but the local shop I have bought several Sony cameras from suggested I had a look at this one instead since I was unsure about carrying a large camera. It felt good to use and the chap in the shop was happy to let me take a few snaps and a video using my memory stick. When I downloaded them I was amazed, the images are pin sharp and even at 16x zoom the image is really good, the image stabiliser is exceptional. The HD video is way better than my old Sony DV camera and that was not on the best setting. Went back and bought one, local shop price was better than interweb price. Having used it for about 5 days now I am even more impressed, I have taken identical photo's with my old Sony W170 and zoomed into small areas using Photoshop and printed them, there is no comparison, much more detail, better colours and I have always been very impressed with the W170. I would say get one, you will not be disappointed.|#|You have to charge the battery in the camera but the battery is identical to many earlier Sony's thus I am able to use the old W170 charger and avoid the problem. The flash is in a daft spot, exactly where your left hand hold the camera. To stop it trying to pop up I have just switched it off, if I need it I will switch it on and move my finger, simples, problem solved.

10.0|#|First Class camera. With the Auto setting My severely sight disabled husband is able to take a photo with it too.|#|None
10.0|#|Video at 1080p 50fps is stunning, even at 720p 25fps mp4 is very good. Autofocus and focus tracking in video works perfectly. The stabilisation mode 2 works very well. Fast burst for stills is excellent. The high res screen is very clear and accurate.|#|The flash is bit intense indoors and I need to sort out the colour balance. Filming at 1080p does cane the battery, but a cheap spare works fine and does the job. As with most compacts, a screen hood or viewfinder is essential in bright conditions. No manual focus (but it's a compact!) but with thought some good use can be made of the aperture and focus options to blur backgrounds etc.

I've tried other memory cards in the camera but it refuses to accept them so I do wonder again why ??? When in dark places you have to change the setting once taking a picture you have to adjust the flash and at times when the flash comes on everyone looks transparent !!!!!

9.0|#|Great zoom and cracking lens.  I replaced a Panasonic which I was very impressed with but this is slightly better and considerably better in poor light and with video.|#|No separate charger supplied with product.  I find separate charging more convenient particularly as I have a spare battery that I can use whilst charging takes place.  However I purchased one complete with leads and spare battery very cheaply!

Also the button to start recording instant HD movie is in a slightly awkward place. Otherwise, it's an awesome camera!
9.0|#|great exposures, clear screen even in sunlight,24mm wideangle zoom|#|a little heavy and bulky. not a camera to carry in a jacket pocket, more for a pouch on your belt.
9.0|#|I have limited dexterity as a result a medical condition, so I required something that was easy to handle. Originally, I wanted a Nikon (either S6xxx or S9xxx) but after being able to handle, and being demonstrated, I first dithered and then purchased the Sony. It is both excellent to handle and produces very good quality images.|#|The burst mode seems limited, but I might overcome that problem!

10.0|#|I am not a camera expert but the Sony HX9 is a substantial improvement on my old point and shoot. The image quality is fantastic in all light settings, the camera is solid (this is why i chose it above the Lumix), the features are easy to use and great to play about with and the video is clean and crisp. I attended the FA. Cup semi final this year and the family behind me were so amazed by its zoom and image quality they stopped me after the match to get the details.|#|None I have experienced.

9.0|#|Great image stabilisation even at 16 x optical zoom.  Good low light ability. Super high quality videos with good sound.|#|The pop-up flash is in the wrong place.  The biggest fault however is that in common with all current compact digital cameras, the lack of a viewfinder.  This renders the camera totally useless in bright sunlight and as such it will always play second fiddle to an SLR,  My 2004 Olympus Miu digital compact camera has a viewfinder and can operate in bright sunshine. Battery life of the HXV9 also appears somewhat limited.

10.0|#|The video is the same great results, i do enjoy using it and found the build quality is solid.|#|Only one gripe is if the flash needs to come on sometimes it is easy to forget when taking a picture and place your finger over the area were the fash pops up.

9.0|#|Very good quality video even in poor light.|#|Pop up flash takes quite a lot of getting used to - there are no easy holding points for the left hand meaning you're likley to twist the camera when shooting with flash since it is balanced on your left thumb.
5.0|#|On 'value for money' I scored high as I got it reduced but if I had paid the full retail price I might have rated it less.|#|I have scored 'ease of use' and 'overall rating' low as it is a complicated camera for me. The manual is very poor and does not tell you how to use it. It does not list all the features or what they do. While you are using the camera things pop up on the screen which might be helpful but disappear again too quickly. I tried to get more information online but found I was just printing out the same manual over and over again. Please tell me how I can get more help with using this camera.

8.0|#|Good value,the excellent reviews I read before purchase were spot on|#|Being relatively new to digital cameras and not being a computer buff ,initially it can be quite daunting knowing the many options available on the camera.It can be trial and error so if possible take the same shots in different modes .The best result will be outstanding

9.0|#|Outstanding video|#|Video control button too small
10.0|#|I have always used low-range digital cameras with bad zoom and bad picture quality, so this is my first camera that is actually 'semi-professional'. So I went ahead and bought it, which was recommended by the shop. After taking some shots outside, I couldn't believe how good this camera was! It's so easy to take amazing pictures and they come out great. And when you see professional pictures where the back is kind of blurred, these are the kind of pictures you will be taking. The zoom is very good, and when your zoomed in fully, the picture quality is almost as good as when your zoomed out. I highly recommend this over other competitors like the Lumix TZ range and Nikon after trying then out aswell. I am so glad I bought this camera and I love it!|#|Not anything major, just that the battery life isn't 'AMAZING', and especially when your using the GPS feature. But even thought you might not get the 300 shots recommended by Sony but you will get very close. I reacently went to the roman baths and got about 200 shots, and after I was just about on one bar of battery. But it's still a great camera!
9.0|#|Really good quality photos, easy to just point and shoot or fiddle about with all the settings if you're that way inclined. Good panaroma mode. Sharp images. Fantastic zoom. Sturdy build. Nice backgroun defocus and soft skin modes. A real winner.|#|Pop up flash. Why oh why??!
10.0|#|very easy to use, am disabled and have a slight shake when taking photos but this camera corrects that and gives me excellent clear sharp and in focus results, also love the panoramic feature as well as the 3D images, if your looking for an all roung easy to use camera, this one fits the bill.|#|flash position takes a little getting used to

The trueness of colour on the iPhone is also better than on this Sony and the iPhone camera is even easier to use (I was not looking for burst photos capacity or panoramic features ... which I have not worked out how to use anyway) IfI had wanted more facility on a camera I would have saved a little longer and opted for a digital SLR (the camera I was replacing was a NikonCoolPics v old model which had a swivel option such that direction / angle of lens and viewing screen could face same direction or opposite directions and all angles in between making for total flexibility even being able to view in the viewing screen a group shot of which one was a part ... whilst still taking the photograph oneself ... although the viewing screen of that camera was minute.  but ... the iPhones can do this anyway ... having 2 cameras which can be swetched to and from at a tap of the screen ........   At least I now KNOW this ...... but it has been an expensive tutorial ........ I am now saving up for an iPhone4S and will sell my Sony camera at the first opportunity.

Full HD video with stereo sound means that I leave the separate video camera at home and just take this.  And with the option for 3D pictures, Sony have future proofed this too.

10.0|#|Excellent pictures, zoom, macro and HDR. A powerful compact which takes superb photos. I don't like using a flash, and you can take great photos without one with this camera.  Takes great photos in all light levels. An excellent compact - prefer it to my DSLR. I traded in my £600 Lumix GF-2 for it and am delighted that I did as the Sony is compact and easy to carry around so I'm more likely to use it. Why spend ages twiddling settings when you can do it easily with this camera?|#|Only problem is I look like a 'snapper' when using it compared to when I'm looking through the viewfinder of the DSLR - but that's just my vanity and not a criticism of the camera! Nothing negative to say. Superb.
9.0|#|Build quality.  Probably the best pocket digital camera available in my opinion.|#|Anoying pop up flash that is located right where you would place your fingers when holding the camera.  Quite expensive but the quality in all areas helps to justify this.

Early days and yet to further experiment but so far does everything I require. Excellent video quality from both indoor concert and outdoor nature scenes.|#|Pictures slightly red, but this could be due to my professional eye as others don't notice it. Could also be SD card I'm using.  Also when you use the flash it pops up on the left where you're holding the camera which can result in the flash not popping up at all but still taking a photo that was set for flash setting
8.0|#|Overall a good well built camera.|#|Only 2 negatives for me. The first is the position of the flash, even though I was aware of this being left handed has presented a problem but I should get used to it over time. The second issue is there could be a few more interesting scene selection options, ie black and white or vintage etc. Neither of these are bad points as such but they are personal negatives.,

The different modes, especially the soft background mode takes really professional and impressive images. Pamormic and 3D images are also really impressive. This is my third Sony camera in the past 7 years and is by far the best. Also love how it intergrates with my Sony Bravia 3DTV.|#|No separate battery charger so battery has to be charged in the camera. I have purchased the separate battery charger and spare info battery. My previous Sony camera came with a charger that charged the battery out of the camera so a little disappointed that I have had to pay extra for this with this camera.

10.0|#|This is a remarkable camera.  I have had many different cameras, from 35mm to DSLR, over a number of years and few have impressed me as much as this.  It's simplicity, great quality photographs, battery life, ease of use...  I could write lots about this camera.  However, if you want a camera that can flatter a lack of photographic knowledge, this is it.  A camera that has a wide range of manual options, this is it.  This camera really is a true all rounder, with a decent zoom and fits nicley in your pocket.  I do not work for Sony, but would highly recommend this camera to anyone.  One of those rare products that actually does what it says on the tin... And more.|#|The only thing it doesnt have is the kitchen sink!
10.0|#|Panorama function amazing.|#|Not very Mac friendly - no Sony software for Mac therefore have to connect via emulator for GPS updates.  Have given up trying to connect MAc to SD card, I eject the SD card from the camera and read directly from the SD slot on the Mac.
8.0|#|Size of the camera.  This small compact camera is ideal for me as I like to take it with me when I go walking but don't want the bulk of an SLR. The zoom  and 16mega pixels was an important feature for me and I am very pleased with these features so far.|#|You cannot zoom when you are taking a panoramic photograph. Unfortunately this doesn't allow you to catch precise details in the distance - a feature I wasn't aware of when I bought the camera.
9.0|#|24mm wide angle. Steady shot on16x zoom hardly ever need a tripod, all in a such a small camera.  Focus tracking. Superb video and ability to take photo of a frame at 3mp. GPS is also handy to access later, not only  the place of photo , but position of the car.|#|
9.0|#|Fantastic pictures and near perfect exposure every time|#|Pop up flash is in the worst possible position. On/off switch too small
9.0|#|Far too many to mention here, absolutely awesome little camera. My previous camera (still in use) is a Sony DSC-T500. Wonderful little camera, but this is a whole new ball-game. I haven't had it long enough to exploit all it's uses, but what I used is way beyond my expectations. Special for my uses are the Intel Sweep. For shots that can take say, a tall church view when you can't step back far enough. Take an Intel shot with the camera on it's side. Crop it, and there you have it. I need this kind of shot regularly. Also Superior Auto and Multi Shots are fantastic. The zoom keeps everything in focus from 100yds to 2mls. My first shot at this with horses in a field at 100yds and the background town where I live were so sharp I couldn't believe it. Taken from the top of a hill is the best picture of this kind I have ever taken. As a keen cyclist and walker, my cameras have to be small and fit into pockets and be instantly available. Particularly on a bike. Perfect.|#|Just beware of holding down the 'Pop-up' flash area......that's about it.
9.0|#|Panoramic pictures easy to take and look great.|#|User guide is not well laid out and can be confusing in places.
8.0|#||#|It's not easy holding with one hand as the pop up flash comes in the way sometimes hand covers flash Hve to remind others not to put fingers on top of flash
10.0|#||#|Nothing negative about the camera it does exactly what it says it does. Would have liked the feature where you can take a picture with one colour highlighted amongst the grey but the other features sure out-weigh that small point
9.0|#|A quality camera, with excellent results.|#|Expensive, compared to other camera's with similar features.
6.0|#|- Very handy|#|the next day flew to London for a tour, i put the camera in my pocket and unfortunately i had a tiny bump towards my pocket which i didn't feel about it. However,when i removed the camera  i saw a huge crack on the screen and the display was completely damaged. Then took the camera to the shop where i bought it and they told me it would take 4 weeks to be fixed. Few days back which is five weeks from the day i submitted the camera, the customer care called and said it would cost 200 USD to get it fixed. Since i had the warranty they said they will fix it. So far i just spent 1 day with the camera, for some reason i kind off regret why i bought the camera although it was just un intention accident.

9.0|#|Easy to use with wide range of features - very intuitive if you have used another Sony camera before.  The Panoramic mode takes a little work but is a great feature.  Small and compact it travels with me when the DSLR is not portable enough.  Offers very good value for money at the price.|#|Screen can be a little difficult to see in strong daylight.  Slim body can be a hard to balance when the zoom is extended fully. Picture quality is impressive but is not a replacement for a DSLR.
9.0|#|Small well built and pocketable. Feels good in the hands and is easy to use. Inteligent auto solves most problems especially if you just want to snap away without going into detail. Love the zoom and the anti wobble which comes in handy for the older snapper who is no longer steady when shooting.|#|A bit pricey but you only get what you pay for. I was disappointed not to get the forty quid off but the offer had just finished when I bought mine but is back on again now which is a sore point. This is my first Sony but not my last.

Quite frustrating. Sony also continue to provide useless software to upload your images to, plus loads of other things on the DVD you just don't need - bloatware city. Just don't bother Sony - focus on the product, and let people that actually know about image software sort that out.

9.0|#|A feature-heavy pocket-sized super compact. Huge 16x optical zoom. A great portable alternative to a full SLR, with many of the same features. Photographs look sharp with lots of detail. Panorama and 10-shot burst are great extras. With my shaky hands the image stabilisation, especially at extreme zoom, is impressive. Adaptation to low natural light is very good. Basic semi-automatic use, changing exposure and white balance, is intuitive. Rear screen quality is very good. A good camera for the fussy, techie, non-professional snap-shooter.|#|Distortion from the wide angle lens is very obvious with buildings not shot head-on, and the parallel lines in built environments. The menu screens are mildly intrusive, and add a small delay in use. Full auto settings at night under streetlights create a yellow haze. Fine detail in the background of saved images looks oddly water-coloured in close-up. The battery supplied is a disappointing low-end model for this top-end compact. No external charger provided means you have to leave the camera lying around plugged in, and you can't snap and charge. Software is available but not readily provided, and I've struggled to import video. Not recognised as a camera by Windows XP photo wizard.

9.0|#|Wide range of useful manual features - once you figure out how to access them all.   Image teriffic.   Zoom range (16x) truly astounding.   24mm equiv wide angle lens simply brilliant.    Really good for taking time exposures at high ISO rating of the night sky - can get impressive results even in towns.   Can take decent hand held night time images with minimum camera shake and no flash using Intelligent Auto Plus function.   Have used it solidly for a couple of weeks now and no faults - but will reserve judgement on reliability until it's proven itself over a longer period.  I've listed some problems in the next section but these are only minor gripes.      Overall it's probably just about the best camera I've ever owned - SLRs included|#|connector (I think) and they aren't available for sale.

10.0|#|Class leading 1080p stereo HD video recording at 50 fps and 24 MBit/s. Superb optical image stabiliser. Very wide angle 24mm equivalent lens and extremely versatile 16x zoom with no visible degradation in image quality. Very quick and dependable autofocus. Images are colourful, sharp and vibrant. Extremely portable and lightweight. Low light performance is very impressive as is the panoramic sweep feature and digital shallow depth of field background defocus effect.|#|No RAW facility, please consider including in a future firmware update!  Lack of aperture priority control and range of apertures to choose from. Flash pop up is motorised and all to easy to hold the camera with your finger on top of it. Battery can only be charged in the camera (unless you purchase an external charger). GPS takes ages to lock on to a signal.
9.0|#|The optical zoom is amazing for a compact camera. The image quality in low level light is very good, better than my normal preference of choice - panasonic lumix. The panorama feature is cool and the HD video is amazing considering compact size and price.|#|There is no dedicated macro setting, you have to play around with the zoom which often doesn't perform satisfactory. The 3D feature is pretty useless at present time since I do have the faciltity to view 3D photos. Maybe in a several years when the price of 3DTVs is dropped??

9.0|#|Really easy to pick up and start using after an initial read of the instructions.  Automatic modes do all the hard work for you but you have the option to select specific settings.  Lots of functions with great action mode, gives clear images of moving objects and burst mode allows capture of multiple images.  I wanted this camera to take close up images of my kids and shots on the move and have been really pleased with it.  Feels a good solid, well made camera.|#|Slight delay saving multiple images in burst mode before you can use again but not a big problem.  Most reviews will probably say it takes a bit of getting used to the flash which can pop up unexpectedly but you soon adjust the hold position to allow for this.
9.0|#|Panoramic function is good, the zoom combined with the sport setting and the burst shots have proved to be very useful|#|
10.0|#|Its easy to use even for a non-professional photographer.|#|Flash is located where you automatically hold the camera while taking picture but with time you get used to it! Also for what you pay for it, it should come with a case and extra battery. Could do with a touch screen too.
9.0|#|Image quality is fantastic and shames my previous Panasonic. Size of zoom is also a greatvfeture complimented with a range of features make this a great point and snap and is great to compliment a DSLR.|#|No real issues. If I wanted to be nit picky, the menu system does have a couple of dead ends which mean you have to come out and go back in to make a change. That said, this is really being fussy and would not stop me from buying this product again.

9.0|#|Good HD image quality-especially in poor light. Ideal for quality location movie making as it is compact and light. The stereo sound recording is also excellent - bright, clear and loud. The ability to use zoom whilst filming is also a plus point|#|My main problem is with the software supplied. The PMB function is very basic. It allows for a limited amount of editing.  Surely it would be possible to supply software within the PMB that allows for basic editing functions such as adding transitions between clips, titles and subtitles - something akin to the basic Windows Movie Maker/DVD maker software?

6.0|#|Easy to use with friendly menus.  I'm still experimenting and having fun.   Zoom with image stabilisation is good.  I was looking for a small camera that would fit in my pocket. Unexpected bonus is it is excellent for video.|#|Image noise at high iso is poor, but probably the same as any other camera in this category.  Add the Sony leather case and it no longer comfortably fits in pocket.

Picture quality excellent in anything but superior auto|#|Slow to respond to top rotary dial changes for scenarios. Pop up flash sometimes catches me out. No touch screen as we have to use rotary dial to step through options. Superior Auto sometimes makes images look fake.

9.0|#|In general, I like this camera.|#|
10.0|#|The focusing is fantastic. The quality is fantastic. It is Sony Standard Software and Build.|#|2 things needed and later on have been put into similar cameras.  A Swivel viewing method and the ability to take an electronic viewfinder.
10.0|#|Was planning to buy an SLR or high end bridge camera but the local shop I have bought several Sony cameras from suggested I had a look at this one instead since I was unsure about carrying a large camera. It felt good to use and the chap in the shop was happy to let me take a few snaps and a video using my memory stick. When I downloaded them I was amazed, the images are pin sharp and even at 16x zoom the image is really good, the image stabiliser is exceptional. The HD video is way better than my old Sony DV camera and that was not on the best setting. Went back and bought one, local shop price was better than interweb price. Having used it for about 5 days now I am even more impressed, I have taken identical photo's with my old Sony W170 and zoomed into small areas using Photoshop and printed them, there is no comparison, much more detail, better colours and I have always been very impressed with the W170. I would say get one, you will not be disappointed.|#|You have to charge the battery in the camera but the battery is identical to many earlier Sony's thus I am able to use the old W170 charger and avoid the problem. The flash is in a daft spot, exactly where your left hand hold the camera. To stop it trying to pop up I have just switched it off, if I need it I will switch it on and move my finger, simples, problem solved.
9.0|#|Useful zoom for those who do not want to carry a lense. Mode selection works well. Panarama shots and movies good.|#|Micro not great. Takes some getting use to holding with left hand and not fowling the flash, or holding and shooting both with right hand which the design seems to imply you should do.
3.0|#||#|not good in poor lighting and over exposes
8.0|#|The fast shutter speed and auto settings on the camera are excellent. The continuous autofocus is also excellent from the translucent sensor. The EVF will not be to everyone's taste but it's about the best and most accurate out there.|#|The explanation of the features on the camera is not detailed enough considering this is aimed at amateurs making that step up from a compact or bridge camera. Although the camera fits my hand fine, I realise that it is a little small and if you have slightly larger hands it is uncomfortable to hold. The last negative is that the battery does not last that long meaning that you will need to purchase a secondary battery or prepare to re-charge it during a full days shooting.
9.0|#|Very easy to learn how to use. Great video capability. Excellent image quality. Very good screen and viewfinder display. Extremely happy with my choice.|#|Poor battery life.
10.0|#||#|Would recommend a protective film or cover for the lcd screen as it gets smudged easily.
9.0|#|Very fast, very easy for my fiancée to just point and shoot. Has lots of manual settings for the more advanced user. Lots of features in this camera, my favourite so far has to be the panoramic sweep mode. Looks very nice|#|Not many to be honest. No covers for the lenses, thought that was abit cheap from Sony and the neck strap is abit lame too. That's really the only faults i can pick right now.
9.0|#|Quick focussing compared to Canon and Nikon equivalents. 7 FPS feature is great. Twilight modes for low light condition shots without using flash is great. The 2 lenses are great and it's a good value package. HD movies come out really well. PMB software is useful and intuitive. Controls easier to manage than rival models. You get a brief description of each mode as you switch to it|#|long lens (55-200mm) does not focus as quickly as the normal lens. Can't think of much else. I'm v happy with this camera
9.0|#|Easy to use. I am a relative beginner who has just had several point and shoots so I was worried that I may find the dslr tricky. Not at all I Haven't even looked at the instructions and have taken several hundred great photos. First battery charge lasted for around 350 shots and lots of messing around with settings.  The viewfinder takes a bit of getting used too but this is not negative, and now just feels right.|#|None

I plan to progress through taking a course to enable me to understand the best settings for different images, although the quality of my current photographs is very good.|#|None found so far .

I love my A35 and I am thrilled with the picture quality.|#|It eats batteries, had to buy an extra one and I think I will probably have to buy more if I take more of my trips that keep me away from mains power for days.
9.0|#|Excellent phocussing and stability in an elderly hand; so many features clearly explained for an amateur.|#|Easy to press unwanted buttons when handling the camera body.
8.0|#|Great package at a great price, not quit everything you need, but an excellent starting point. Camera with lenses produces some excellent quality pictures. Has loads of features to use and experiment with. You can set it to take RAW and JPEG pictures at the same time. You can use it as a point and shoot on Auto or devle into the features to make some very interesting shots. Well worth investing in a spare battery.|#|The zoom motor can be a bit on the noisy side though. With the zoom lens under very poor lighting, there is a very faint drop off in picture qaulity at the frame edges, but not very noticeable.

9.0|#|A good all round camera, superb paparrazi mode|#|the camera can switch on in my bag with all my other things and the battery also is known to open and fall out
9.0|#|Excellent picture quality and in auto mode gets it right most of the time.  quick no really shutter lag and video recording easy to use with a dedicated button.|#|patchy support for RAW.  the inbuilt help is good but still tricky to remember where all the settings are when you want to get a bit more adventourous.although a lot smaller than a slr its still bulky with the larger lens attached
8.0|#|Ease of use despite the slr like function and quality.|#|not as compact as expected but guess that's the price you pay for a good lens and while on it the price is not that chepa considering you can get a decent dSLR for less.

Not possible to clear SD card via USB computer interface. Shutter release button does not protrude sufficiently to make it easy to locate. Pictures not good unless lighting is even all across the scene.
9.0|#|Fits into my pocket|#|As with all digital screens - can't see your framing in bright light
9.0|#|- Ability to take continuous pictures in a row ignoring the displayed picture.|#|- I gave it an 8/10 for value for money cause I think the cost was a bit expensive (even at duty free in an airport), but it's a really good camera, so even though I hesistated about the cost, I figured it was worth it.
8.0|#|Size is fantastic, so easy to pop in to a pocket and not be aware that you are carrying a camera. Very easy to take out a take a photograph. Quick and easy using the auto mode.|#|Too easy to accidentally catch the display screen and jump to another screen. I appreciate that the touch screen can be switched off but doing this does slow things down. I'm not entirely satisfied by the picture quality but the size was the most important choice for me so weighing it up I think it is satisfactory.
10.0|#|Light, convenient to use and I learned a lot of new things such as making videos.  Very glad that I purchased.|#|Some form of protection for the touch screen.Viewing 'eye' to close to the side; this results in taking pictures of your finger!!
9.0|#|Took great care and time to research CSCs to get it right. Excellent carry around camera. Large sensor (APS-C) so very close to prosumer DSLR images output.  Very happy with purchase and images!|#|Menu took some getting used to but once ISO in particular was found and I customised the limited buttons for quicker access all has been well!
9.0|#|Much better quality and usability than the previous generation NEX-5 (which I have owned) despite the apparently modest spec upgrade.|#|Menu system is not always 100% logical and I forget where some of the less frequently used settings are.
8.0|#|Video is excellent and very easy to use.|#|Poor autofocus in macro mode. It will select the corrwect exposure if it is focused a couple of times. Hence centre weighted is very difficult to master. Easily distracted by other objects near prime focus.

9.0|#|Excellent picture quality, light weight and small size.|#|I haven't had the camera very long, so am still struggling with the menu - although to be fair I'm stepping up from a simple point-and -shoot
8.0|#|Potential for great OOC image quality with good lenses. Kit zoom lens is reasonable and good at certain focal length and aperture sweet spots. High ISO image quality is great for the product class, especially if working with RAW files. Focus peaking useful on MF lenses. Short register design makes this body great for using legacy MF lenses. Useful and fun in camera effects and features, e.g. Hand Held Twilight mode. Good bright screen.|#|No option to set limits to ISO/shutter speed/Aperture range in auto ISO, aperture or shutter priority modes. I believe at least the ISO range can be set with the NEX 7 but as this is simply a firmware tweak it seems pure marketing to leave it off of the NEX 5N. No control over audio gain on video. Port and battery covers feel a little flimsy, but about normal for the class of camera. Low button and dial count interface does get in the way occasionally, though not often when custom keys have been configured to your needs. Shutter is quite loud. Battery life not fantastic especially if you need the screen brightness full on, as you may in bright outdoor light.
10.0|#|I am no expert but I think thats the point. I have no camera skills yet with this camera i can take pictures which make it look like I do. Itsa quality and ease of use are excellent. I was worried about the size but its nice and small and pretty light weight. I figured if i wasnted a camera for when i was out in a bar i have an iphone so this is for holidays and times when its not so likely to get showered with drinks. so far i'm loving it.|#|

9.0|#|It's the perfect size to carry with you everywhere. The flash is a neat little accessory. Great alternative to a cumbersome SLR.|#|It would have been nice to have a viewfinder. The accessories are extremely overpriced ( a viewfinder retailing at over £200!)
9.0|#|Battery-life Pretty Good.|#|Expensive
5.0|#|Image quality Is Second to None, really easy to navigate the menu systems. Gives amateur photographers the ability to take professional pictures.|#|There's a manufacturing issue where something rattles in the camera body which is picked up on the internal mic. This can be heard on video play back as a clicking sound. Ive been to various stores and all cameras have the same problem. Hopefully there will be a fix shortly as the camera has  potential to be excellent.
8.0|#|Very easy to used and good functionality. Does everything it says on the tin. No red eye reductions which is puzzling but have not had it occur yet so maybe Sony have found a solution.|#|Not a built in flash which I would have preferred. However have left the removable one in position which has not given any trouble so far.

Easy to use, to start up, simple menu, Small body wich one is really compact and looks nice. 55m lens - thats all what you need for your everyday photos. If you looking for more from this camera, just buy more lenses. Sony NEX-5N suits lot of lenses.|#|You can easily lose the lens cover, because lens cover without strap.
10.0|#|into doing more advanced photos, then this is a perfect camera for you. It's not rocket science and it comes with plenty of features that a beginner can use. If you're an experienced photographer, maybe you'd go about it in a different way, but as a transition into more advanced photography, this is excellent. Good design, good grip, user friendly.|#|Lens is bulky and weights more than the body. But that is also one of the advantages - that the body is so small.
10.0|#|It is a really good camera.|#|Have to fiddle to change\reach some of the settings which is annoying on full manual. Some buttons are customizable but not totally freely.
5.0|#|Good image quality, nice range of features, ease of use|#|Sony NEX-5ND lacks a very important feature - it doesn't allow tracking the camera when someone publishes pictus on the net - for this reason my camera, which was stolen from me in September, is now lost forever. Needless to say - I won't buy anything by Sony again, because all other brands offer not only quality, but also tracking. Sony took the last hope away from me.

9.0|#|Amazing camera - an upgrade from my a700 and before that my KM5D. Video quality is excellent, still quality at 24MP is also excellent. More features than I know what to do with, but I'm using even the ones I thought I wouldn't. Easy transition to the EVF - I'm sold and it would be hard to go back to OVF, which is surprising. After almost two months, I can say I'm thrilled with this!|#|Had one instance of a software bug where I had to reboot the camera by removing the battery (I'm using v1.04) - that's the ONLY reason for the 8 in build quality. The hardware itself seems very well made. But that one software event was only once in more than 1,000 frames.
10.0|#|This is one of the best DSLR's I have ever own.  The quality of the images are outstanding.  HIgh ISO capacity is good right up to 6400.  It is well built and easy to use.  I use it with Sony's 16-35mm and 24-70mm F2.8 CZ lenses and the lenses get the most out of the 24 megapixels fore sure.  I'm looking forward to the A99 coming along.  Thank you Sony.|#|Battery life is shorter than my a580 or a850 so make sure you get an extra battery or two.
9.0|#|Very detailed images,  colours, ability to fine tune lens focus,  EVF information especially the horizontal level.  Fast focus, toys (panoramic shots, low light multi shot images).  Solid feel and easy to hold.  Digital zoom, focus magnifier.  Articulated LCD screen. Camera initially did not feel as well made as the Alpha 700 but the more I use it the more I like it.|#|Movie button in an awkward place.  Camera slow turning off.   Battery certainly goes flat a lot sooner than with the Alpha 700 especially if you forget to turn it off. ( Alpha 700 could be left on for several hours and still be OK)  Initially sent with firmware version 1.02 and this was a disaster as the camera kept locking up especially after using the video.  Shouldn't have been released with these sort of errors.  I now have version 1.03 and everything works.  High ISO shots only good to around ISO 1600  ( around a stop less than the competition)  though as I mainly take landscapes this is not of great interest to me.

10.0|#|Great controls during movie recording|#|
10.0|#|Build quality is superb, though I wonder how long the joystick will survive. All of the most used functions are ideally placed close to hand - not buried in menus and sub-menus like some brands. The digital viewfinder is great, it is customisable to display the shot just taken for 2 or more seconds and the display has a choice of up to 4 modes including a level and tilt meter which is ideal for landscape shots.|#|It has locked up on a couple of occasions, once when doing heavy processing of a night scene. Had a problem when shooting in a studio - the digital viewfinder goes dark as you close the aperture down to allow for the studio flash, leaving it too dark to see the model. Haven't worked out what the answer is yet. Waiting for a call from a Sony tech about that one.

10.0|#|Now this is moving on big time and the new SLT feature is really good.|#|Battery life poor. When using RAW I find the processing speed is too slow and the camera can freeze whilst waiting for it to clear.  Irritating.
9.0|#|EVF is brilliant, and once you are used to it, I wouldn't go back. Image quality is first class. 12fps shooting is so easy with dedicated setting. Well built and has a quality feel. My third Alpha and a truly brilliant camera.|#|Camera can be too clever - you can do this in this mode, etc. Takes a little working out, but you'll get there,
10.0|#|There are far to many good points to go into and i am still finding my way around this great camera,i will give it another review in a couple of months.|#|When you have to make adjustments to take into account of your bad eyesight you keep hitting the video record button and start filming.
8.0|#|All my old Minolta lenses are compatible with this body.|#|Seems as though the machine needs to be updated on line quite frequently. Now that is important - yet I honestly don't remember any instructions highlighting this need in the manual. If it's there - I apologise. But it should be in red, or capitals, or on the front page, or somewhere really obvious, please.

9.0|#|Oled screen in viewfinder is superb. Built extremely well. Image quality also superb.|#|None at present.
10.0|#|Just got this camera from Jessops and starting to fully explore all it can do. If you like to take lots of shots of people or animals in quick succession to capture fleeting expressions or behaviour then this camera is hard to beat. The image quality is outstanding and this camera is a match for any Canon or Nikon at considerably higher price points.|#|Due to the build quality, the camera is slightly heavier than the a55 especially if you bought the camera plus lens bundle - the lens quality is outstanding. But as it fits really comfortably in the hand it isn't really a problem.

RAW files are particularly awesome and are comparable to the 'compressed RAW' files produced by my full frame A900, although not quite up there with the 'full RAW' files from the same camera (but close). I was already familiar with the SONY menu system so that presented no problems at all and I was up and running out of the box. A high quality well built piece of equipment.|#|The EVF is not very good in low light and images can be noisy! After updating to the latest firmware release (version 1.07) the noise problem has been considerably reduced and is now comparable with all other cameras in its class. A further way of eliminating noise in this camera is to shoot in RAW mode and expose to achieve slightly 'bright' images, particularly in poor light. You can then apply the necessary corrections in imaging software on your computer later.

8.0|#|The speed of the camera is very impressive and it is packed with features.I haven't had the camera very long and have taken some nice shots .The smart teleconverter is a great idea ,unfortunately cannot be used in Raw format .I own an A700 and many of the features on the camera are better ,but not all.|#|As has been mentioned on many occasions ,the noise levels on images are irritating to say the least .I have experienced unacceptable noise even at ISO 400 in bright sunny conditions .I have used the camera mainly with 70-400G lens and  have had varying results .Longer shots of birds showed little detail but closer subjects came out beautifully .Shots of flying subjects were grainy and the blue sky very noisy .I will persevere with the A77 because some shots are impressive and I imagine with other lenses results will improve .The video seems very good ,although I haven't really given it a fair trail yet.I wouldn't want to put anyone off buying this camera ,because overall I think it will be a good tool ,if like me they are fairly loyal to the brand .
10.0|#|Lots of features for your money, easy to use.  Once you get used to the non optical view finder you realise it's benefits over a traditional view finder. Basically you see what it hitting the sensor in real time rather than having to change the settings after the shoot has been taken. Processed shots taken in RAW show amazing detail with a pleasing colour palette|#|Battery life fractionally reduced compared to a550 for example. Expect to get approx 50 less shots per battery charge. However only minor point as always carry plenty of spares when on a shoot. Have also purchased battery grip which is also excellent.
9.0|#|Very versatile and full featured camera. Fast and reliable autofocus. High speed shooting modes and continuous autofocus. Solid build quality. Clear OLED electronic viewfinder makes working in low light or with off camera flash much easier. A lot of camera for the money.|#|Extensive menu system takes time to learn where particular settings are located, although most commonly changed settings have dedicated  controls. Slightly more image noise at high ISO settings than some competitors.
9.0|#|Good feel, solid build quality, great features, extended battery grip, amazing image quality, super fast shutter speed which is fantastic for fast moving subjects, weather proof.|#|Different battery to other Sony SLT cameras (A55 for example) so any additional batteries you have purchased for other Sony SLT will not fit.
10.0|#|Excellent pictures, easy to use after a Minolta, compatibility with historic lenses and flash gun.  Sensible access to menu functions and options without having to go through menu each time.|#|Printed Handbook far far too limited - had to buy an independent guide to begin to be able to use the camera to its full capacity, and to have to do that at this price for the camera is an insult.
10.0|#|Very well made, lots of features, easy to use|#|None
8.0|#|Loads of features.|#|If Auto Review is selected it appears in the viewfinder as well as on the screen, therefore causing a delay in composing the next shot. This problem obviously does not exist with an optical viewfinder. I would much prefer to be able to select Auto Review on the screen only.
9.0|#|The high resolution. The speed of focusing and instant shutter response. Quietness thanks to the lack of moving mirror (this is a major plus that is rarely mentioned in reviews). Strong build quality with moisture sealing. SSS means all my lenses have anti-shake. Sweep panorama feature. Video capabilities. Some aspects of the viewfinder such as focus peaking. AF micro adjust.|#|No manual gain control of audio.
9.0|#|The camera produces very high detailed images probably the best that I have ever seen and that includes my canon 5D Mk2. In video recording terms it's best in the business being a video man I have tried all the settings and formats and I could hardly fault it. The images do not suffer from arti facts and flickery images when you pan or tilt the camera it just behaves like a high end camcorder and it produces images like high end camcorders are ten times higher in price.|#|It's not the perfect camera but not cameras are. The ISO level above 1600 could have or shoul have been better Sony will hopefully put 100% lights in the SLT Technology and bring out a full frame version and believe you me I will be one of the first ones to buy one.

9.0|#|I bought it mainly for the 12 frames/sec and to add to my Sony and Minolta kit. Detail in the viewfinder is great as are the levelling markings. The sweep panorama will be a good feature for large groups rather than stitching multiple images together. I'm looking forward to using it for sports photography, especially cricket shots. The moveable screen will be very useful as will the HD video. A great additon to my A700.|#|Really disappointed that the battery grip for my A700 doesn't fit the A77. As the A700 upgrade this almost seems like a deliberate way to make people buy more accessories which I won't be doing. The EVF is great but still not as good as an optical viewfinder but it is an adequate trade off for the extra frame speed and viewfinder information. I had the camera locking up problem the second time I used it. Had I not had my A700 the shoot would had been a disaster. The firmware upgrade seems to have corrected that.

6.0|#|Some of the features are a bit gimmicky but nice to have.|#|Noise is excessive given the price of the camera. No better than my A200 which is very disappointing. Noise in the viewfinder is excessive in low light conditions. This is why an optical viewfinder is sometimes better. Not sure that I would have bought the A77 if I had known these limitations.

9.0|#|Image quality and features|#|None at present
8.0|#|As it is a Sony I know it will be good! To be honest I bought it ready for my retirement in February 2012 so haven't really had a chance to use it yet!|#|Not come across any yet!
4.0|#|This camera is packed with features and gives you immense flexibility to take good photos if you can master its features.|#|The base of the camera is defective with the plate (with N50 inscribed on it) which is fixed with 3 screws moves at the left and right edges. This manufacturing defect is so discreet that you will not notice it for a while. I am extremely disappointed with its build quality after having spent a good sum of money.
9.0|#|The electronic v'finder can never match an optical one, especially when the light levels drop, but it does give you an easy 10fps by not having that mirror flapping about.  The electronic spirit level is superb - for tilt in all directions.  The inbuilt image stabilisation is clever - whereby all lenses are stabilised by the 55's vibrating chip.  It's a wonderfully compact camera considering it has the APSc chip and not the Micro 4/3rds. It has the Sony name.|#|A petal lens hood should be included at the price - especially as it's the lightest, cheapest, simplest accessory that will immediately improve image quality.  Forget the lens cap, but not the hood.
10.0|#|Easy to use, Flawless Pictures, All functions Work Well. Awesome camera and would strongly recommend.|#|While taking studio portraits the view finder and lcd go dark, I was using a shutter speed of 200 f11 on a iso 100 i had to either press the flash button for the lcd to work or adjust the shutter shutter before i could take a photo otherwise im shooting blind.

9.0|#|Very easy to use and get really pro shots without alot thinking.|#|Please watch for sticking zoom on the kit lens.
9.0|#|Up graded from a200 so was familiar with use. Clear instruction booklet, on screne info on each setting, 10 fps, panoramic shooting, very quick focus. Infact all features are great. Movie easy to use, quality very good. Over all I love this camera and pleased I spent the money.|#|range. Lens rather sticky, I have changed it (this is why I have given 7/10). Battery will run out quickly if left on LCD monitor.
10.0|#|Lots of facilities to choose from. Exposure monitoring points really work well to get best out of shots in difficult situations. Sometimes wonder why its changed parameters or mode - its just that its making better judgement than I am. Very satisfied with results so far. Need tripod for mutishot panorama mode for hazy, smoothly varying landscapes, but stitch and exposure tracking very good.|#|Initially had sticky zoom lens which was replaced no problem by Jessops. Lens working fine now so zooming and panning in HD video mode nice and smooth.
10.0|#|superb image quality in auto mode , just point and shoot , its that easy, have yet to get into depth with the abilities of this camera as im an amature just stepping up to a dslr but so far the results are outstanding.|#|none so far
8.0|#|perfect EVF and good features. Upgradable.|#|Not waterproof, tilting and twisting screen is a marketing gimmick. Should have been supplied with a UV Filter and a half decent camera case. The supplied 18-55mm lens is not good enough.
8.0|#|Superb design features to help make sure you get great pictures. I can use all my existing Sony / Minolta lenses and it all seems a solid build. The LCD viewfinder is just the job and 10 frames a second opens up a whole new field of imagery.|#|The camera is a little small in terms of 'fit' in the hand - but of course this means it is more compact for travelling than most SLR's and is also lighter..
9.0|#|preview of the exposure, so there's no need to take a shot and check the result on the LCD as you have to do with a conventional DSLR (but note this causes issues with manual exposure using studio lighting). Some may not like this first generation EVF and prefer a more traditional OVF, but for me the advantages more than outweigh any slight problems. The rear screen is excellent and articulates, but can't be used for self portraits on a tripod.|#|The rubber eye cup is very easily lost, and I've already had to replace mine. There are a few quirks in the current firmware that could easily be fixed. For example I normally shoot RAW+JPEG, but to select HDR or multi-shot NR modes you have to change to JPEG only first, however you can choose hand-held twilight or panorama mode and it automatically switches to JPEG only... I don't use mine for studio work, but others have complained that it doesn't work well with studio lights. The built in flash is a bit underpowered, and there's no separate AF illuminator. Battery life is a bit poor as it's small and the constant live-view means it uses more power than a conventional DSLR: always carry a spare.
9.0|#|The easy of use on helpfull tips the camera gives you when you change/select any mode function. One thing that does astound me is that nobody in the shop any photographic shop or any thing I read about the camera actially said it had a build in GPS system. Been able to see where i took a photo is great and a real bonus.|#|55
9.0|#||#|Very poor battery life, again a result of trying to miniaturize. It doesn't need to be tiny just because it can be made tiny.
7.0|#|It has many useful preset and manual modes which can create some stunning results. The picture quality is good for this class of camera.|#|Video can only be done in short 2-3 minutes bursts or camera overheats and shuts down.
10.0|#|Amazing photo quality|#|Battery life is a tad short with gps tagging turned on (a tiny gripe, struggle to find bad points
9.0|#||#|Lack of a Battery Grip (Sony don't currently produce one for the A55)..
8.0|#|- Easy to use (useful help screens for menus)|#|- Poor battery life compared to competitors (battery also seems to drain quickly if battery is left in camera when not being used)
10.0|#|Compact due to not having to move the mirror and also very light, Very well balanced not like Nikons I have used in the past. Auto focus is very fast and the auto tracking focus in video and on 10fps mode is brilliant. The 18-55mm lens supplied is a very good lens and very crisp and sharp. The Live view finder is great as you can change camera setting and instantly see the results on screen very handy when shooting wildlife or scenery. Upgraded to this from a Sony NEX-3 and now use both.|#|Nothing else
9.0|#|Looks and feels good to use.|#|LCD screen prone to smearing, sometimes making it difficult to see in bright conditions. Not much of a problem, as the EVF can be used as a direct substitute.
10.0|#|Large screen with eye recognition auto switch to viewfinder - good for use in bright sun. Menus have useful notes which guide you through operation. Built in HD video gives good high quality results. Fast action for quick reflex shots.|#|So far only minus is battery life
7.0|#||#|Grip - just that wee bit cramped
8.0|#||#|Would have liked to see better control of 10fps and panorama modes ;-(.
8.0|#|The camera has many, many options although the full auto mode does a good job too. It produces excellent image quality even at higher ISO. The fast auto-focus in video mode is something the competition only can dream of. The electronic viewfinder is something someone needs to get used to but having a gauge level and histograms in the viewfinder is something I would not do without.|#|In the drive to downsize the camera, the buttons are jam-packed on the back, the control dial is not easily accessible. The grip could have been a bit bigger (personal taste) although it is better than most entry-level cameras.
9.0|#|Built in HDR, video facility, well;built, good layout|#|Could be a wider range for bracketing exposures
7.0|#|Innovative and easy to use. When working!|#|Unreliable, mine failed catastrophically (giving 'CAMERA ERROR' every time shutter button was pressed and recorded out of focus image. Tried all the recommended fixes, but no joy) after 3 weeks, right in the middle of holiday that the camera was bought for. So no pictures of holiday during 2nd week.
7.0|#|Small, light, easy to use|#|- some of the features are too gimmicky and not useful e.h. panarama, the HDR capability is poor and only works on JPEG
9.0|#|Good range of features and very easy to use.|#|Battery runs down too quickly and needs frequent charging.
10.0|#|V good, easy to operate, still learning all about it but so far very impressed|#|
10.0|#|I looked at many Cameras and found this one an all round Camera that fitted exactly. I have not used all the features yet but I am looking forward to working my way around them. A very good featured Camera.|#|None as yet
9.0|#|Does not weigh too much and pretty easy to use. Easy to change settings and use special settings to get different results. Overall I am very pleased with it.|#|The moveable screen is good but the joint feels a bit delicate, I am concerned that it could break off if not handled carefully and if used a lot does drain the battery quite quickly.
9.0|#|very easy to use all the features for a non pro|#|needs sometime to get used to
10.0|#|fast fps. Compact design. All A mount lenses will work. Live view.|#|EVF is difficult to use for night photos.
10.0|#|there are so many great settings and effects, which are really useful. My favourite is hand held twilight mode, where you can take a photo pretty much in the dark and it comes out low noise and in perfect clarity. Madness! And 10fps is brill.|#|None yet. Everyone moans about battery life and.build quality but I've found both to be fine
9.0|#|Really easy to operate the camera. The size and the design (still couldve been more stylish for such a camera) give you a comfortable feeling while holding it with one hand. Its also really fast, and Ive hardly ever missed a moment while traveling. The focusing is also fast. I think its a good price for good picture quality and 10f/s. Overall in my opinion its a really good camera.|#|Its not that light and the image stabilization couldve operated a bit better. And the panoramic option can hardly be used. Even when youre taking a panoramic picture of mountains and a lake below you dont get a clear image of the water because its moving, and always when youre taking a panoramic picture of something thats not moving but still theres something moving in front of it, this something spoils everything (divides the image into separate parts which dont really match each other throughout the whole image). Also when youre zooming, the lens tends to stick at the end so its a problem when youre recording a video. Couldve made the zooming smoother like on Nikons cameras.
8.0|#|Feels solid and good quality in your hands. More facilities than you will ever need (I could also list that as a bad point but all other DSLRs suffer from the same plethora of 'useless'  facilities). Very easy to get high quality images. Superb HD video with continuous focus. Built in anti-shake enables a wider range of lenses. The Sony/Zeiss 16-80 lens is a stunning performer and the best range I have seen - for me.|#|I keep accidentally hitting the video button with my thumb resulting in unwanted recordings; I would prefer video to be selected via the dial. The bottom hinged rotating screen is a silly idea and of very limited use when on a tripod; it needs to be hinged on the side like the competitors'. Long exposure (night shots) picture noise is worse than I would like even at the lowest ISO setting. Air can be heard hissing in and out during zooming - dust ingress!?! Menu layout can be a little confusing BUT I believe there is a firmware update which improves this. A great camera despite these quibbles.
9.0|#|This camara is very easy to use is light in weight  and has numerous features ie panaramic which is very good. The speed of the camare 10 FPS is excelent. I wopuld recomend this camara to anyone. the pictures are crystal clear and can shoot in almost any conditions.|#|When switching from one mode to another the menu that pops up can be annoying it would be handy if this could be switched off.
10.0|#|Fast frame rate, 10 fames per second! Feature set punches well above it 's price point when compared to many other cameras in its class. The camera is pretty small and light when compared to traditional SLR's which can be an advantage when carrying around all day.|#|I find that the Elctronic View Finder can strain the eyes when used for extended periods in low light, there should be a way to change the brightness of the EVF backlight in these circumstances in my opinion.
8.0|#|A well balanced, compact SLR. Quiet shutter. Autofocus works well.|#|Very expensive accessories
9.0|#|Nice to handle... everything I could want|#|sound on telephoto lens spoils video footage .. real shame
9.0|#|After taking some time to review desired features can customise the setup to suit my own preferences from there its the most fun I've had with an SLR (even though it's a SLT) or any other camera.|#|Does take a little while to locate all the features but that's because the camera is so versatile. Very power-hungry when GPS enabled.
10.0|#|smaller than i expected, relatively intuitive to use, outstanding picture quality and creative ability|#|need more time to get the most from the camera, need several lens options
10.0|#|It is an excellent camera. I spent considerable amount of time researching the products for reasonable price and eventually decided on this one. Good value for money (I bought a standard lense kit), light weight, many good features. Video and picture quality is excellent! Battery lasts quite long if you don't use flash or continues shoot but even then it's not too bad.  In some reviews I read it is a great entry level camera but Im sure even a pro would appreciate it. It may be a bit too small for someone with big hands but for people like me who are on the smaller side it simply fits like a glove! It has many shooting modes although I shoot mostly on manual. You can easly use higher ISO (like 800) and there's not too much noise. And one of my fav (and what I was looking for in a camera when I was buying one) is a multiangle screen. It really makes life easier. I could go on and on about the good sides. I am really pleased with this product and I do recommend it to anyone.|#|The LCD screen tilts downwards which can be a bit problematic when you use a tripod and want to shoot a pic of yourself as you simply can't see the screen. It's obscured but the tripod head. Would be better if it tilted to the side. But nevertheless it is not such a big problem.
10.0|#|I find it quick to focus with all my lenses and very fast shutter speeds. pano sweep is excellent works well (jpeg only) HDR too works well quick results on the spot. Menu is very easy to use and descriptive.|#|Not got any just minor bugbares, battery dosnt last long with GPS on all time but you dont realy need it all time anyway.with it turned off will use 20% in 3hrs continuous use
10.0|#|Amazing photos, easy to use camera. Sony. What more can i say?|#|None.
7.0|#|live view very usable|#|lens support not as good as Nikon/Canon
10.0|#|I would recommend purchasing it to anyone.|#|I honestly cannot think of any.  It is the camera I have been waiting for.
10.0|#|The a 55 is so easy to use with on the go information  for each function on the LCD screen.  I have had a lot of use out of the camera since I purchased it I've hardly put it down it just makes you want to try different things and push the boundaries of photography.|#|I haven't found any and don't expect to find one.
10.0|#|Compact|#|
9.0|#|film capability with small depth of focus possible|#|review of photos or films needs drop into menu structure (why not default is the last item taken - film or photo - or have I missed something
9.0|#|Fantastic Movie quality, and a very wide range of useful settings|#|The only bad point i can think of is the grip and body feels a little cheap for the price of the camera, a more solid body would have made this an excelent camera, though it still is a good camera for almost any purpose
10.0|#|I believe that you would have to spend a lot more money to beat this camera.|#|The only slight niggle is the poor audio quality on video, but that is what the external microphone socket is for I guess.

8.0|#|10 FPS is amazing, the panorama images are excellent also the video is awesome the viewfinder is also quality|#|Was using my camera just now for christmas and was recording video for 4 minutes and it had to shut down due to it overheating other than that its a fantastic camera
10.0|#|simple easy to use, fast response fast start up time, amazing features, all at your finger tips.|#|eye piece cover comes off too easy lost it 3 times and thats with checking always
9.0|#|low light operation ,10 f/s,panorama,fast focus and hd movie all very good.|#|
7.0|#|Good price, compatible lens mount with my A900, articulated rear screen, video capable|#|Control buttons small and awkwardly placed, rear screen articulated at the bottom rather than side, so very difficult to use on a tripod, which is when I would find it most useful. No flash sync socket. Viewfinder brightness varies with exposure - almost impossible to use in some studio situations with manual exposure and relying on flash, as screen is black - worse than any other camera I have ever owned in 60 years
9.0|#|All in all, I would strongly recommend it to anyone stepping up from a point and shoot or just learning DP.|#|I first experienced a poor battery life in the first few days, but disabling GPS and reducing the flash and the use of the LCD screen can buy you more than a full day of shooting (i.e. a few hundreds shots)
8.0|#|Excellent image quality.  Above average user interface (although still a long way from excellent).  Articulated screen with Liveview is also very useful.  Relatively quiet shutter.  Accurate and reasonably fast autofcous.  Accurate autoexposure.  Good auto white balance.  Relatively light weight.  Electronic level indication is useful, as is GPS tagging.|#|Electronic viewfinder poor - highlights burn out too easily, image is oversharpened, no shadow detail. Liveview image on the back screen is much better, though.  Build quality feels a bit flimsy.  Some functions (e.g. Steadyshot) buried too deep in the menus.

8.0|#|Compact size. Good picture quality. Swivel LCD. Fast autofocus even on movie mode. In short, better than my previous camera (Nikon D5000).|#|Too many restrictions! Compatibility issue with sigma lenses. Annoying hum sound while taking long exposure. Loud click sound when open the flash. Cannot take picture while taking movie (my 4 years old camera can do that). AWB indoor is too redish. Easily got overheated. No time-lapse feature.

8.0|#|Very good quality pictures, not too heavy.  Allows me to use lenses from an elderly Minolta 7000.|#|Difficult to find a way of setting up synchronous flash/shoot. The programmes available have preflash analysis and often the moment has passed (especially when taking pictures of children and animals), before the flash is ready to synchronise with the moment of shooting.  Battery life is quite short. On/off switch is counter-intuitive.  It is a complicated camera and every time I use it I am learning to make more and more use of its capabilities, may take me a year or so to be fully competent!
8.0|#|Overall very impressed with the camera - it was a major step up from my previous camera|#|I had problems with the camera - batteries kept sticking in the battery chamber and it would not recognise them, also it kept locking up. I have since returned it and had it replaced

8.0|#|Superb quality pictures, many features (some of which I am unlikely to use), very versatile and good for action shots.|#|Not sure about the layout of the controls, and in particular the 'ok' button and others around it are easy to hit accidentally until you get used to it.
9.0|#|Light, quiet operation, excellent features such as in camera HDR, gps, digital spirit level and sweep panorama.  Has nearly all the features of my A700 and plenty of additional ones. High speed continuous shooting has great potential (although I'm not an action photographer) and is put to good use in HDR and sweep panorama. Excellen image stabilisation, ideal for low light photography. Has all the manual over-rides you could want. Nicely balanced in hand even with heavy Zeiss lens.|#|Sweep panorama needs quite a lot of practice to master as does not use full frame.  Achievable range of sweep seems inconsistent, so may need to take half a dozen panoramas to get the shot you want. Not particularly effective unless using wide angle focal length.  But very good results when you do manage to get it right.
9.0|#|Sensible arrangement of controls, good viewfinder information and excellent adjustable screen.  Very useful features, HDR effect works well in the right situation.  Clear, sharp and realistic colour pictures.|#|None identifed so far.

9.0|#|A new concept that really works well with excellent photo quality and similar videos. Geotags are also useful in landscape work and holiday photos.|#|Some menu items are well hidden
8.0|#|Small and ideal to use with one hand if necessary, GPS data saved with each picture helps identify the location and the camera is nice and compact that even disabled people can use it from their (My) wheelchair. Quality of images is good even filming the International Space Station and NASA Shuttle passing over the UK. Fast frame filming helps capture even sports and high speed action at 10 frames a second and the night 6 frames to make a single picture helps get the best image|#|Self auto forcusing will not allow the camera and lenses to take night time images of Stars or orbiting satellites, even difficult to even take a picture of the moon was impossible because it could not self forcus enough to allow the camera to take a snap shot of full or part moon, it was also impossible to take a picture of the NanoSail-D Solar Sail satellite which was very disappointing and the main reason I bought the camera for taking low light images. Camera and each lens should have come with a demonstration disc so the new user can get the very best out of this camera in particular situations.

9.0|#||#|I cant say that I've really found any bad points yet.  I would have liked a metal body - but for the price you get a fantastic camera
10.0|#|This camera has changed the way I take photographs, I am no longer looking through the view finder, but with the tilting live view LCD screen  holding the camera differently, being more creative, taking photo's from different angles. The size is great, with a 50mm prime lens it fits in my pocket and I can take it anywhere. Panoramic sweep is fantastic - wide angle photographs without a wide angle lens. The HD video is faultless. Fast, Sharp camera good value, when the price drops this is a bargin. Invest in a 50mm prime lens and you wont be dissapointed.|#|No battery grip accessory?
10.0|#|On auto, its so simple to use. Excellent quality images, and the HD video is just unreal. I bought this for my wife, who is quite new to this type of camera. We took it to Lapland and was able to capture the most beautiful images. with the night mode, we were able to capture the Northern lights, showing the amazing green gas. this has made our trip into a magical memory which our six year old can treasure.|#|The only thing which is complex is the reviewing of either movie or stills, having to go into the memory and change. apart from that, its an amazing piece of technology.

9.0|#|light, compact, fast fosucing,improved built in flash over alpha a100, better range of programs|#|jury is still out
9.0|#|when not using it .The explanation for many of the  features directly on the screen  I find very handy. Electronic view finder where you can view the image you have just taken, which is brilliant in strong light where the LCD screen, as on most camears, is less good. The magnifying function works in the viewfinder as well which is very useful when checking details. The inbuilt GPS is antoher clever feature which I have not really used yet. The more I learn about this camera, the more I like it.|#|Not many bad points for me who is not a professional photographer. I find the meny a bit confusing, but I guess it is a matter of getting used to here to find things. The LCD screen gets very messy when touching it.  The sound from the shutter button is a bit noisy. (I wish someone would make a noiseless camera.)
9.0|#|all of them|#|wasted features with the movie mode?
9.0|#|Have not made much use of the video function, but it is easy to take videos and straightforward to play back on my Bravia TV with the HDMI connection.|#|Proprietry hotshoe, expensive peripherals.  LCD could have been larger, it seems small compared with camera body size.  More user-defined control settings or ability to re-programme some buttons would help to save time negociating often disparate menus.  The camera is not so easy to operate in the dark, some low-level backlighting option for the buttons and controls would be really useful.
9.0|#|All the features, continuing the excellent alpha brand while still working with minolta gear.|#|The only fault I have abe (auto bracket exposure) realy needs to be better  (as in needs to who 5 frames over the +/-3 range) , as it is this product is flawed the saving grace should have been if the hdr function could save as tiff
7.0|#|camera is light and offers many features|#|options. Even automatic is not a choice that does not need settings- unless you want a complicated camera (and really need it) buy a simpler camera.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality and great features. My favorites are panoramic shots and scene selections. Its a great size and weight too, for all its capabilities.|#|For its price, it should come with more accessories as standard. I had to buy a lense protector, screen protector, and carrier case which are all essential kits to preserve the camera and lense.
10.0|#|Everything in this camera is perfect .I love it.Perfect purchase.|#|NO Bad points

8.0|#|Good image quality and video quality can be fantastic. Fairly solid build and decent layout but not pro quality obviously. Good specs and features for the money. Autofocus in video mode very good. Panorama and auto hdr modes very good too.|#|More manual control in video mode, need to sort out issues with using studio lighting in manual mode. A little small for big hands but that can also be a positive in portability stakes. Could also do with a bit higher bitrate in video mode and 24fps.

9.0|#|This is my fifth DSLR. I found the continuous AF during HD video very helpful. There are are some situations where this camera has no competition eg Handheld twilight mode when it compresses 6 images into one. After I purchased this, I have convinced couple of my colleagues to buy one!|#|Cannot find any. I would like to see +/- 2 bracketing for manual HDR.

10.0|#|I only gave this camera a 9 for ease of use because I personally need to read the instruction book.  This in no way means this is a difficult camera to learn, I guess it speaks mor eto my laziness.  LOL  The build quality I only gave a 9 to because honestly, I think it's TOO light!  I know, blasphemy, but I would like it to have a little more heft to it.  It almost feels like a toy.  But this is a blessing when shooting at weird angles, or for extended lengths of time.  So, the things I rated a 9, are really 10's in the real world, but I'm being tough on this review.  In ALL other areas, this camera is WITHOUT QUESTION a 10+ .  It is feature packed, and nothing comes close for the price.  This camera has enabled me to shoot at 10fps (with the proper sd card) for a fraction of what I expected to pay.  The video is smooth and high quality, but I already have a video cam, so this was not the main feature I bought ut for.  GPS tagging is very cool, and useful when you can't remember where a pic was taken, and at what settings.|#|I HATE reading manuals.  I'm an old-school trained photographer delving into the world of digital, and I seem to be relearning how to do things on the DSLR's that I could do instinctively on a manual Hasselblad 500c/m.  But that is to no fault of the camera.  Totally operator induced.

10.0|#|Great looking camera with images to match. the video recording is very good but i think i will need to buy a separate mic attachment due to a little motor noise as it auto focuses when filming. the camera is small compared with other dslr's, the build is very good, just a very nice bit of kit for your money.

8.0|#|very fast, small and light|#|Battery life, no ability to video @ 720p
10.0|#|The camera has SO many great features and options.  It is nice that the different options in the menu have a short description of what that option provides without having to look it up in the manual.  The 10 sots per second burst mode is excellent and really captures the action.  I love the flip screen so you can view the shot from any angle.  The steady-shot helps to keep pictures clear.  The automatic setting allow you to take excellent picture from the beginning without having to become familiar with all the features so you get immediate results and then can learn all the other functions that will give you the ability to produce special affects and professional-quality photos.|#|Although you can take a couple hundred pictures on a single battery charge, the battery life is not so good, so having a backup battery is a must for long photo sessions.  A memory stick was not included with the purchase of the camera, so you have to go out to get one before you can experiment with the camera.  It isn't really clear which memory stick is best.  I purchased a 32GB memory stick that just did not hold the images and when downloaded, the images were damaged.  It is hard to tell which memory will work right.  I do have an 8GB memory stick that seems to work great so far.  I wanted a backup so that if I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading the pictures using an external card reader I will have another to use for further photos.  I have forgotten the memory stick  twice so far.
9.0|#|The 10fps function is brilliant especially for motor sports. The camera just makes it's use such a pleasure as it offers everything at your finger tips. Have purchased the additional zoom lens for the A55, and the picture clarity and quality is tremendous. All in all I haven't had any bad experiences with this camera and would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent SLR camera|#|Too many options to choose from....
9.0|#|In my opinion this is the camera that will worry Nikon and Canon as it is a better product then their equivalent dslr's and sets a new benchmark in the 'advanced user' catagory.|#|Sony do not yet have the large amount of lenses and accessories availiable to Canon or Nikon users (yet!), but unless you have a professional need for them this is not a major worry.
10.0|#|Camera exceeded my expectations.|#|Images are a tad noisy at higher ISO compared to some cameras but nothing most people would worry about.
10.0|#|I *love* this camera, even though I loved my a200 and my a55 as well, Sony's cameras just keep getting better. It's very comfortable to hold and use, image quality is great (the 16-50 is a wonderful lens), and I'm very pleased.|#|None
10.0|#|Good solid feel. This is the first WYSIWYG camera I've ever used, having used and trained staff and students to use, Canon, Nikon, Minolta and Konica. Crisp images. Excellent HDR function and superfast burst mode. I have already invested in more lenses and a flash; all Sony Alpha products. First Class equipment !!|#|Mini Joystick feels a little flimsy.

8.0|#|The camera is well built, easy to hold and offers a wide selection of features. I had previously been using the Sony Nex 5 and was so pleased with the results decided to revert back to using an LSR. The A77 is more versatile and makes photography more interesting and pleasurable.I decided to stick with Sony because I feel this company has the resources and expertise to extend their range of lenses and cameras to become the number one player in this market.|#|There is a shortage of lenses currently available and the G Series is I feel expensive although the image quality is very good.
10.0|#|A really good camera which takes brilliant photos, I love it. The electronic view finder with its various modes is so much better than the mirror on my A350. It is brilliant in low light and shows everything you need.

9.0|#|I've still got to learn a lot about this camera, and about photography in general, but so far I've been more than impressed with this piece of kit and would happily recommend it to anyone.|#|The Sony Alpha lens range still has some major expanding to do, compared to the competition. Although considering Sony have only been in this market a few years, this isn't surprising.
8.0|#|Good build quality and feel. The 12 frames/sec works well (outstanding for the price) but can only shoot a small number of shots (14) before it stops (fine jpg) and the multi angle screen is excellent and can be seen in the brightest (UK) conditions.  The 12-50mm F2.8 lens is super sharp.  The video mode (for those who want it) probably is the easiest to use, with all others (currently) being more 'film maker's tools' and not for shooting the family BBQ.  The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is versatile and OK.  The sweep panarama works brilliantly.|#|However this is in no way a 'bad' camera, it might not just suit everybody.

(I do a lot of cycle race photography and find these items extremely useful)|#|The ease with which you can accidentally  reset the aperture/shutter when using the priority mode and I cannot use the diopter adjustment dial with out accidently starting the video record. The buttons for these two are just too close. The very short battery charge, a battery that would hold it's charge for longer would be very useful.
10.0|#|I have the Sony HVL F58AM flash unit which complements the A77 well and it works well in the Hi speed shooting mode|#|I have only one comment that is the built in flash is too bright and washes out the colours when used in Auto or Auto+ mode this applies to the flash gun as well. It may be me but I cannot seem to reduce the power outputs of either the pop-up flash or the flash gun which can be altered in the other modes

9.0|#||#|at work here just like the A55/A33 (things being unnecessarily disabled to make room for some other product): Why is there is a horizontal crop on the video even when SSS is turned off (the NEX-7 doesn't have that from what I have seen and its the same sensor)??? Disabling autofocus while in PAS modes during video shooting is very annoying. No manual audio level control. As for image quality still needs some work on noise reduction side with RAW.
10.0|#|Image quality up to about 1600 ISO is excellent, after that some noise starts to appear in some of the darker areas. Menus relatively straightforward to follow to make use easy.  Focuses fast and the electronic viewing system is very good.  The 16-50 lens which came with the body is superb.|#|Battery life is very short when using the camera in the real world.  This is very minor point as it is hardly a hardship to have a spare battery.  Have not gone down route of buying a battery grip as I feel this may disturb the current excellent balance and ergonomics of the camera with the 16-50 lens and indeed with the 70-300G lens.

9.0|#|build quality, Simple controls for most of the main settings mean you don't have to go into the menus too much, Weatherproofing is a bonus in difficult conditions, Electronic Viewfinder shows how your picture is going to come out (if you have the time), The bundled 16-50mm f2.8 lens is a fantastic piece of glass.|#|Not all settings can be accessed through dedicated buttons meaning you will have to spend some time in the menus, High ISO performance is noisy, Can be difficult to use in the studio due to the EVF not being as good as an OVF (yet). The flash shoe is still the old non standard type.

Great results straight out of the box.  a vast improvement over the A350 though with pictures that are a vast improvement even in identical conditions - I take a lot of indoor sports pictures.

10.0|#|Image quality and performance are outstanding. Immense amount of features, can customise and control every shot. Cant think why I'd ever need another camera.|#|Bit on the weighty side. Software could use a few tweeks (just personal opinion though) Indexed file deletion would be usefull as number of extraneous shots soon builds up using burst.
9.0|#|I've only had it a few weeks but so far it's great, feels good and solid to hold, nice chunky grip. All dials and buttons 'click' nicely into place. Menu system is good and clear. LCD is big, bright and sharp. EVF is taking some getting used to, but I'm warming to it.|#|Nothing major so far. The memory card cover flap opens a little too easily, sometimes when just walking around with the camera on the strap, it could do with a more positive 'click' to lock. Same goes for the 'Movie' button, I would prefer that to be something like a two button action.

9.0|#|A totally brilliant camera and lens. The EVF shows you exactly what the picture will look like, together with all the information you could possibly want and a live histogram. The rear screen articulation is superb. Great high ISO performance and mega resolution. For best results, make sure you update the firmware to 1.05 if it's still on 1.04. On-camera lens aberration removal for JPEGS also very neat plus loads of other stuff. Read the reviews (the one in Amateur Photographer was very in-depth and sensible).|#|Expensive but the price of the lens does compare well with similar offerings from Nikon and Canon and reviewers tend to rate it above those. Also it's not really expensive for what you're getting which is virtually full frame quality and resolution from an APS-C camera with many revolutionary features.

9.0|#|When switching to different settings, the LCD display will tell you what setting your on and what it is for. The FPS is amazingly fast. Sony has firmware updates unlike Canon, had a firmware update the first month I had the camera. Had a Canon for 7 years and no firmware updates, making the camera seem obsolete 2 years after I got it.|#|Wish Camera Companies in general would make a glass protective cover for LCD display. Sometimes the sweeping panoramic can be fickle and say that it could not capture the moment. Other than that, it is a perfect camera, unless you speak to my husband who is over the moon about his NEX 7 ( talk about a love affair).

The quality of the images are outstanding and it rich feature list makes it a fun camera to use.|#|None, every camera has its limitations but if the Sony has them I have yet to find them getting in the way of my photography.
7.0|#|Well designed ergonomics, buttons well placed and default functionality well chosen, and even better can customise. Picture quality at low ISO is fantastic. Electronic viewfinder is also fantastic, with excellent picture, digital zoom, spirit level and ability to change all camera settings without taking eye away from viewfinder it is in my opinion better than an optical viewfinder. Vibration reduction inside the camera means don't need to buy vibration reduction lenses. No moving mirror so less vibration and quieter operation. Good battery life.|#|When shooting RAW, noise at high ISO (1600 and above) is disappointing. Noise reduction during post processing somewhat recovers the situation but effectively at the expense of resolution (of which admittedly there is plenty). All else being equal I would have preferred fewer megapixels and better high ISO performance. Also disappointed that viewfinder does not show live feed during continous shooting, instead it shows a series of stills, which if I've understood things correctly doesn't make full use of what the SLT technology allows. Also would have liked to be able to bracket in steps of 2 or 3 EV. But guess need some differentiation with the A77. Also need to make clear in documentation that high speed memory card can make a significant difference to the time to write to memory.

Telephoto photography was pointless... I was so dissapointed I returned it for a refund and have now sold all my Sony gear and switched brands.
7.0|#|Fast response time, great tools for manual focusing, AF system good,  large VF where I can see everything without having to keep looking at the back LCD panel.

Excellent Zeiss lenses. Excellent EVF enables you to see clearly in dim light. Fast auto focus on both still and video. Battery life. Solid, good quality feel.|#|Remote sensor on the front only so you have to use a wired remote. No IR focus aid. STUPID bottom hinged screen is restricted on a tripod in portrait mode! Dedicated video button is too easy to press automatically. Picture review is only available in the last mode used so changing from still to video (say) is a long winded, menu hunting process. DOF preview is not very clear on the EVF. Bottom mounted battery access is annoying when using a tripod. 'Blue' effect filter does not recognise bluebells as being 'blue'! It is high time they abandoned the Sony/Minolta hot shoe.
9.0|#|Great feature set.  Low-light pictures are great.  Colours are accurate.  Focus is fast and accurate.|#|GPS takes too long to get a fix meaning that you need to leave the camera on, which reduces battery life substantially.  Battery life is not that great anyway and you really need to carry a spare at all times.
6.0|#|Fast fps shooting and video.|#|Image quality is not up to my expectations, I use RAW and I find it hard to be pleased with the focusing. I have already sent the camera back to be serviced for back focusing but I find spot focusing images always incredibly disappointing even with perfect lighting conditions low iso and a fast shutter speed with images looking fuzzy. In addition, you can't move the spot focus point which is annoying. I've used the camera now for a year and I am just disappointed with the images being just slightly out of focus. I upgraded from an alpha 200 if it wasnt for the lense investment I would of jumped ship by now...

9.0|#|I purchased this an upgrade to my A300 and I've been delighted.|#|The only thing that I would change about the A65 is the way the rear screen tilts/flips - simply allowing the screen to rotate a full 360 would make a big difference.

9.0|#|Small Compact, image quality excellent same as my A 580. Flexiability, lots of legacy ie. my Contax G lenes and Alpha A mount lenes can be used via adaptors. Ideal camera to use on holidays as it does not intrude as a full size DSLR, subjects feel more at ease.|#|Lack of digital viewing adaptor for the 5. Lack of additional external flash for the 5, the supplied one too weak and requires an additional extension at extra cost. extras are too costly.
8.0|#|picture qualityl nice build .easy to handle.|#|very poor menu set up ive been used to canon menues.sony could learn a lot from thease .
9.0|#|Fantastic build and image quality. Compatibility (via adapters) with the full size Sony alpha lens range. Feels, looks and performs like a very high quality product.|#|Across the entire Sony range they seem to leave their customers behind post purchase.

10.0|#|does everything a dslr does but in a beautiful body. Beautifully smooth zoom and focus rings. The touch screen is very high quality. The fact that a super high quality flash that works with seemless ease is just another bonus.|#|the touch screen isnot multi touch. So you cand pinch to zoom etc. Very responsive, colourful glass nonetheless. There could be more fun app style features for those times you want to be lazy and just point and shoot.

8.0|#||#|sometimes the picture quality seems a little random... but that may be me more than the camera!!
10.0|#|I wanted a camera that took great pictures, did most of its work without having to mess around with loads of settings and isn't as bulky as a full sized DSLR, so this camera fits that perfectly and I think it's a great little camera. Well done Sony.|#|I would have liked it to have full auto up to the top ISO rang ( not sure why they don't do that) and the touch screen needs a little practice to be able to control it as its not as good as say an iPhone screen. But don't let that put you off it's a great camera.
8.0|#|As an amateur,I find the camera quite easy to use.ive had it for 8 months,don't get the time to use it a lot,but I've managed to get off using auto,and I am using manual.i find if you stick to the very basic rules of photography,I get a decent pic every time.once you get used to the menu,it's very easy to negotiate through it.but if you start on auto,(point and shoot)you will still get good pics.love the camera.|#|Lenses are few and expensive,no view finder,no hotshot for flash.

9.0|#|Small, lightweight and superb image quality.  Images from this camera can easily match any good entry level SLRs.|#|Supplied flash has limitations and personally I wouldn't use it. Touch screen adds little to the features of the camera.
10.0|#|I had become fed up with carrying a large dslr about and had ,consequently stopped using my camera. Then came the idea to look at csc's. After doing some research I decided that the Sony Nex5n would fit the bill. Good price and it will do everything my dslr would. Picture quality is just as good and it is a lot more convenient to carry around. It has reawakened my passion for photography!|#|None that I can find, some of my friends seem to think it's a backward step but that is just equipment snobbery
10.0|#|Very easy to use as an amateur, special features are the hits snd prompts on the camera.|#|No view finder, you have to paid almost 3/4 of the price of the camera to obtain one.
10.0|#|I dont have a great deal of recent experience with dslr so I cannot relly compare the camera with anything other than phone cams but from a personal point pf view I fing the Nex5n comfortsble to hold easy to operate and I sm more than happy with the quality of the shots I have tsken. It will take me some time to getting around to using all the festures available to me but I will enjoy the process. Only small niggle is the display in bright sunshine almost impossible to see whsts in the frame. Bought the opticle viewfinder but it can only be used properly with certain lenses|#|

The video output is awesome for its size,  the tilting screen I could go on all night but what makes this such a mega camera so go try it for yourselves. I traded in a Canon 500D for this camera and have never once been sorry.|#|none in my eyes.

7.0|#|The combination of multi assignable user shortcut function buttons permits a very high degree of personalisation for instant access to most commonly used functions that require parameter changes (manual/AF focus, ISO, WB, Colour palette, screen info).shortcut function button|#|Video out is restricted to HDMI only - extremely inconvenient requiring an HDMI to composite converter when used with analogue equipment. The image quality is disappointingly soft - both stills and video. General colour balance is pleasing, if a little 'candy', but image sharpness is distinctly lacking. Supplied zoom lens does not inspire confidence because the barrel wobbles when extended to telephoto. OIS (SteadyShot) function is okay but not stunning.

9.0|#||#|Not enough lenses with wide aperture range is available.
9.0|#|Size, weight, build, flexibility|#|No built in flash, viewfinder not recommended to be left on the camera when it is put in the camera bag, which means a fiddly operation every time it is needed.

8.0|#|Small body, good image quality, accurate exposure, some good options (sweep panorama, manual focus aids, auto HDR), tilting screen, film speed range.|#|On/off switch too easy to knock, too dependent on menus rather than physical controls, screen difficult to use in bright sunlight, accessory viewfinder good but very expensive, lenses quite big compared to body. Possible build quality issues - scroll wheel click is losing feel already and is becoming difficult to use.
9.0|#|Excellent quality images, Incredible low light performance, easy to use and light to carry.|#|Difficult to avoid touching the screen when you don't want to. Would benefit from a greater zoom range on the standard lens. (Obviously I can buy a different lens to cure this issue)
9.0|#|Compact. Fantastic image quality. Ease of use. Flexiability. The ability to use A mount lenses, third party manual lenses and via an adaptor my Ziess G mount lenses makes this a well thought out wonderful camera. No back aching huge camera bags to carry around. As good as my Sony 580 without the weight.|#|No external flash connector. No flash if using the EVF. Access to camera functions via menu system over complex. LCD view finder difficult to see image in bright light.
9.0|#|Very nice image quality, easy to read menu, good low light shots, very compact, intelligent auto very good, video quality good and good battery.|#|not very ergonomic for changing settings, iso and shutter speed however; is not a big issue once you get used to, choice of lenses from other vendors not that great at present compare to full DSLRs,  however; compare to similar is brilliant, no viewfinder.

10.0|#|I am very happy with my purchase. pictures are wonderful even in the dark and without flash. at first i wasnt a fan of flash not being built in the camera, but once i start using it, i love this one as it is compact and easy to use, its not in the way. i do not find the camera difficult to use. overall, i love it!|#|

9.0|#|Great pictures even at low light conditions!!! Touch screen is superb,  both in functionality and resolution! Great on-camera help! Very good build quality and relatively easy to carry. Good battery life.|#|Menu could be more user friendly.  Autofocus, although fast enough, could be faster. A built-in flash would also be very welcomed.
10.0|#|I don't like the big digital cameras I find them quite difficult to hold ad operate and heavy somtimes if you are carrying them for long periods so this camera is perfect for me and is just as good if not better.  I love how easy it is to use as  I am not very techanically mind, I love it.|#|I would recommend getting a spare battery as it does drain quickly but that could be more to do with the user as am forever playing around with it.

If you wanted to print it out you would have to print it one page/one link at a time.  Impossible.  Some people like to have a booklet to read that they would perhaps read while on a flight for example.  I am talking about the User manual not the small instruction manual.
10.0|#|Takes good pics and HD video which looks great on my computer, although I've not tried it on the TV yet.  Auto setting takes good pics without me having to think too much.  Takes full resolution photos whilst videoing in HD which I think is brilliant, especially for children's parties and stuff.  Children love the 'illustration' setting which makes any photo on the camera look like someone's drawn it.  Also takes 3D photo's but I've not used this yet.|#|Ease of use and Features scores less than 10 because there are almost too many so potentially a little confusing.

8.0|#|+ Love the art effects!|#|+ Not so good at low-lighting conditions...
8.0|#|Small, easy to use. A fair amount of features.|#|I think it should come with a case as standard. My screen got scratched before I got round to ordering one separately, my fault but that does not take away disappointment. The camera should have a few more in camera special effects, that would be good. The zoom is too quick, and very hard to set at the setting you want, it should have some sort of click increment facility which could be a switchable feature. Other than that I am pleased with my purchase.

3.0|#|Apart from image quality and build quality it's hard to get really enthusiastic about this camera. I reluctantly had to replace my old Sony after my wife accidentally dropped it and it was deemed too expensive to repair. But to be honest I wish I had and had not been talked into buying it by the Sony Centre salesman -- hands up, I know it's completely my fault.|#|Way too many features for me to get to the one I want with any speed. Whilst several are good this little one has so many settings and different features I realise now that by the time I've found the one I want the moment is lost. I also find it so slim that it often slips in my hand just as I'm about to press the shutter. All in all I made a big mistake and am now actively searching for a refurbed model of my old Sony camera and hope to find a buyer for this one - a touch chunkier and a few less features but it's more easily and more quickly navigable.

9.0|#|Very good range of picture taking options|#|its all very well having the instructions etc in the camera but you cannot use them for reference whlist your operating the camera It is stil preferable to have a comprehensive handbook.

The panoramic and HD movie modes also perform very well.  The compact size is great, you can carry it in the palm of your hand easily (but see bad points).|#|The power on/off switch should be recessed or less sensitive as I have on a number of occasions accidentally switched on the camera whilst holding it.

9.0|#||#|Not experienced any with the camera itself.  However I purchased the PVC hard case (£39) to protect the camera and lens and find this a nuisance when trying to remove the camera for use.  I feel that the design of the case should be in two pieces, similar to what Pentax had for their MX camera, way back in the mid 70's.  The one piece design of the case doesn't promote quick removal of the camera from it.

The camera feels well balanced and suitably weighty. (Adding a Gariz leather case increases the quality feel and gives a little bit more to hang on to if you have large mits) The Sony sensor is well regarded and does not disappoint.

I was concerned that this would deteriorate further over time and that dust would be able to get inside, so exchanged the camera.

10.0|#|I bought this to replace the earlier of this model, which unfortunately I dropped.  Anyway, this model has all the features of the earlier model and more. Sony have repositioned some of the buttons to make them less likely to be pressed accidentally, so overall its a better model.  I like the 'in-camera' user instructions, and the video quality is good, although the PC software takes a long time to convert the file to a DVD format that can be viewed on the TV.|#|The pop up flash can be a bit annoying as it pops up every time the camera decides a flash is needed, so you have to remember not to put your finger over the top of the flash when holding the camera.  However, I'm hoping the the position of the flash will minimise the red eye, but I've not yet had it long enough to tell.

10.0|#|I have to say that I am really impressed with this camera. I wanted a new compact digital that could fit in my pocket.  This is not the smallest or slimmest I've had but its not far off it's very neat!  The panoramic shot mode is fantastic and I've had some great images using that.  The only negative and its very minor is the flash position - it pops up where you would tend to hold the camera but you really quickly get used to it.  The 20 x optical zoom is amazing too - it makes it really good for taking on holiday days out instead of my bigger Sony SLR.  All in all really pleased with this.|#|The flash point mentioned above was the only negative for me.

7.0|#||#|The camera in general is good but any one would ask my advice I would recommend not to buy it at all. Simply because any problem would happen after your purchase will be as a losing all you money. I have a problem with this camera. particularly in the lens, there are some dust that make the picture unacceptable particularly in the sun also the camera was fall down and the outer shell have broken a little bit from the top. I sent it for repair and they asked me about 180 pounds to repair it. I cant afford this money so I asked for return. then they asked me 50 pounds for return that they remove it later.Because they don't mention to this fine if I don't want to repair the camera. simply I don't think their repair policy is ethical at all. I don't know how such big company have such polices.

Going to say Sony please take a look at the iPhone panoramic feature
9.0|#|Works fast from off to on, battery life is amazing.|#|Vertical Panorama seems to always end prematurely. Lens cover on the top side seemed to stick when turning camera on.

7.0|#|Its small enough to go in a pocket or handbag. It works remarkably well at short distances and has a long zoom. Image stabalization prevents blurring at high zoom levels. It works well in museums and low-light situations where flash can't be used.|#|Picture quality is sometimes poor at the longest optical zoom (can't tell whether its a stabalization issue or electronic blurring) and the enhanced auto mode is best ignored.

8.0|#|Plenty of features, incl. several presets on the 'top dial', GPS, good zoom. Generally, Sony build quality is good.|#|The user guide doesn't tell you much about how to shoot with manual settings. The dial on the back is very sensitive and settings can be changed too easily by just a slight accidental touch. The pop-up flash tends to be where you would normally hold the camera so sometimes you don't get the flash popped-up, and you also have to shut the camera down to get it back into the camera unless you push it down but this is not advised in the guide.

The camera shop assured me the lens was fine and I just wasn't used to such high definition. I took it back a second time as I think it was a faulty lens.

10.0|#|Build quality|#|A really annoying thing is that the flash is in wrong place on camera body. It is too easy to hold camera above flash so that when the flash comes out of the body your finger stops it from coming out. Far better is my DSC- T10 in this aspect
9.0|#|I love the feel and look of this camera. It feels reassuringly solid and just screams quality. Photo taking is easy too with the quality of the photos - both with and without flash - being consistently better than my previous camera.|#|. In reality, this invariably makes them overly complicated! With the majority of features just not being used or needed by the average user.

Good panorama feature.|#|Takes a little while to change the focus in the viewing screen, but semi-depressing the shutter seems to fix that. Would have been nice to have an out of camera battery charging facility included, that way you can charge a spare whilst using the camera.
7.0|#|With practice the depth of field settings a bonus|#|
8.0|#|Bought to replace a 'Bridge' camera, I was looking for a decent sized zoom in a 'pocketable' camera. So, good points... great zoom in a small package, good anti-shake, lots of scene types and multi-exposure merge modes. Excellent colour rendition, brilliant close focus for macro images. Bright screen that has mostly allayed my fear of not having a viewfinder. Quick startup speed. Battery life is good.  Overall I'm very pleased and the camera is doing what I want.|#|If you zoom right in to a photo you don't see the 'normal' pixels, you see a slightly 'blurry', 'painted' effect.  I don't think that is necessarily bad, just different and how often does one zoom in that closely?
9.0|#|Easy to use,on screen instructions, you can take snap shots when filming, low light sensitivity. I have been very pleased with it.|#|The flash pops up from the top left where I have been use to holding my other camera.
5.0|#||#|I have given the product poor marks because I am very uphappy with only an online manual. Took me 4 hours to print out page by page as it's stored in a heirarchical tree. A convenient booklet to take on holiday would have been a lot better. The manual is not descriptive and I am still struggling to get the best out of my camera as a result. It is taking a lot of time and effort, not what I was expecting for the price.

8.0|#|Great zoom, 20x optical is really good for taking close up shoots. Great upgrade from my previous sony camera. Also love the extra effects that come with the camera (one of the main reasons I choose the Sony over the Nikon): the HDR painting and the partial colour effect|#|A little more bulky than my previous camera, but that's probably to house the zoom. Otherwise not found any bad points yet.

9.0|#|A well specified Travel Zoom camera that just sneaks ahead of the rivals based on my particular needs. I didn't require RAW format, Wifi or the slow motion video tricks that others in this field have. This camera is easy to use and produces stunning results on automatic settings and has enough in the way of manual tweaks to tempt a 'snapper' to be a little more creative. Combined with a good case and a small tripod this is a compact gem and the screen is crystal clear in bright conditions (remember to remove sunglasses!)|#|There is no viewfinder - in fact it isn't technically possible on a zoom camera this size - that took some getting used to but is mitigated by the excellent screen
10.0|#|Simply takes awesome shot when you press the button... I barely use my Nikon digi slr any more|#|
9.0|#|Made in Japan - still a reassuring aspect. Build quality is excellent, display is pin sharp, easy menus, video exceptional and generally a very capable camera which gives the competition a very hard act to follow. Zoom is so quiet and effortless and the macro is very entertaining. With cash-back it is a no-brainer.|#|

Have just come back from Myanmar ( Burma) and I lost photo opportunities as a result of this power draining problem - Sony, get back to the drawing board. DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL - completely unreliable.

9.0|#|All good as far as I'm concerned|#|Not found any yet
9.0|#|So many features to list, the focusing motor is a huge improvement compared to the A35. As yet, i have not found any bad points. As a previous user of the A35, it was very easy to get to grips with the 65. The adjusable viewing screen comes in handy although i do prefer to use the viewfinder, which can display all the information you want which is a bonus compared to other brands. The ability to record in RAW and JPEG at the same time is also a bonus. Very quick processor means you dont have to wait to take another shot. Focusing is very fast and the tracking focus works a dream. I wont be upgrading for a long time.|#|When recording in both RAW and JPEG the max frames per sec is only about 4fps, but if set to either RAW or JPEG only, then full fps are achievable. This is the only down side i could find.

10.0|#|My 1st SLT camera, I have a Panasonic TZ7. The Sony A65 was my next step up the must have camera. As I have owned a Minolta Dynax 7000 film camera since new in 1985, I can use my 70-210 lens and 35-80 lens.The A65 is very good value for money compared to the A77,with not too many less features!I was going to buy the Sony Alpha 580,until the A65 came out! Glad I waited!|#|

Flash coordinates better than the A350.|#|I see there's an update but how does one go about installing the software for an auld man this is quite daunting. To be honest the files are far to big for my old computer it's upgrade everything to co op with them. Over all I like the feel and handling of this camera. The pin missing from where the camera attach to a tripod is a serious error as the camera tends to slacken on the mount because I can't tighten it down enough ''auld age''.

10.0|#|Where to start? The filter effects - brilliant from moody BW to color filter. I don`t always take my laptop with me, so being able to manipulate jpegs in camera is a bonus. The panorama function, great images straight from camera to PC without any S/W manipulation required. The fast burst in continous mode; unbelievable. So fast and yet amazingly quiet. Much quieter than the Alpha 200.|#|Getting extras for the Alpha 65. An extra battery grip would be ideal. I have large -ish hands and the extra size the battery grip provides makes the camera feel more natural to hold.
8.0|#|Excellent viewfinder, very fast frame rate. Smaller and lighter than other cameras with similar features. Very good resolution at lower iso settings, but suffers at higher iso settings.|#|By far my biggest gripe is the dreadful range of the exposure bracketing. Two or three stops either side of zero should be included. Built in HDR does not mean that I dont want the ability to produce HDR images using third party software. A firmware update could fix this, should Sony so desire. On firmware v1.03 it was possible to have video autofocus in S mode (via a few button pushes  info on youtube), but this has been removed in v1.04. Why?

What would be handy is a video done by Sony to show all the features as many including myself use YouTube to find info and support instead of a 100 page manual that can be confusing and hard to take in.|#|3. It would of been great if it had macro's so you could set the camera up for yourself for certain situations.

The HDR is useful on some handheld shots as it seems to sharpen the image as well as increase dynamic range.|#|The stabilisation is not always effective in auto settings. The images are a little soft straight from the camera but a little unsharp mask brings out a lot of detail easily. The manual could be a LOT better. It tends to assume that you already know all the terms and it took me forever to find out how to turn the HDR on and off, or even to zoom into the photos when reviewing them.

For what i have used it for so far ive always been able to get what i need. I havent yet really done alot with it though but have been on holidays etc.

Fast repeat shots if you need them. Simple memory card...|#|Some Minolta lenses dont work and some other brands had issues too. The Electronic display when used in the dark/low light was not good image, but the photo was fine. Like most Sony stuff its typically price fixed worldwide. Includes just one battery. Genuine Batteries are Expensive.

9.0|#|Light and compact, great ergonomics (for me!), access to old Minolta lenses, use of EVF for video is a key advantage over DSLRs. Image quality with kit lens is very good, and even better with a crisp prime. The low res screen is actually fine in use, and the tilting screeen in line with the lens is a boon. The EVF eye sensor is a great feature.|#|Some rolling shutter issues in auto mode video, no 50p video (and that must just be software), the a37M is a better package if you can find one.

There does not seem to be any ingenuity with this newer camera, other than a greater zoom and higher resolution photos, and of course a substantial increase in price.

9.0|#|Easy to use, with automatic smile focus etc, would recommend as good value for money with clear picture output.|#|None found yet but too early to say!
9.0|#|Easy to use, good image quality and some fun effects including a panorama effect.|#|Although these fun effects can be useful and the intelligent auto and program auto functions are useful, I find the have less manual options then I would like. Though I haven't got to grips with this camera fully, so may learn how to alter these further, but from what i can gather, you are restricted regarding manual options, so if you are a professional or keen SLR style photographer, this may not be right for you. Though, if you are just starting out like me, It is a neat simple, easy to use piece of kit to start with. And as with most things, for the best you have to pay more, so for the price this is a great camera apart from the lack of manual control.

10.0|#|Excellent value for money,  did it all!!!|#|
9.0|#|Not too big so great for use when travelling|#|Most things are menu driven rather than having a dedicated button/wheel like my old Cybershot, this generally is fine, but does mean that it can take slightly longer to access some of the features

I would not recommend this camera.I bought this product as i needed a smaller camera but could not afford other products. It is true that you only get what you pay for.

10.0|#|nice camera i have ever seen..|#|
9.0|#|The wide angle lense lets you take group photos in confined spaces and the steadyshot allows you to take pin sharp photos without blurring.|#|Its not so much a bad point but something that might be an improvement. When passing the camera to others to see the photo just taken.  Invariably they use there thumb and forefinger to take hold of the camera and in doing so inadvertantly press the photo button thus loosing the picture.  Re sighting the button to the front or back would avoid this.
10.0|#|nice zooming during recording|#|
9.0|#|Gorgeous looking camera, easy to use, great picture quality. Was bought as a birthday present and the recipient was really impressed with all of the special features (panoramic view, special effects etc)|#|Only downside is the little switch changing the camera functions to movie/panorama - seemed a little cheap/poor quality compared to the rest of the camera.
8.0|#|The camera is easy to use and takes very high quality pictures. It is slim and fits in your pocket easily.|#|The camera takes marginally longer to take the picture than my last camera which meant initially I lowered the camera before the photo was taken. I find the setting menus to be a little confusing regarding the size and quality of photo.
9.0|#|Size - weight - Print colour -  love that you can pick out colours but it does take me a few minutes to do it (but maybe thats because I dont remember things as easily anymore|#|I dont like having to take the battery out of the camera to recharge it
9.0|#|only think is would have liked a view finder as well as the screen like my old sony cyber shot, however this is very compact and slim. very pleased with it.|#|
7.0|#|Excellent zoom lense. Small size.|#|not as easy to use as the Samsung it replaced.
8.0|#|good value for money|#|Without being over-critical, the build seems a bit fragile. It would of been have to have included a case with this product.
9.0|#|Being waterproof may be a novelty but is excellent fun on holiday. The main plus point is the small size, it really does fit in your pocket. Combined with the excellent build quality it's hard to beat!|#|It's a high price to pay for a compact.
10.0|#|Perfect for what I needed it for a simply yet very sturdy compact camera.|#|The openers for the battery, memory card and cables seem very flimsy and they have to be left open when charging etc.

1.0|#|none|#|Bought to take on holiday, sadly went to charge it and it does not work. The RED error light appears and nothing happens. Extremely disappointed with this purchase and I will be looking to get a FULL REFUND upon my return to the UK. This has ruined my holiday and I now have to purchase another FULLY WORKING camera whilst abroad! Absolute waste of money
7.0|#|Slim and Fab pic quaility|#|Says drop proof but case is really thin and doesnt look like it will stand up to much and the bad feature is the slide down front which covers the lens as you slide it up and down and already after only 2 weeks its scratching the front of the camera
9.0|#|High Quality Images, Wide Range of Features, Quick Capture, Lightweight, Nice Feel|#|Capability for the lens to be scratched by the sliding cover, Not good for low light scenes, In my opinion more water resistant than ''Waterproof'', The touch feature doesn't always respond very well, Can't always find the right feature for a certain scene
9.0|#|Very easy to use and can produce excellent quality images under the right conditions.  Generally a good menu system and precise focussing system.|#|It is too easy to open the shutter cover.... Thankfully the startup tune is loud so it hasn't flattened the battery.... yet.
10.0|#|It is very light and compact yet robust too. Wonderful underwater and late night shots, better than my large expensive camera.   Battery life is excellent.|#|I don't think there are any bad points, i keep it with me all the time now. Maybe just the pause between shots but I could turn it to continuos to overcome this.
10.0|#|Light and easy to carry around for a camera with great image quality!|#|The software can be slow at times particularly in dark light situations.
10.0|#|I haven't had the camera that long, but it shoots excellent pictures. Love the panoramic feature!|#|Switching modes seem a bit longwinded - or is it just that I don't get it?
10.0|#|A small take anywhere camera, that can take a bit of rough handling. Great looking images. Particularly impressed with hand held twilight, used in low light.|#|Price. Touch screen, not as responsive as I would like on occasion, especially when screen is wet.
8.0|#|Small pocket size camera that takes great photos and video with good features. Ideal for everyday use when I don't want to carry my DSLR about.|#|Haven't found any yet.

10.0|#|Perfect size for good quality photos without needing a full SLR|#|
10.0|#|Everything. Does exactly what a bridge camera should do and does it well from the 3D imaging to the self stitching panoramic view to HD video. I just can't fault this camera.|#|No memory card supplied and you really need a high capacity class 10 SD card writing at at least 30 preferably 45 to do the HD video shoot justice.
10.0|#|fast autofocus, fast start up, good image quality, great video and ability to take stills while recording. Auto sensing eyepiece viewfinder which switches off LCD screen|#|no RAW
9.0|#|Really enjoy using the camera and it has given some amazing shots.  Like the optical and digital facility|#|Would have like a hard copy manual so that I could have checked out the features of the camera in use instead of having to go in and out of the menu all the time.  I know its not a big deal but would have made it easier for an amateur
10.0|#|Quick start up, super fast zooming and superbly easy to use giving fantastic results virtually every time. Every feature any hobby photographer could ever need and more producing DSLR shots with great ease. Researched the market heavily before choosing SONY and this model and have been thoroughly impressed from day one - a truly superb camera.|#|I don't need raw but I know other people, who even at this level would like RAW as an option - maybe available with the next model. Otherwise I can't find anything wrong or anything amiss with this camera.
10.0|#|a simple, easy to use camera that looks great and takes great photos.after doing lots of research on the internet this is the one i opted for and was not dissapointed|#|none so far
9.0|#|Excellent range of features, lightweight and easy to use.|#|Delay after capture of picture especially when using the clear image zoom feature. This is accentuated when burst mode is used.
10.0|#|Camera has a host of useful features and picture quality is outstanding, the digital zoom is impressive. In summary a comprehensive camera in a compact body.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|Great price (relative to competition and for what you get), easy to use, easy to carry/handle and shoots high quality photos and video. 30x zoom makes a big difference. Automatic settings cover all the bases but the camera also allows for manual adjustment for everything. Has really inspired me to get more involved in photography and capturing great moments.  Really happy, Superb!|#|None, its fantastic.
9.0|#|Compact, robust bridge camera which is comfortable in the hand. The auto viewfinder is an excellent feature as is the adjustable LCD screen. The zoom and image stabilization are excellent. As with the 18 mp photos the HD movie quality is outstanding and so easy to use for a non cine camera. For the amateur photographer looking for pin sharp pictures and film without the complexity of an SLR look no further.|#|I purchased this camera because I have always owned Sony products as I believe they are premium products. This is an excellent camera, more expensive than its rivals let down by the control button positions.
9.0|#|Bought it specifically for the zoom as we were going on a trip to Ecuador's Galapagos Islands and Amazon Rainforest. Achieved amazingly good photographs of wildlife with high quality resolution and detail even at considerable distance and without a tripod.  Macro photographs of insects and frogs were sharp and showed the finest of detail.|#|It has a built in operating guide which is good and easy to follow with good eyes but I would prefer a small paper manual to study at leisure.  I wear glasses for reading but not for taking photographs so found it inconvienient having to dig out my glasses when I wanted to work out how to use different functions. With a good old fashioned manual I feel I would have become familiar with my camera much faster.
10.0|#|This is the best Bridge camera you can buy in my opinion. If you are moving from a Sony Cybershot the menus are logical- if not invest time in getting to know all the functions and use the on line manual. It's time well spent.  The zoom lens and creative options are superb. You can go outside the Auto modes and take fantastic pictures. You CAN use filters- go to EBay and buy the adapter ring made in the Uk. This will allow you fit Hoya filters like I have and make a great camera even better. For what I want- no need to buy a DSLR.|#|Nothing.
9.0|#|Better than the other competitors in my view|#|Could do with thread for attaching filters, etc.
10.0|#||#|As the lens on this camera is NOT interchangeable, i would have thought you could purchase a filter direct from a sony outlet, as if the lens gets scratched on a beach for example, its pretty much scrap, there is a place you can by an adapter kit though, which has these and a hood. Also would have been nice to have the option to add an external flash and mic, but to be fair the sound from recordings is very good. Wifi would also be a benefit as alot of cameras with similar specs have this, but i suppose it does not hurt pluggin it in with HDMI lead, playback is excellent
8.0|#|Great picture quality. Compact.|#|Battery doesn't last long. Cannot use a new memory card with it, as you need to configure it and I could not find how to do that. I had to use an existing memory card from another of my cameras.
9.0|#|Fantastic image quality and vidio quality. Using intelegent auto setting I have taken pictures in lighting conditions which I would never have contemplated with beautiful results. The vidio of our trip to Rome which was why I bought a new camera is just great. The in camera instructions are very thourgh and so good to have with you at all times! Cos I am 71 and not as bright as yesteryear.|#|The lens cap attatchment -just a bit of cord tied to the neck strap is a bit off, I like my oldler Sony better with the built in lense protection.
10.0|#|As a novice, even I found this camera easy to use.  The instruction booklet is straight to the point.|#|
10.0|#|Easy to use. Lots of features to use. Video quality and ease of use is stunning. Still photos are very good, Intelligent Auto makes my photos feel like I'm a Pro., which I am most definately, not!! As for the zoom, if you need to spy on someone, this'll get you right next to them.|#|when shooting stills. I don't want to see what I've just taken. I'd rather be focusing on my next photograph. Can this be removed, or will it always show your last picture??
10.0|#|Great pictures terrific zoom feature easy to use|#|Some menu options difficult to find, still have not been able to find the black and white option

9.0|#|It really is easy to use I am a point and shoot man and really haven't used all the options I could but still taken some really good photos|#|maybe the red eye
9.0|#|Have achieved some excellent results with the camera, wide range of focal lengths mean it is the ideal choice when you don't want to go out with SLR and selection of lenses.|#|Software not up to Nikon or Canon standards, bit vague regarding GPS.
9.0|#|Very good for the amateur use. It is virtually impossible to take a bad picture! A pleasure to use, fast, clear, perfect pictures - What more can you ask for!|#|No telephoto option or ability to add further lenses. However, the existing lens, does cover a wide range. At maximum zoom (Inc. Digital,) makes a pixelated picture. No good for enlarging / cropping purposes
8.0|#|Auto eye view finder|#|
8.0|#|It takes sharper images than my previous Panasonic camera and the zoom lens is 100% better.|#|Have not discovered how to down load a whole manual for this camera.
8.0|#|In general, I have been very pleased with the results from this camera.  It was bought as an adjunct to a DSLR which had become somewhat heavy to carry round with multiple lenses, and I used it intensively on a four-day trip to the Netherlands.  It is light and reasonably compact with an excellent zoom range where the ring-controlled zoom offers fine control.  The GPS is effective outdoors and the swivel finder is handy.  Spare batteries are easy to obtain and 3rd-party brands are reasonably priced.|#|No printed manual or PDF.  You might want to take a spare battery for busy days.  Some features too complex.  810 mm zoom can be affected by atmospheric conditions.  Would prefer slightly wider wide-angle.  18 Mpix is really too many for the sensor size.  EVF quality poor at this price level.  Batteries seem to discharge even with the camera off - more so than just Li-ion self-discharge.  No separate charger is supplied, but this wasn't the disadvantage I thought it might be.
8.0|#|Image quality and zoom|#|Instructions difficult to find within camera.  Would be far easier to have printed instruction book.
9.0|#|Easy to use and on the right setting captures great images.|#|setting photos, you'll have to wait between shots, but the quality this setting produces is what you get for your patience.  Pick your moment carefully.
9.0|#|very good picture quality|#|no handbook to refer to
9.0|#||#|Lens cap has to be removed before switching on. Paper or PDF manual not adequate.
7.0|#|Ease of moving round built in handbook and settings|#|It is worrying that the lens barrel feels loose. Have tried several examples in shops and seem to be similar. Possibly because of complex movements during zoom. Other makes do not seem to do this. Is it technical necessity or poor build quality?
9.0|#|Takes really beautiful photographs, if you're a 'Pixel' person looking for mega size blow ups of course you'll be somewhat disappointed.   This little Camera is so versatile with its 30x zoom and light weight, makes it worth having.|#|I had this Camera for just over a month, and did not used it much, but I started to noticed the lens assembly making a slight 'knocking' sound when retracted and the camera is inverted or moved about (camera switched off). Because the fault did not make itself immediately apparent, my option to return this Camera to the supplier  for an exchange had expired because I had it over 30 days.  I cannot even begin to tell you how annoyed I was at having to return a product so soon for this concern, the shear inconvenience and nuisance of it all just erodes the joy of buying a new product. However, the returns process was  relatively easy (Free Post) and the repair was excellent.
9.0|#|Some very good HD movies|#|Sockets for battery charger and USB cable a bit fiddly

9.0|#|Love it.  Had an erly version and when it died I had to get a new one.  Prefer it to my canon 400d and the Sony nex 5.  The zoom range on one lens makes it easy to use and really good at low light shots|#|
10.0|#|This camera is incredibly easy to use and has fantastic image quality. I bought it especially for taking photo's of wildlife, particularly birds, and the 30x zoom is perfect for the job.|#|It's a little difficult to hold on the left side of the camera body as there isn't really anywhere to grip.

9.0|#|With virtually no familiarisation time, I took the camera on an important holiday and was able to take some magnificent photos.

10.0|#|Many effects to change colour etc prior to taking a shot and also some others for tweaking after a shot.|#|Can't think of any really... But if I did have to pick two things it would be that the viewfinder is the clearest when using (not that I ever do) and also that the lens cap will pop off when the camera is turned on if not removed beforehand, even when just viewing images.
9.0|#|Image quality - Zoom - Auto focus - Camera weight - for me it has many good points|#|and for me the most disappointing is that I am not able to use a remote to take photographs

8.0|#|Very easy to use. Good image quality. Easy to transfer images to multiple platforms. Battery life clearly shown on screen.|#|No RAW format shooting. Only goes up to f8 aperture, so have to rely on shutter speed on bright days. Sometimes difficult to see movement between apertures and shutter speeds.
10.0|#|Best camera ever! I wanted a camera that would give great results when taking pictures of my children. Having a toddler and a ner baby I needed a camera that wouldn't take blurred pictures when the boys move like previous digital cameras have done to my annoyance. This camera does exactly what I want it to giving clear, bright and non-blurry images. I am very impressed and would recommend to anyone.|#|None!

10.0|#|Excellent and forgiving zoom|#|Lag between taking shot and being able to take another, I think that could be the write speed of the card possibly
9.0|#|!|#|Menu system very complex- thats the nature of the beast,  all sophisticated electronic items are the same, no way round it I suppose- I have a hard time remebering where certain settings are when out in the field. That is a general thing and in no way is criticising this particular camera.
10.0|#|5)The weight and balance feel right in the grip|#|The camera is large and heavy as most are of this quality, and has a plastic feel to it. The  Sony LCJ-HJ case is cumbersome, with the Lowepro Rezo TLZ10 giving adequate protection and easily removed /replaced.
9.0|#|I am not a photographer at all but this camera allows me to take beautiful pictures. Since buying it about a month ago I have been on holiday to France. I used the camera for taking action shots of my children playing, the scenery and chateaux, in low light (which is perhaps not it's forte but equally I'm still learning) and at zoos. It is great for taking focused shots with blurred backgrounds an equally good at blurring out the mesh fences at zoos.|#|Although you are able to switch everything to manual it still tries to 'help' with certain things. The manual focus only appears to work in certain modes and i haven't found a manual macro setting so the camera decides if it's macro or not which makes it difficult to take close up images in focus.

10.0|#|Great build quality, easy to use, even in manual shooting mode, fantastic image quality and functionality,amazing zoom capability,great battery life too.|#|Just one thing,easy to accidentally turn on with lens cap in place, that's it.
10.0|#|the picture and video quality is amazing, plus the zoom on the camera is unbelievable.|#|your not told you have to use a class 10 memory card when you purchase it so it was frustrating to only find that out after damaging a few memory cards first.
9.0|#|It is really easy to use whether you choose to use fully automatic or fully manual.  The optical zoom is impressive but the resolution seems to drop at the higher magnitudes, especially in poorer light.|#|The most irritating thing for me is that I cannot attach the lens cap to the camera (other than protecting the lens), something that is very useful when I drop the cover whilst trying to remove/replace the cap.

10.0|#|Ease of use is fairly good but it does take a while to learn. There is a mode for most conceivable requirements.|#|
8.0|#|Up to now I am pleased with the results especially the image stableizer.|#|The only bad point is that there is no screen protector and I have already scratched the screen. My hobby means that the camera has to compete with binoculars and telescope, therefore needs to be very robust. I regret not going for the alternative which had a folding screen, thus enabling it to be  completely protected when not in use.  Birdwatchers beware.
9.0|#|Excellent Bridge camera previously used Cannon 60D DLSR due weakness in right arm became to heavy hold changed to Sony DSC-HX200V solved all problems of weight but gives almost as good results|#|This has been overcome by fitting adapter ring not the perfect solution but works very well.

Sony's Play Memories can read AVCHD but can't read my movies in other formats (eg jpeg movies) taken by my previous (non Sony) cameras.

Lens cap gets pinched when the camera is turned on if you forget to remove it first.
2.0|#|This camera had, on paper, everything I was looking for, being compact with excellent zoom capabilities (although that is partly digital) and features such as GPS tagging as I intended to take it traveling. It has a quality feel to it and promised to offer the convenience of a compact camera in terms of being small and light with some of the features of an SLR. The flip out back screen is a very nice touch.|#|First thing to say is that some of the features can only be accessed via a bit of a tortuous menu system. Not a deal breaker, but time consuming and a bit of a pain. However I was very disappointed by the image quality. I was not expecting SLR performance - that would be unreasonable from the smaller sensor in the Sony - but from my first few pictures I felt it struggled to produce reasonable quality photos. They'd be OK if you wanted to take take quick holiday snaps, but then if that was your aim you'd probably have bought a smaller compact. To give a comparison I think I got better results on my Nokia N8 mobile phone than I did with this Sony. Particularly (but not exclusively) in lower light the pictures became of low quality. At worst they seemed to have an effect a bit like an oil painting, which I can only guess was due to some kind of processing going on in the camera to offset the small sensor. Whatever the reason, in the end I reluctantly returned mine to the store for a refund, feeling somewhat let down by Sony on this occasion. Had the picture quality been better I would have been very happy with the camera, but unfortunately it just wasn't good enough. I get the impression that to pack as many features in for the price they have had to scrimp on the basic thing a camera should do well.
8.0|#|Pictures are great|#|Screen tilts but would be better if it could be rotated or on an arm
9.0|#|Image quality, great zoom - controlled by a wheel on the lens barrel rather than a switch on top of the camera makes it so much more useable, clear viewfinder and LCD screen, great low-light images especially when the 'twilight' function is used.|#|The number of options/menus can be confusing at first.  On my first outing with the camera, I wanted to take a panoramic shot but couldn't find the panorama function!  Easy when you know how though.  The camera can be as easy or complicated as you need - It can do everything, or you can.
9.0|#|This is a very versatile camera aimed at the amateur market I feel. I have absolutely no experience of photography but have produced some very lovely work necessary during a course I attended.|#|Like a lot of other brands, it does not come with its own handy instruction book, the instructions are built into the camera, so unless you actually know what you are looking for this is a bit pointless. Sony say its in their eco policy, but somebody has to download the instructions from the web site ad it will have to be me, so where are the trees that are being saved from this excercise, its about money....

9.0|#|The whole thing.|#|If you have the lens cap on, and turn camera on, the lens pushes the lens cap off - so you have to remember to take the lens cap off before turning the camera on. Minor but annoying.

10.0|#|Excellent zoom, Excellent Photo's, brilliant CMOS sensor which is really good in low light without using flash, An excellent camera for those wanting to move up from a point and shoot but don't want a DSLR. Has a onboard manual if you get stuck. It is also a 3D camera, has panorama sweep and 3D panorama sweep.|#|Doesn't have a lens attachment to put on a UV filter or fish eye lens a uv filter doubles up to protect your lens but alls not lost there are some companies that make lens adapters to enable you to put on a UV filter.

8.0|#|The Zoom is fantastic for reach.  The Gps is accurate, fairly quick at obtaing a good fix.  Image quality is good for the size of sensor, but increasing this to APS-C would make this camera worth an extra 80 to 100 pounds.|#|The near focussing for macro is not good.  Minimum focussing distance must be close to a metre.

9.0|#|I just can't seem to put the camera down. I live next to a river with lots of wildlife, herons, cormorants, kingfishers, otters etc. so what a wonderful tool this camera is to capture them in their natural environment. I have even managed to make a short film, I teach tai chi and found it very easy to make short clips of the moves for my students. Moving up from a basic point and shoot camera this makes a very easy transition and has deepened my enthusiasm for photography. I feel that this camera offers exceptional value for money.|#|I honestly cannot think of any.

I had heard that the camera had some new features that would make my life a little easier and I must admit I'm not dissapointed. I looked and had a try of the A77 but thought it was too pricey and along came the A57 with just as good features and a lot less money. I have used the camera quiet a lot and the quality of the picture does not dissapoint, its easy to use and there are good references to let you know about certain types of pictures that can be taken. The reference guide is in my opinion much more improved from the other two camera's that I own. Great camera, would recommend it to my friends.|#|Not came across any to mention and I have has a good go with this camera up to the pointof writing this feedback.....

For the difference in cost between the A57 and A65, surely the A57 could have been a 24,000,000 camera? Other than that, no bad points whatsoever.

9.0|#|Compared to the other makes of camera in this class, the Sony A57 is a very well specified camera with great image quality and is easy to use. EVF is fine. Lots of useful features that make it a good all rounder. The kit lens is ok and it gives decent results; but this camera does need to be coupled with some higher quality lenses to get the best images out of it. Overall recommended.|#|The firmware could be improved - in full auto I noticed that the camera has a tendency to get the flash out in lighting conditions where it shouldn't be needed by a camera at this level. Overall no major complaints.
9.0|#|Already though it's apparent the image quality is incredible. Very good contrast and pleasing colours. The advanced features are useful and straight forward to use. I so far can only recommend this camera.|#|No negative points yet, so far more than impressed. The only draw back is price slighty higher than competitors.

8.0|#|IQ obtained with a good lens is good. It feels light in the hand and ergonomically is good. The 16Mp sensor does not show up flaws in lesser lenses as much as the 24 sensor does on the A77 and even more so on the A99.  Not sure whether this is good or bad - depends on your point of view.|#|feel to them. Obviously there is a difference in cost between these camera bodies. The body definitely does feel as solid as the A77 or A99 - again though cost implications here.
10.0|#|Nice size and weight, feels quality. The latest model is to small and cramped|#|Poor build quality of the kit lens.  Works very well but feels fragile with the plastic mount, really making the lens feel cheap and nasty.
10.0|#|Having had a Sony Alpha 100 up to this point, I can only compare the A57 to the A100. The basic controls are very similar making the A57 easy to use. The lens mount is also the same as the A100 which means I don't have to buy new lenses. The larger screen which shows all the shooting information is able to tilt and also twist making it less prone to any damage, which is good, the various buttons on the camera are easily located which is an improvement from the A100 (had to go into the menu to locate continious shooting for example), the menu itself is very good and makes it extremely easy to set the camera up to your own preferences for any given situation. The build quality is very good and it fits nicely into my not too large hands. It is also lighter than the A100 which surprised me. I can't comment on the panoramic and 3D features, as I haven't used them yet. Overall, it has everything I could want from a camera making it ideal for me to use going towards retirement. I think if was more complicated to use then it wouldn't be half as good and I probably wouldn't have spent the money buying it.|#|As far as I can see, there are no bad points
8.0|#|Simple to use, includes a great scene shooter and very pleased with results|#|Would have researched a higher quality lens if I had the knowledge at the time.

8.0|#|lot of nice feture|#|still limited in front a film srl !
9.0|#|The camera is very light. It also feels comfortable in the hand. The autofocus is exceptionally fast. I haven't tried everything on the camera, and don't suppose I will ever use some of the programs. I find the preview button very useful in macro work. So all in all  I'm a very happy chap.|#|The only bad point That I can find wrong is There is no BATTERY GRIP as an accessory with this camera. I have the A350 and find the grip invaluable in vertical mode. BUT THAT'S ALL
10.0|#|This is the next step up for me but I find the Sony to be very easy to use.  Even when you don't quite know what your doing you get a good picture/video.  Light to hold and well balanced it makes you want to go out and take photos.|#|Had it since October 2012 and can't really think of any.  Except to say I am only using the lens the camera came with at the moment but if I buy another (which is highly probable) there is no rear lens cap and this seem a bit miserly by Sony.

8.0|#|Great video quality and options, 50p video, quick autofocus, audio input, fast burst shooting speed, viewfinder during video, HDMI liveview, stereo onboard microphone, low noise at high iso, great build quality, reasonably/competitively priced|#|No audio output jack, no uncompressed hdmi stream, proprietary hot shoe, lower quality digital viewfinder (although this was known before buying), no audio control settings (AGC SWITCH PLEASE!!!), loud lense picked up in footage, flip out screen blocked by tripod due to position of hinge.

10.0|#|Compatible with my Minolta Lenses.  Light for a DLSR.  Picture quality good.  Automatic programmes work well.   Easy to switch between still and video photography.|#|Can be difficult to find your way through all the settings if you want to move away from the automatic programmes.  Could do with a better manual.  Had to upgrade to Adobe Lightrooom 4 for compatiblity with RAW files.
9.0|#|The panoramic shot, especially the 3D are fantastic.|#|Loss of GPS marking.
9.0|#|Low light performance is fantastic with acceptable grain at 3200 ISO allowing sharp handheld images under dim indoor lights.|#|JPEG compression can be seen when looking at photos at actual size on screen. Most probably won't notice it and professionals will probably spend most time shooting RAW where it won't be an issue.
8.0|#|Good ergonomics,comfortable to hold.Excellant picture on screen.Fine tuning of white balance inall modes.Constant focus.|#|Slow focus on plainsurface and in low light.Cannot use Handbook because it is in a foreign language.This may be due to the Windows Vista proramme on my computer.Is a copy via Email or post possible?
10.0|#|Excellent semi-professional camera. Feature-packed camera with full automatic settings but having the facility of complete manual overide. This is an ideal camera for someone wanting to move into DSLR photography or for an upgrade from a compact camera.|#|There are no obvious bad points. Sony is a good brand name and the features provided are on a par with other well-known brand name cameras.
10.0|#|Easy to use. Great range of features. Stone image quality for the price|#|Perhaps would like to have the ability to mutiple-expose as an option - have yet to find that

9.0|#|Excellent image quality...use Minolta legacy lenses|#|Video quality could be better
9.0|#|I am still learning about all its functions etc but have found it a very easy camera to use and it provides a good fps burst rate which I like as I try to take Wild life action pictures. Main function buttons for changing white balance, drive mode etc are easily to hand once I realized they were there. I enjoy using the camera. The Price was also a great consideration|#|Having bought a Kit with body and 18-55 lens. I find the gap between the 55mm end and the telephoto at 70mm annoying. When I bought my original Sony Alpha 300 the standard zoom was 18-75mm which bridged the gap well. I wonder why it has been reduced - probably in the hopes we will buy more lenses

8.0|#|This is my first digital SLR Camera so I haven't got much to compare it with except my old compact. However I have generally found it easy to learn the new functions and easy to get it to do what I want. It feels solid and well made and my pictures look better than before.|#|The only bad point I've found is the auto-focus on the video camera. Its very quick- but that makes it jumpy, and the noise is picked up by the microphone. However manuel focus is easy and looks much nicer on playback
7.0|#|Good handling, easy to use.|#|EVF could be clearer
8.0|#|Bought to be a 1stop shop type of dslr.I needed interchangeable lens function but also auto follow focus for video.This camera fitted the spec.Performs auto focus in video pretty well,better than Canon ,Nikon etc,Still image quality good so far.Lots of extra modes that seem to work OK.Overall I would buy this again.|#|Menu's a little cumbersome,when reviewing images/video you have to select the correct folder first,can't review globally.I keep missing the dedicated movie button,which is too close to another on the top and miss a bit of video,but that'a probably just me.Battery life a bit short.

10.0|#|Good Value for money. Image quality is OK.|#|None
8.0|#|Lots of features to dabble with or if you want flip it to auto use is as a point and shoot. The built in flash is a real bonus. The HD video quality is superb. The quality lens with image stabilisation is really  apparent, especially in low light conditions. The NEX-F3 camera is light, the weight is in the lens. The ability to change lenses makes it really adaptable. Also the programmable 'soft keys' are good. (see the bad points) . The battery holds a good charge too. I did buy another one for backup and a battery charger. A good value for money camera.|#|A few grumbles, saying that, only minor ones. I think sony did a bit of a cheapskate job with charging the battery still in the camera as standard. I did not like the tiny USB connection on the camera, it seems rather flimsy for continual use. To get over this I bought an external charger and battery. It's up to you, but there are non Sony chargers and batteries available, have a look on Ebay or Amazon to see the price range. - Another grumble and I think I will get over this with constant use. Most of the functions are menu driven, so not intuitive to start with. You can programme a few 'soft keys' to short cut to the functions you would use often. I knew this before I bought the camera via reviews. The last moan is, I would have liked the viewing screen to tilt down more. It flips up to 180deg to take self portraits, but down only about 10deg. I think down would have been better for viewing 'over the head' shots. I would use that situation more.But that is personal to what you would use the camera for. Again, I knew this via reviews. So I can live with that.
5.0|#|Generally easy to use.|#|Picture quality with the supplied lens is in my view poor (Too blue in colour) and difficult to correct in the camera)

Prefer the separate battery charger where you can be charging a second battery and using the camera.... with the NEX5R you cannot use the camera whilst battery charging....
9.0|#|Great image quality, light, small, very portable. Great build quality.|#|Touch screen interface can be fiddly. Some of the features are difficult to use: panorama is very picky about how fast you move the phone and it's not clear how to stop it half way through. The online app download process is painful - signing up with the Sony Entertainment Network on a phone is horrible and there aren't many apps available.
9.0|#|Additional controls help remove some of the effort of digging into the camera's menus in order to find the essential setting you need at that crucial moment.|#|Really the only bad point that I now find with the camera is the lack of a viewfinder - I didn't find this to be an issue when first using the NEX-5N camera, but now that I am looking shoot in a large range of situations, I have found that the LCD screen can sometimes be difficult to see in very bright weather. However, the 'sunny weather' setting does help to make up for that much of the time.
10.0|#|The Intelligent Auto+ has some useful additions to the standard Intelligent Auto, but can be slightly odd if it suddenly takes multiple images (for HDR photos) when you're not expecting it.|#|Camera is slightly small. I'm used to the NEX-7 which has a bigger grip  and the control dial is slightly further to the left. On the NEX-5R the way I hold the camera meant my palm kept hitting the right side of the control dial, which caused (in auto mode) and error message which I had to clear by pressing OK.
7.0|#|Compact size. Quality results without flash in the poor light.  Fast and relatively accurate autofocus. The numbers of suppliers of aftermarket accessories. My main consideration was the NEX 5R [and 5N] ability to use the 13 of my Nikon manual lenses with the help of an aftermarket adaptor {I take lot of architectural and industrial photos, as part of my daily work in progress monitoring activities].|#|Poor Menu setup.  The lack of Sony made accessories. The lack of dedicated system lenses. The cost of the few accessories that Sony supplies for this camera.  The cost of applications that Sony offers on their website.
9.0|#|.|#|Maybe it's just me but a quicker way to find Macro mode would be a plus.
10.0|#|Easy to use, hard to take a bad picture! Auto mode is fool proof but manual modes are great too. 18-55 lens is pretty good, I also bought the 55-210 lens which is brilliant. 18-210 would be amazing.|#|Can't really think of any. Except I now want the NEX7!

10.0|#|Awesome intelligent auto functions, which for basic shooting make manual adjustments superfluous. It also has fantastic low light capabilities without a flash, due to the ISO range. The panoramic mode is also great. Despite the small size of the camera body, it is pretty well balanced, even with the 55-210mm.|#|In manual modes, the number of function buttons and dials (plus the touch screen) can be a bit confusing at first. In time it becomes easier, though. The body sometimes feels a bit slippery and I am only really happy when it's on a neck strap.

7.0|#|Excellent flipable LCD screen lets you view the image you're taking, at the most convenient angle in relation to ambient light (i.e. the sun). Very compact body avoids need to lug heavy equipment around, when trying to 'travel light'.|#|LCD screen difficult to see in bright sunlight, even when set on maximum brightness setting. Screen too senstive to 'touch' on some occasions, causing one to unwittingly alter screen-changeable settings unintentionally. Mind-blowing number of setting options makes this camera unnecessarily complicated to use and difficult to remember one's way around. Not entirely suitable for an amateur photographer like me. Not sure I would have bought this model if I'd realised its complexity.

9.0|#|6. Very keen price|#|The included user guide is basic and enough to get going BUT it doesn't explain all the icons that appear or how to set your own parameters. It also doesn't explain all the settings on the top dial. The built-in guide is rudimentary and glosses over the need to know how things work or how the camera can be maximised. The on-line guide is exactly the same document with no extra detail.
10.0|#|A very comprehensive device indeed with the simplicity of a snapper and the results of a DSLR costing 3 times as much. Onboard help is very useful for when you're on location for those settings forgotten.|#|User guide booklet is very poor and to be able to get to know the camera and how to use it you have to use the camera and multiple sets of batteries. A real shame to have the device powered just to work out how to use it when that power on life could be more productively used doing what it is intended for, taking good quality photographs.

You need to have a second battery is the only advise I would give - although the battery has a long life.|#|No bad points not really - only thing I would say I had to struggle to get it connected to my PC the first time I used it to get the wifi working - the auto setting just doesn't do it - I had to change the auto to a specific standard to get it to connnect - can't remember what it was called but trial and error worked - it was a three letter name like MPF or something.  The first one I got I thought was faulty but now think it was due to this interface standard problem.

I prefered my earlier Sony for the touch control. Plus I dislike the same sort of ridged catch to open the memory card apeture. My previous Sony had a slide bar that was much easier to use. I find it a hindrance when using macro that the extended lens makes contact with the item I'm photographing. This didn't happen with my earlier Sony, which took superb macro and magnify close up photos.

Lens are good too (15-55 and 55 - 210).  Not as solid a body as my Lieca M8 but has other attributes that take it onto the same level.|#|I find that the movie botton is too close to the thumb rest and have hit it a couple of times by accident.  The mount on the lenses can be a bit fiddlely but I am comparing to the ease of my M8.
8.0|#|Fantastic image quality, lightweight, customisable buttons (once you have figured them out to your needs), adaptors available to fit almost any manual lens mount, excellent focus peaking feature, excellent electronic viewfinder, excellent tracking focus even in video mode and great tiltable screen.|#|Sony need to just add a few firmware upgrades to make the camera truly outstanding, for example add a crank function to playback of video (similar to my nikon p310), and add a few more modes to the custom function buttons to expand every option of the customisable layout.
8.0|#|Portability.  Quality of image.  Build quality, which is very high.  The peak system for manual focus is very useful and works well.|#|Menu arrangement would benefit from some re-thinking - there is a lack of logic in the placement of some items under the chosen headings.

Lots of resolution gives great quality at low to medium ISO's.|#|A compact system needs more compact prime lenses of good quality. Also the lenses need to be black to match the camera, making the appearance more subtle and discrete. The two new Sigma primes for the NEX get the balance of size, quality, appearance and cost pretty much right.

Took back to specialist retailer (where purchased) and they confirmed the sensor was faulty. In the process of obtaining a replacement/having it repaired. Not sure how this will pan out.

9.0|#|Light weight, easy handling and compact (compared to my Nikon DSLR).  Excellent images.|#|Apparent lack or lack of readily available info on obtaining other Sony lenses.  Minor point - lack of hard copy manual.  I had produced a hard copy via the CD_ROM.  Suggest the NEX 7 is not for novices.
4.0|#|The three wheel set up is genius. Really good and wish it was on the SLR I have. It is small and lightweight.|#|Very noisy images, poor focus esp in low light and very difficult to hold stead. This means that many photos are out of focus, something which never happened with my Nikon SLR. Poor white balance - needs constant tinkering with. Wheels are to easily knocked, meaning if you are not hyper observant, your photos can be ruined by your camera being on some  weird setting such as an odd ISO or white balance or whatever, depending on how you have set it up. Finally, the record button - clearly Sony never actually used this camera before releasing it. So sick of the hundreds of 1 sec videos of my feet I keep inadvertantly taking. Such a chore constantly having to stop it recording. Stupid design.
8.0|#|very nice camera -easy to operate as a basic camera. the tremendous clarity of the images recorded is stunning . there is a feeling that the possibilities are endless for an amateur like me . it feels nice and solid . the ability to use existing lens i have yet to explore . it would need a small amount of interest to operate -but rewards you everytime .|#|

I've been pleased enough with the results that I get out of it to ditch my entire Nikon system|#|It's easy to move controls without realising it. Most of the lenses fail to do the sensor justice. I am toying with the Zeiss - but it's a big investment. I have also used a number of manual focus lenses on it but found I got really bad purple fringing which I don't get with other cameras I use them on.

The build quality is excellent, a real joy to use this camera.|#|Lot of money!  The record button is poorly placed, I have lost count of the amount of times I have pressed it unintentionally.  There is no way to customise this button.  Quite annoying!!  Then you have to spend time switching it off, which means you may have lost your shot!

I have both types of camera and have had to duplicate some lens to have them available for both systems. Obviously the NEX lenses are much smaller and lighter than the Alpha lenses are, which would make the alpha system camera easier to take abroad if NEX lens could be used!

8.0|#|it is beautifully built. and the image quality is very good.|#|support is not good. Sony send videos for the new 5. They have had a year to launch this product, they should have on line tutorials. Its a very complex camera. For a primum product I would have expect tutorials either on line or on the CD provided. Also the cd is not completely compatible with apple. I think most people who buy this camera will be using apple products. Its a truly great camera but would like more help with its use.

9.0|#|feature which lets you see the effects of change of shutter speed and aperture, on your image, before you take it....no more guesswork....a brilliant step forward.|#|To my way of thinking there is only one bad point, but it's a biggie. There are too many pixels on that sensor, and this definitely impacts the low light image quality. The image quality is otherwise so good, that had it been able to perform as well as my Fuji X100 in low light, I would have sold the Fuji.....and even my hulking Eos 5D2 would have been under review. As it is, there is still a good reason for keeping the other two. Sony has made a great camera, but with a lower res' sensor, and better low light capability, it could have been a blockbuster....an absolute benchmark... a shame really.

9.0|#|WOW, this camera has astonishing features and its like having a computer inside.  Fantastic in low light and very effective Superior Auto which takes 6 speed shots together then combines them into one photo.  Used the sweep panorama function inside of a museum, photos were awesome.  Excellent wide angle and tele-photo lens.  1080p videos superb also.  Simply the very best camera I have ever owned.|#|No facility for external flash and lens filter.  On / off button is too  sensitive since it easily switches on the camera with only light pressure causing lens to come out, I accidently touched the button when placing it into my camera bag.
8.0|#|It is a 100 different cameras in one small package, excellent for stills and very very high quality video.|#|Would have preferred the wide angle to have been 24mm not 27mm. Shame they went for a such a powerful telephoto rather than start at the very useful 24mm wide angle.
9.0|#|With 16 million pixels you can now use the digital zoom to full effect, I had seen a moon shot so decided to try it out and all I can say is WOW very clear and that was hand held, the image stabiliser kicks in and boom theres your shot I havent had a chance to test it to the max but from what I've seen so far I'm very happy with the HX100V I plan to use the manual settings more but at a pace I feel comfortable with, I wanted more than a point and shoot camera and this looks like it's going to for fill my needs.|#|

I am very pleased with the camera and it performs better than some of the reviews I have read give it credit for. I bought mine especially to take on holiday in SE Asia and I more than happy with the results. Some of the photos I have taken are stunning.
10.0|#|The best camera I have ever used.  It has numerous features that make the camera enormously flexible.  The anti-shake is easily the best I have encountered and the photo quality is out of this world.  I love the automatic mode where the camera chooses the appropriate setting on it's own, just by recognising what it is pointed at, whether a landscape or a face.  The ease of use is astonishing.  Despite all that the camera can do, the user interface is simplicity itself and if you want to, you really can still just point and click!|#|Having upgraded from a six year old 5 megapixel camera the HX100V is heavier, but then it has many more abilities and feels much more rugged than my old one. It is slightly heavier that I might have liked, but is by no means overweight.

7.0|#|sweep panaroma, image quality, movie recording very high quality, very good lense stabilisation, able to take pictures in very low light using AF illuminator coupled with high ISO setting, very good battery life.|#|no raw pictures, PMB software provided with camera is unstable- there were cases where it could not read files inside the camera while trying to load into pc, when lense is at maximum zoom it is very difficult to focus as slight handshake would cause the camera to be very unstable, box did not come with a detailed user manual - this is essential as the camera came with lots of functions.

8.0|#|Easy to use. Combines manual with automatic. Lets me shoot what i want and how i want controlling basics itself.|#|Can't change scene after selecting one particular scene. Have to move the dial back and forth and then select change of scene. Quite irritating.
9.0|#|More user friendly (intuitive) than most other cameras I own  from compacts to pro-am SLR's. Image quality is better than I thought it would be.|#|No facility for attaching filters or lens hoods. Accompanying directions difficult to navigate although it appears some effort has been taken to simplify this. I still haven't found out how to increase the image magnification in manual focus, and I'm not even sure manual focus is working without the image magnification to confirm it.
6.0|#|Excellent video. Good zoom. Reasonably good battery life.|#|The delay between shots is annoying. The macro I can't get to work. The on board manual is for 5 year olds. Suffers from heightened expectations. My old DSC-H7 compares well - the camera I intended to replace!

10.0|#|One of the best cameras i have ever used. At work I am forced to use a Sony DSLR and this camera beats it in everything and with the powerful zoom it can take amazing pictures at greater distances|#|only bad points would be that there isn't a button to turn macro on and off and F stop only goes up to 8.0

6.0|#|Good lens, focus, light balance. Some good scenic modes e.g. hand held twilight, pet, fireworks. Manual focus, super zoom. Panoramic mode.|#|The worse things are the on-screen camera manual. If you want to look something up you have to leave your settings and go up and down the menus to find the information. All of the scene modes, flash settings, folder settings etc are also on-screen instead of being on manual dials/buttons on the camera. It takes ages to scroll through them and find what you want. It also insists on just showing the photos taken on most recent day and this remains the default regardless of what you want i.e. by folder. I would not recommend.
5.0|#|Good macro|#|Cramming a billion billion billion pixels onto a sensor the size of a gnat inevitably leads to a large amount of noise, making a lot of photographs pretty unusable. For me the image quality on this camera is actually worse than that on a Sony camera I owned and loved 5 or 6 years ago.
9.0|#|The image quality is astounding as is the zoom lens.I took a photograph of an airliner flying overhead at 20.000 ft plus with full zoom and when cropped you can clearly see Virgin Atlantic written on the underside of the fuselage.Absolutely amasing.|#|The battery is under powered Start up is slow.Video button is difficult to access when using the viewfinder.
8.0|#|It does a lot of things, great zoom and works well for Macro, a lot more to learn|#|No booklet to go with it, everything is on the camera, but no real instruction book that I can pick up and put down wherever I am, I find that very frustrating so it will take me a long time to work out what it can do :o(
7.0|#|Great camera - excellent video camera and relatively easy to use.  Photos have great colour and the zoom is brilliant.  Overall a great camera.|#|A bit hard to focus on close ups.

8.0|#|My primary interest is making short movies and I bought the camera so that I'd got an alternative to my Sony luggable cam when out walking/sightseeing. I also wanted a decent still camera for bird watching/family snaps etc and because sometimes I use stills in my films. So my requirements may not fit the norm. The camera has a good range of adjustments for stills, but when compared with my camcorder, a little less so for movies, but that's not too surprising. I prefer my camcorder's facilities for manual focussing. I've been generally very pleased with the quality of both stills and movie, in fact the movie quality rivals that of my HDV tape camcorder. I congratulate Sony on supporting SD cards, because they are so much cheaper.|#|Two things I don't like. The lens cover cannot be attached to the camera when shooting. A little clip on the side/underneath would correct this. I use the two second delay auto fire timer to overcome wobble when pressing the shoot button. Unfortunately it resets itself back to manual after each shot. Or perhaps there is a way of keeping it on and I haven't found it yet.

2.0|#|Frankly, I can't think of even one|#|Where do I start! Whether it is the camera or the software (PMB) I don't know, but the videoe is totally useless - the sound and picture breaks up throughout, the audio and picture are not synchronised - I have not been able to use even ONE piece if video. It keeps turning on features while I am filming, eg macro, panorama, landscape icons all appeared today while videoing an interview in close up, despite my not wanting these or turning these features on. The camera also stopped recording all by itself - in the middle of an interview - and it did this not once, but every time - I literally got less than a minute of footage - and none of the actual interview, just the intro. First the screen went dark, then it just turned off. The battery was not flat, and I did not touch ANYTHING to turn it off. The still shots I took with automatic were all so dark they were unusable also, and they were supposed to be on superautomatic or whatever ie exposure etc should have been automatic - so the stills are also completely unusable. These were all shot outside in sunlight, on a normal day - the same conditions I have photographed in for several years with no problems with any other camera - my last was a SONY H9, and it was a million times better than this, which is frankly fit only for the bin. I cannot understand what is wrong with this camera - it does not do any of the things it is supposed to, and the software it comes with is a sick joke. Why the video is MTS which is compatible with NOTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD is beyond me - I would never recommend to anyone to buy this camera, and I don't even have the gall to sell it to anyone, I would feel guilty for unloading such a useful instrument on even my worst enemy. SHAME sony, this camera is utter dross, and the technical support is non-existent. Unfortunately I bought it while I was in England, and am not returning there so I can't even take it back - it is the worst thing I have ever bought, and as a photojournalist in war zones who needed something small, compact, and easy to use it has proven to be the worst thing I could possibly have bought. I want my money back, because I sure got a BIG FAT LEMON.

I think the battery charging should be out of camera as opposed to plugging in the camera to a power supply. Battery life is not very long, about 3.3 hrs. if left on continuous, but does have power saving features.

It's a joy to pick up and use.|#|No instruction booklet. It really does need one if only to tell you all the things the camera does. Lens cap lanyard not designed for this camera. Manual focus could inform you better when in focus, and with less movement of the barrel, as in SLR lenses. Not enough flash control in Auto.

9.0|#|The camera is a basic DSLR in a small , compact , 'bridge' body. It possesses great features such as full ISO settings (3200) , full shutter speed adjustment (30 seconds / 4000 plus bulb) , and standard 'mechanical' , aperture setting (f2.8 - f8). Good flash , mind-blowing zoom , 1080p HD video recording , HDMI , USB AF-L , 3 inch vari-angle screen , filter effects , extensive scene modes , and in-built guide mode. Standard EVF (electronic view finder).|#|

9.0|#|Lots of features, very good picture quality. It's easy to use as a point-and-shoot, but if you need more control the options are available. The scene options, which allow you to compose different sorts of pictures (pets, action, soft focus, etc) work very well, and GPS is a nice option.|#|Not much. It's quite large and heavy, so not something you can just carry around everywhere, but that's not what it's designed for.

And the ability to add a 58mm Polarising filter, a Neutral Density filter or a UV filter to protect the main lense.

I tested it on the West Highland way (6 day walk) and it was great.|#|The only reason I didn`t give the features 10 out of 10 was because I`ve not scratched the surface of what`s available.

9.0|#|The image quality is stunning. I have moved up from the cybershot range i wanted something to push me forward. A DSLR was a step to far, this fills the gap perfectly. The build quality is amazing and it is a joy to hold, it has a weighty satisfaction when you have it in your hand. It works fine as a point and shoot camera but also as the features of a SDLR if you want to play around. It takes a little bit of playing to find all the settings in the menus, but after a short time it becomes instinctive.|#|Very little to say against it. If you hammer it for pictures then the battery can suffer, but it will still take 400+ pictures.

The size and weight is a big plus, including the 18-200mm lens.|#|With the slightly small right hand grip, I tend to hit the menu button when I am manipulating the camera, but I improve with practice.  There is a lot to learn for a relative amateur, but with trial and error and returning to the instruction manual, I continue to improve with some pleasing results.

8.0|#|Overall simplicity just set to auto for general picture taking. It also has the facilities for setting flash and some scene specific modes. Picture quality good for the class of camera. Optical zoom adequate, if you want more buy an SLR. Bought for simplicity of use, quick snaps with good results. It meets my requirements.|#|Like most small digital cameras it can be fiddly to change settings especially if you have big hands - I have. Have not yet noticed whether the battery charge fades quickly when not used, as some earlier models do, mainly because I haven't stopped using it long enough!

10.0|#|The screen is amazing quality, as is the sound considering the microphone size. You don't need a camcorder anymore! Get a decent size memory stick and it's all you need.|#|Can't charge battery from adaptor, you need to use the supplied battery charger. Fingerprints on the screen.
9.0|#|Beautifly built and very compact camera. Really easy to use especially for point-and-shoot photography. Video quality is excellent. Clear, pin-sharp touch-screen display with intuitive controls to change settings and review images.|#|Battery life is quite short so I'd definitely recommend a spare battery. Due to the compat size, the zoom range is a little limited. These are however both very minor drawbacks.

Extra features like smile detection and video recording make it  a versatile camera. also like the sliding lens cover which switches the camera on and off. Good build quality and value for money.|#|the screen gets covered in fingermarks despite tryin to hold the camera by the edges only. the touch pen prevents marks to some extent but I do seem to be constantly cleaning it.

9.0|#|The paint program is really useful with the type of work i do. I used to have the N1 camera, until i lost it on holiday, which was really good, but the T900 is far better.|#|Not really a bad point but, i work in the building industry and  found that the screen of the N1, became scratched after a while of being used.  On the T900 i placed a plastic film which has sorted this out.

Touch screen is a good feature which should make menu navigation easier.|#|The camera is very expensive (but I purchased it with an insurance claim so no harm done!).  For the money there are probably better camera's (but not this compact).

10.0|#|The camera is so easy to use and has so many great features that make the whole thing just brilliant!|#|Could do with coming with a bigger SD Card as standard.  Having the standard card gives you no storage for the 10Mg pictures that you can take with this camera and seems a little pointless especialy as the cost of cards is so low and Sony manufacture the ones for this camera...

8.0|#|Snall and neat, which is important  for me as I only have use of my left hand.  Plenty of features inc anti shake which is essential for me. But in all fairness I haven't used it a great deal yet.|#|A good make and a simple point and shoot model I thought and I am sure this is the mode that most of us use; so it was very disconcerting  to find a 54 page instruction manual slightly smaller than A5 in fairly small print. Perhaps if they'd thrown in a one day course!  I haven't read the manual yet usually having fallen asleep by page 10.

7.0|#|Good all rounder for the money.|#|The flash is really bright so overexposes some pictures, especially indoor ones.  Could do with a better zoom and I found that on close up shots it's not fab - if you are slightly too close the image is just blury.
9.0|#|Very good value.|#|filing feature which started to analyse all of my photo files going way back. A waste of time and memory. I have now deleted the files and continue to use my Finepix Software which works well and is compatible.

A wonderful buy for a not-so professional photographer.|#|Sometimes the imagary can be somewhat blurry when there is a lot of activity in the photograph taken.

5.0|#|Excellent camera in design, value and features. Shame about the picture quality|#|It just will not take good pictures. It was a replacement for a cybershot DSC-250 (Carl Ziess Lens), which almost never took a bad one. It is very frustrating.
10.0|#|Purchased this camera to replace my Fuji camera,which suddenly began taking psychedelic pictures.Very impressed by the quality of the pictures and ease of use of my new Cyber Shot|#|Have to remove the battery every time it needs charging,which is a right pain,whereas my previous camera just had to be dropped into the cradle to recharge.Other than that no problems at all.
10.0|#|easy to use|#|Cant think of any
1.0|#|When I manage to get the sttings right the pictures are good.|#|I bought this camera to replace a previous Sony Cyber Shot which I found difficult to operate.  I wanted a camera that I could just aim and snap and this one was recommended.  I cetainly can't do this and have to keep changing the settings which makes it impossible to take a quick and interesting photo of something interesting.   I realise this is because I cannot familiarise myself with the settings but it's a big disappointment for me.  I would not be able to recommend it to someone like myself.

10.0|#|Very compact.  Slips in the top pocket.  Very well sized viewing screen with excellent resolution.|#|It's not clear at the time of purchase that you have to expand the memory to achieve any number of stored pictures.  This expanded memory should be an integral part of the camera not an add on.

Screen is large and very clear. It's comfortable in the hands. Cosmetically it's a very good looking product|#|Well, a little fiddly to use, especially when hands are cold and the menu system was a bit of a faff to work out and use, but these are minor things really and don't spoil the overall use of the camera generally.

The photos were excellent that we took, it is a small product and easy to carry around either in a bag or pocket.|#|Not so much a bad point but it was not clear when it was bought that it did not include a memory stick and seeing as it was bought as a christmas present we had to wait a few days before we could get one. it would be much easier if it was included at the time of purchase.

10.0|#|Excellent design and easy to use!|#|I do not like the flash of this camera. Even if I put the camera in automatic flash mode the image comes too bright and ruins the picture. Sometimes it is difficult to remember to switch off completely the flash. The automatic mode should adjust to the environment but that does not happen. A smarter flash function please.

8.0|#||#|I am disabled, with the use of one hand only, resulting with some inevitable awkwardness. This is not a criticism since I love the camera and its overall design is great. I just have a vision of a feature rich device such as this being supported by voice recognition and a voice command interface taking the place of your screen-based multi-mode button and switch system for people like myself and as I do with my laptops.An interesting target that is techically remakably closely within reach would be to design a camera which would be usable and useful to a blind person.

10.0|#|I'm very impressed with this camera so far.  I love my Sony DSLR, but I really wanted something simple to keep around me so that when a special moment pops up I can quickly snap it and not have it look awful.  The HX7V does exactly that for me.  I was able to take pictures of my pets to a professional quality without even having to think about it or even really play with any settings.  And the LCD screen is so vibrant and much better than my DSLR.  It is also extremely quiet and very fast.  I'll be testing it out at a concert next month and I'm hoping what people said about the HX5V remains true for this model.  All in all a great buy!|#|A bit heavier than I would have expected and not a lot of room to hold the camera without getting fingerprints on the screen.
7.0|#|- the intelligent auto settings to take photos is very very good|#|- the record button is too close to where you hold the camera with my thumb, so I repeatedly accidentally pressed record and made a video unintentionally. If it was made a slide switch rather than a button for record this could be avoided.
9.0|#|Takes the picture really quickly, which is helpful when you are taking pictures of a 2 year old! The screen is very clear and the settings make any situation photogenic even for amatuers.|#|

8.0|#|very good picture quality, compact with lots of featurs, especially the movie feature but not too much opportunity to use some of them yet|#|with little experience yet it seemd that soe of the features, scene settings, white light etc are a little difficult to achieve before the shot hs disappeared !!
8.0|#|The picture resolution is astonishing and the features are great.  I particularly like the one that takes three exposures and produces a composite image where all areas are correctly lit - and the panoramic pictures are good fun, even if I'm not sure what to do with them now that I've taken them.  It is small, easy to use, has a large screen and communicates very happily with my Vaio laptop.|#|The only slight disadvantage is that it is slightly bigger than the phone I used to take pictures with and I am wary of carrying it in my pocket.  I bought a case for it which is bigger than it needs to be and so I don't always have the camera with me when I want it.  It's not the camera's fault.  I just need to find the right case.
9.0|#|Feels a nice solid piece of equipment. Good size for pocket or bag. Great image on rear screen  to focus in most conditions..I use a 16gig card and it responds quickly allowing me to take pictures in quick succession the panorama feature is very good. as is the switch between video and still pictures. Good battery life also. .  Like the gps feature  The 3d feature is a bit of a novelty although I havent been able to properly see my photos in 3d yet!|#|This camera pretty much does everything manually or automatically. the menu controls are quite complex as you may feel befits a clever  camera , but after a while you realise which settings you use most. The camera doesnt come with a memory card or an hdmi cable which is a bit mean .
9.0|#|Image quality very good. Zoom good, with no appreciable shake on full zoom. Easy to set up and menus are intuative. PMB computer software good.|#|Froze twice within first week, OK since then (2 months). Had to disconnect battery to restart.

9.0|#|Great quality photos and videos, fits in my pocket,easy to use,fab little camera|#|Took me AGES to work out how to take videos off the camera and on to my laptop, much prefered it when all images/videos were visible through 'my computer'.

8.0|#|Small and light-weight. Wonderful wide-angle lense with remarkable telephoto. Very crisp pictures.|#|In trying to offer so much, it became rather too complicated to use effectively.
9.0|#|The camera has a host of manual options and even the pre-set are pretty good. I have no problems using it, the controls are intuitive and well placed|#|The GPS drains the battery quite quickly and the use of yet another type of USB connection which requires a special lead
10.0|#|brilliant camera overall|#|play button is too fiddley, cant get GPS to work, some image blur on telephoto end.
10.0|#|3D, panoramic settings, HD Video|#|Battery power doesn't last long between charges, HD Video cannot be copied to DVD or CD disc because I bought the camera in USA.  Also have tried to contact Sony in regard to solving this problem and have had absolutely no luck whatsoever.  It's taken the shine off my camera.  When I bought the camera at the beginning I couldn't put it down I was so enamoured with it.  Now I feel deflated because of the after sales help and advice.  Very disappointing.

10.0|#|has lots of features which I am still getting to know. I considered the digital SLR type cameras as i had an SLR years ago, but wanted the convenience of size and being able to carry camera in handbag, - this camera gives me a lot of the options i would have had with SLR without the extra size. I have had Sony cybershot for years so only looked at Sony for replacement. good that you now do not have to use just Sony memory cards. been really pleased with results so far.|#|I have caught the video record button by mistake a couple of times, and I find that this button does not feel as positive as on my old camera. It also seems to take longer for the recording to actually start than on my old camera

8.0|#|Easy to use and well built.  Make sure you get a big memory card - Play.com have the best value ones.|#|Movie record button in the corner, means that you sometimes press this by accident.  A bit fiddly to hold, but you get used to it.
10.0|#|Very easy to use for a camera with so many advanced functions. Superb pictures every time. Very easy to connect and view content on HDMI TV.|#|Disappointed with sound in video mode.

9.0|#|Love the panorama function, the burst settings, almost unbelievable zoom for a compact, very good film quality and the 3D capability. Also the auto and intelligent functions. Scroll wheel is very good.|#|Sometimes difficulties recognising faces, often difficulties recognising when people are blinking or smiling. Have also seen a friend's similarly priced compact camera which has all similar functions but with a couple of extra functions that enable them to change the colour of an object in the photo so that it comes out differently to reality when taken and also to recognise an object, distinguish it from the background and keep its colour as well as all the settings applied to the object but make the background grey. I think this would be a great feature to have on this - already great - camera, especially so as to compete with ones such as my friend's, which are similarly priced.
9.0|#|Solidly built camera that packs a lot of technology into a *relatively* compact body. Very comprehensive range of shooting modes including some great options for capturing high dynamic range shots and low light scenes without flash. Large ISO range. Beautiful clarity to shots. Able to continuously shoot for 1 second, capturing 10 shots. Limited experiments with HD recording have yielded good results. Excellent image stabilisation.|#|GPS seems reluctant to acquire a lock. Documentation doesn't come even close to adequate so a lot of experimenting is required before putting the camera to its best use. Background defocus seems incredibly sensitive to distance from lens and doesn't - as I'd expected - work by adjusting the aperture but by taking two sequential shots with different focus (results when it works are lovely).
10.0|#|Excellent all round camera|#|None
9.0|#|Great camera, easy to use. Easily slips into your pocket for taking those imprmptu shots when walking my dog in the countryside. I find this camer much more convenient than carrying a heavy SLR around. Also I like the fact that I can view photos taken, direct from the memory card on my 50inch TV.|#|With this in mind, I'm not to happy with the battery closure, wheather this was changed for technical reasons Im ot sure?

It has a Zeiss T* Vario-Sonnar 5x zoom lens 14.3-71.5mm (35mm equivalent is 24-120mm), probably the best lens for any camera including DSLRs. It uses either Sony's Memory Stick Pro or Compact Flash Type1 or Type2 or Microdrive cards... talk about versatile! The LCD screen hinges and rotates, I love using it as a waist level viewfinder similar to the finder on a Bronica or Hasselblad.|#|My only complaint with the Sony DSC-R1is that it doesn't have the 'NightShot' mode that other Sony DSC cameras had, i.e., the DSC-F828.

9.0|#|Excellent lens and sensor.  Good intuitive controls.  Good build quality and ergonomics.  The hinged screen allows you to take a photo from any angle without having to crane to see through the viewfinder - excellent for self portraits, if you're into that sort of thing, and taking pictures while using a beanbag for support.  No chance of getting dust on the sensor, and no messing about changing lenses.  Good wide angle to reasonable telephoto zoom range.  2 memory slots (in different formats though).|#|Very slow when using RAW, and unreasonably large RAW file size.  RAW software isn't brilliant - I use Bibble now.  Accessory lenses very expensive.  Auto focus is slow and not nearly as good as a DSLR, especially in low light.  Although night performance is good, the viewfinder goes very dark, if you're into very long exposures in near darkness, having no optical viewfinder will drive you potty.  In essence, if any of the above is a show stopper for you, don't even think about buying this camera, if they don't bother you much, it's a wonderful picture taking machine!

1.0|#|Reasonably quick response when switched on and quick focusing .|#|As a still camera ( as opposed to an SLR) Should a twig come between you and the subject you get good pictures of twigs with a blurred subject behind , the focusing square(s) help in this respect .
9.0|#|Produces very sharp, well saturated images almost every single time. The LCD is very nice, although I tend to use the viewfinder more (to save battery power). The feel of the camera is great, the grip is very ergonomically designed and fits well in your hand. The photos, when uploaded and viewed even at 100% look rich and have good detail. Battery life is good and takes AA batteries, which is always a good thing. Takes incredibly good quality video with good audio. The overall picture quality is superb. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.|#|Flash recycle time can be painfully slow at times. Night shots and shots of low lighting can look grainy especially at higher ISO levels. The flash is very powerful and can often wash out faces at low light conditions.

10.0|#|I like the compactness of it. It has one of the most powerful flashguns built-in that I have ever experienced in a digital compact.The 12x zoom is just brilliant. It handles like a beauty and I love the 3 inch screen. The video clip function works well. Again picture quality is excellent. One point to remember, if at times you find the picture is not clear or detailed, then 90% of the time it is 'user' error.|#|The lens cap does not fit very firmly on the lens, however, the lens cap attachment which is fixed to the camera prevents it falling off and getting lost. But this should not detract from using this camera. You cannot put the camera in your shirt pocket, but what the heck!

8.0|#|this camera is a great all rounder. I immediately took this on holiday and found myself breathless with its capabilities. Multi shot was a great a great feature; distant landscape shots. brilliant auto focus.|#|There are important features to learn in order to achieve great shots. Choosing the right flash setting and type of shutter speed can be fiddily.

1.0|#|Reasonably quick response when switched on and quick focusing .|#|As a still camera ( as opposed to an SLR) Should a twig come between you and the subject you get good pictures of twigs with a blurred subject behind , the focusing square(s) help in this respect .

9.0|#|Looks fab, image quality is great for the price, its features are user friendly and some are cool like the panoramic sweep.|#|It feels a bit plastic, looks like it would smash into a million pieces if it got dropped.

8.0|#|Although I have only had limited time to practice with it I have found most applications easy to access and use. I am not a professional by any means so I bought an idiots ( that's me) guide to use and I am trying out shots I never attempted before with some success.

9.0|#|Very clear pictures for all occasions, quick and simple to use. The Batteries supplied will last for long time (At least 100 pictures!) which is ideal for days out. Great zoom lense on the 6, 3 and 2 megapixel settings. Also there are plenty of automatic settings to choose from.. Twilight, panoramic, high speed shutter and also one which brings out the blue when taking pictures of the ocean.|#|Some of the more advanced options are not explained well enough in the manual. Also when the camera is set to VGA mode and set at maximum zoom (52x) the picture quality is greatly reduced.

9.0|#|viewfinder; lots of settings; options for auto or manual adjustment in most of the settings; sports setting very useful with ever moving kids;|#|the lens doesn't tilt like my previous cybeshot did wich restricts some of the angles you can take a photo in.

Lots of features and options to play with and takes a good picture.  Lightweight and perfect size.|#|Bit slow to take pictures at night - sometimes feels like 1.5 secs between clicking and image being taken, depending on what mode you're in.  Also, it feels a bit flimsy and fragile - not very sturdy.  It doesn't come with a little case or sleeve to keep it in - cheapskates that Sony are.

8.0|#|I already own one of these (W35) but it's packed up so was looking for another, now hard to find, the camera dealer had this in the back. So good points are:- compact, easy to use, Carl Zeiss lens (which is a must to get the really fabulous picture quality of this camera), this version has a bigger screen compared to my original, and the joint  most important feature for me, along with the Carl Zeiss lens, is the view finder. Saves battery power and when outside no problems trying to see the screen in bright sunlight.|#|Not such a quality feel as the W35 feels a little plastic. Not as easy as the W35, more complicated, too many features, this is a point and shoot surely?(the Carl Zeiss lens does all the hard work for you) as usual the manufacturer always changes things, supposedly for the best, the systems in the software are different to the W35 (at least for me anyway, I'm not a techy so learning new ways when I'd been using the W35 for years has thrown me) Unfortunately the sensor gave up within two days of use so it's back with Sony under warranty but the few photots I got while it was working were as good as my original, which again I say is all due to the Carl Zeiss lens.

9.0|#|Large screen. Burst mode allows a decent number of pictures to be taken to capture the best one  - good when photographing kids, moving subjects and animals. Feels well made. Light and compact to carry. Picture quality is good. Very user friendly.|#|I don't like the fact that the battery has to come out to charge the camera - would rather be able to plug a charger cable straight into camera. Perhaps a minor inconvenience though as the camera is very good. I thought the W55 I bought previously coped better with very bright sunshine if I forgot to put filters (purchased separately) on.

10.0|#|Just what I wanted - compact but with good image quality and easy to use.  I thought the touch screen was a bit of a gimmick - but it actually makes it much quicker to find your way around rather than trawling through menus.  The function with which you can set up your own setting (ISO, focus position, meter reading position and brightness) is really helpful - particularly as it saves your own settings for next time you use the camera.  Incredible value for money.|#|I can't rate all the features - I haven't made much use of many of them.  The smile one is pretty good - but a bit time consuming to set up.  The image quality could be better - but for the price it is better than expected!
9.0|#|Looks great and has good features, i was suprised how well the smile setting worked, a good fun camera.|#|As its a touch screen it gets a bit grubby with fingerprints, advanced settings are a bit confusing.

The smile shutter feature is hilarious once it gets going - its not always as quick as i'd like it- despite putting on the high sensitivity on it, but once its starts, you're laughing your head off.|#|When capturing fast moving images, there is no flash option which can limit the fast pics you can take.

I have just taken it on holiday to Thailand and the pictures that i took with it were amazing.|#|Shame the Hi Def cable for hooking it up to your TV dosent come included in the box. Switching between still photos and movie mode takes a bit longer than normal digital cameras but you soon get use to it
10.0|#|touch screen display, which is so easy to use ...and within the menu is a face detection setting, smile shutter and so much more. All this and the Sony T70 Digital Camera is an incredible 8.1 megapixel, so picture quality speaks for it's self. Value for money, I would say, this for a point and shoot camera is a must to have. Recommend this to anyone.|#|If I had to say anything bad about the T70, this would probabley relate to all cameras ...and that is a shorter charge longer lasting battery. That's it.

Photographic options to suit every occasion, or automatic mode which copes well almost all of the time. Face detection focus option is almost uncanny in its accuracy. Light weight and easy to use with option of eye level viewfinder to eliminate problems with LCD screen display in very bright light - LCD screen excellent in general use.|#|Lightness of controls has gone a little too far - too easy to change zoom and/or programme settings unintentionally during use - giving rise to a perception that build-quality is not quite top notch. Similarly the lightness of the camera (a good thing for me) can give the perception of a 'plasticky' or 'cheap' product e.g. compared with my (oh-so-slow) Olympus mju with its (relatively heavy) stainless-steel case. The effort to provide multiple options has also gone a bit over the top - with duplication of option menus ending up giving more confusion than necessary.

9.0|#|We're all different, but I find it suits my needs admirably. I think Sony have achieved a high level of  both form and function with this design. Maybe I've paid for the brand, but I have a Sony computer and that's been great, too!|#|Menu is a tad confusing to negotiate, but I haven't really had time to study the user instructions, or experiment, so that's really my personal issue!

10.0|#|Fab little camera very easy to use with a nice big screen to view pictures.|#|
10.0|#|Sony always make good quality products.  I love the size of this camera.  Perfect handbag size. I like the idea you can buy it in different colours.  The camera I bought was white not blue. I like the automatic features.  Good idea for people who are not photographers, can't go wrong.|#|
9.0|#|EASY TO USE GOOD QUALITY|#|NONE
9.0|#|I think it is the best occasional use bridge camera on the market at the moment.|#|None for me, but have heard the white balance is not as adjustable as serious users would like. Personally, I wouldn't know where to start...
9.0|#|Features such as face detection really work well, and the images are clear and well defined.|#|The large LCD screen which is a good point also has a disadvantage that you can't help touching the screen which leaves marks, and are not that easy to clean.

8.0|#|Great design, very little in the way of shutter lag and good set of specs.|#|Menu system is more complicated than it could have been.
10.0|#|I LOVE IT.|#|Without a memory card it only holds 3 photos so you must get a card.
9.0|#|I have long experience of using Sony Cyber-shot cameras and have found them excellent. Picture quality is very good overall, especially compared to other cameras in a similar range. The battery is compatible with my other Sony (SLR-Digital) camera. A large screen, which is fairly clear even in bright sunlight, but also has a separate viewfinder that I prefer to use. The final image is larger then the area contained in the viewfinder.|#|No direct electrical feed to camera. Batteries are rechargeable only in a separate charger.
9.0|#|the image quality is pretty awesome, it's got a big screen, and you can store up to 8 songs on it to play in a slideshow... does pretty much everything|#|you can't zoom in when recording a video...
9.0|#|You can set it on auto and just point and shoot.  Fast to turn on and off.  Viewfinder handy for shooting in really bright light or you can change to a brighter lcd display if you need to.  Easy to see instantly how much battery you have left and how many photos you can still take. I bought a LowePro leather case which fits it snugly and protects it well.|#|Not found any yet.
9.0|#|5x zoom. Wide angle useful for photos of buildings, much closer than normal. Viewfinder makes fast shooting easier in bright light. Also firmer hold. Stabiliser allowed good images in churches without flash. Good night shots when on tripod.|#|Against light auto flash did not often fire leaving subjects too dark, really needed forced flash. Shutter button very small, 1st stage very light. Viewfinder only covers approx 80% of view leaving subject with more surrounding space than intended.
9.0|#|I have only used the camera for a couple of weeks and found it very good to use. The screen image quality is excellent but I have not as yet assessed the printed quality, although I expect that it will be equally good. I like the viewfinder option as using any screen viewing can be difficult in bright light, although I find this much better than my previous camera.|#|I have not quite become adept at speedy aadjustment of settings when using the camera, but this may be more of a reflection on the limited time spent in reviewing the accompanying manual and becoming really familiar with the settings menu.
9.0|#|Very simple to use with the automatic focus, flash etc but also has plenty of other features to really enhance the picture quality. Superb to use with an HD TV such as Sony Bravia and has a great slideshow function with music.|#|Doesn't come with any standard accesories such as HD cable or protective case or memory card.
3.0|#|There is no point talking about good points when the image quality is so poor- cameras are for taking pictures, Sony seems to have forgotten that ( this is the second sony camera I have given up on this year)|#|Don't be fooled by the camera screen pictures- enlarge one to A4 and weep.
9.0|#|A compact camera, excellent value and easy to use.  Really pleased.|#|It's gives blurred images when using on action photos i.e. childrens slides or people moving quickly.
10.0|#|I've only given it an 8/10 for ease of use as I'm still learning with it.  Great camera, great photos.  Perfect|#|
9.0|#||#|Need to purchase a decent size memory card, suggest that you purchase with camera as you only have a very small inbuilt memory with the camera.
9.0|#|good quality.. great pictures very happy with the purchase|#|Sony have awkward dial, but realitively easy to use
9.0|#|28mm Wide angle lens. Also great for poor light conditions where no flash is to be used(ie inside museums,churches,etc. Can trim photos and add effects.Solid build.|#|Accessing some parts of the menu, but that comes with pratice. No manual system.
10.0|#|Probably the best camera I have ever bought - very straightforward to use and excellent picture results|#|None
9.0|#|Good to have an optical viewfinder for sunny conditions when it is impossible to see image on screen.|#|would have liked option of printing date on pictures.
10.0|#|Its a great little compact camera.  Stylish and plenty of fancy features for your average person who snaps away.  I cant comment on too many technical details as the world of technology baffles me somewhat but I do have a sound head on my shoulders and I looke to hunt a bargain and this camera fits the gap!  I particularly like the way the camera detects someone smiling so no more photos of people with their eyes shut trying to catch that smile.  Lots of good effects on the camera and can take multiple photos (not sure of techinical term) so you are able to catch the shots you usually miss.  I take photos of my ducks stretching their wings mid flight and it catches them perfect!|#|Nothing bad to report.  As I say i'm your average person buying a camera to get some cool photos of my family and the like and this camera does all of that and has more functions than I will probably ever use.
10.0|#|HD, Ecellent picture quality and easy to use|#|No zoom on video feature - shame
8.0|#|Even though there are lots of dials and formats you can use it is easy to use..and takes great shots.|#|Not much memory on camera....and the fact that you have to buy a memory card and case for this camera is a down side for what you pay you should be provided with these as a basic...

I use the fold-out screen more often than I would have expected to and the live view is very responsive.|#|The autofocus system can sometimes get confused and doesn't always choose the right point.

9.0|#|Its shape is easy to handle whether your hand is large or small and it is not too heavy. It's easy to change according to the type of shot you wish to make. Even for a beginner, it is easy to use successfully. Picture quality is good too.|#|It doesn't have the capacity to zoom in very close and needs a different lens to do so which can be very fiddly if you are trying to capture something likely to disappear at any moment.

8.0|#|My Minolta AF lenses, 25 years old and bought for my Minolta Dynax camera, operate perfectly on the Sony and produce excellent quality pictures.|#|Also, the quality of the image from the standard lens is merely average, especially at the edges at both ends of the zoom range, and certainly pales in comparison with those from the Minolta lenses I have.
10.0|#||#|havn't found any yet, i'm very happy with it. one thing before i bought it was the alpha logo on the front i didn't like, i thought it cheapend the look of the camera, i'm glad it didn't put me of too much, it is a great camera
3.0|#|Nice quality|#|Menu system is far too complicated
8.0|#|Images are really clear and there are lots of different settings for different scenes/effects. The camera is really light to carry and small enough to take to locations to shoot without weighing you down or needing a massive bag to put it in. The shutter speed is brilliant for action shots.|#|Some of the little images on the buttons for each setting arent very clear so it takes a while to work out what each one does.
10.0|#|Great pictures,  able to use Minolta lenses ,easy to use ,don't need to buy expensive brands to take very good pictures.|#|Menu access,  wireless remote not build in,
9.0|#|Excellent choice as a first digital SLR - controls are easy to find and operate. I really appreciate the swivel screen when using the live view option. Autofocus is fast and reliable. Feels very solid but is easy to handle. If you have the time it's well worth checking out what this camera will do - I've hardly begun yet. Images are excellent, even when blown up.|#|Shutter can be a little noisy in a quiet environment, otherwise none that I've come across yet.
10.0|#|Having upgraded from a Panasonic Lumix compact to this my first DSLR I found it amazing, easy to use and picture quality quite outstanding. I have since bought a 200 and 300mm lens and the quality remains. I have taken over 10,000 photos with the camera and use it often. Still learning to tweak my shots but the camera is excellent.|#|I really cannot  think of any bad points however I'm sure that there will be a few the longer I have and use it.
10.0|#|The kit lens with this camera are also extremely good, which is not always the case with other brands.|#|None that I have discovered so far. The battery compartment door could have been a bit sturdier, hence the rating of 9.
10.0|#|Easy to use, value for money. Very intuitive professional camera|#|
10.0|#|Adjustable viewing screen with no shutter delay when composing photo's using this method. Optical steady shot built into the camera not the lens. Easy menu system.|#|None so far
10.0|#|User friendly, great for learning camera for a novice into DSLR like me, good size.|#|High speed shooting is a bit too slow, GPS tagging from the GPS-CS3 to a ARAW file used by the camera does not really work.  PMB supplied software is poor.
10.0|#|Like the automatic settings on the camera very much, and the images are superb. Like the fact that it has Minolta fitting for the lenses as can get a good selection of lenses.|#|The flash is not the best, but is adequate.
10.0|#|For someone who doesn't have a great knoledge of photography, but does wish to have a camera which produces suchh good results, its a brilliant piece of kit. The back up from sony is 1st class with regard to tuition with regular tutorialsover the internet once the product is registered. the more you get to know about the camera the better the results, just love it - I'll never go back to poit and shoot.|#|That the camera does not come with a case.....
10.0|#|I have nothing bad to say. Excellent quality and still very highly rated by press. 5* product for the cost. very easy to use and excellent quality pictures|#|Nothing at all.
9.0|#|)|#|Nothing much wrong with the camera at all. Some of the settings could be a bit confusing if you were a beginner.
10.0|#|Long battery life|#|Quite heavy
10.0|#|Generally, well designed traditional body; good balance and readily accessible controls. The vertical control grip is a good addition to the balance of the body.|#|Just a minor point, but the finger gap between the handgrip and the lens flange is relatively narrow
10.0|#|Great value for money|#|Slight slowdown when take a series of photos quickly
8.0|#|Easy operation and lens change. Still learning!|#|No complaints. Interesting occurrence recently. Proximity of new US warship caused all DSLR's to fail as if battery dead. Assume electronic interference from vessel's technology - incidental of course.
8.0|#|tilting screen, image quality, image size|#|
8.0|#|Well built and easy to use. The tiltable screen makes taking shots at difficult angles easier. Built in flash is adequate for most needs.|#|Does not charge whilst connected to USB port.
10.0|#|Super steady shoot and live view are both excellent. With Super steady shot it is possible to get some pretty good shots using a long lens. I like the adjustable LCD screen. My previous camera, Konica Minolta A200, had an even more versatile screen but this one is good and useful for high and low shots.|#|Noise when shooting with high ISO. Auto focusing in low light with long lens, however, presumably that is the lens rather than the camera.
8.0|#|Price, choice of image settings, good software came with it, easy to get used to yet a lot more you can learn. Great chice of lenses and extras. Always seems to be an upgrade to save up for.|#|in the build, not as sharp as some images I've seen from Nikon and Cannon, but still very good.
8.0|#|Many features. Interchangable with my Minolta lenses. Moved upto a350 from a100 effortlessly.|#|Lack of adequate protection for viewing screen.
10.0|#|The weight and balance of the a350 is perfect for me.  The tilting LCD display screen is also excellent especially for me with back problems.  The anti shake system seems to work well and the easy read menu is superb.|#|Not really a bad point rather a comment.  I would have liked the a350 to come with an LCD cover so all lense/screen aspects of the camera are protected from day one.

9.0|#|This is my first SLR and the main reasons for buying this camera was the price. The two lenses that come with it are brilliant and if I had to buy either of these seperately, it would have pushed the price up considerably.|#|There aren't any bad points really. You get what you pay for. If I was really picky,  I'd say I want even better quality pictures but I have been comparing my photos to proffessional photos and I know I need a lot more experience and I'm looking at serious money for that type of equipment but this is a great starter pack to learn digital SLR photography with ease..
10.0|#|shoot or manual|#|none
8.0|#|Good features, tiltable screen very useful. feels good and comfortable when handling. Read lots of reviews of cameras in the price bracket and felt the Sony offered good value for money. Bought the camera about a year ago now and have been extremely pleased with my purchase. Have since bought my son the updated model,ie the 330, from the same retailer, he loves the the camera and insists upon showing me all his results!!|#|So few to speak of, maybe some of the buttons are a little bit fiddly but this does not detract from the overall operation. As mentioned above the newer 330 is now the one to look for as mine is no longer available, however similar comments still apply to this camera.
10.0|#|Greece with it, and  have been very impressed by the quality of the photos I have taken with this camera. It travels very well. It is easy to learn the menu, and set up, if you should so wish, during picture taking. Exceedingly fast focus, crisp and quick live view. Nice ergonomic feel to the whole camera and a reassuring weight, not too light and plasticky like some I could mention. Altogether a super allround camera, for those who like to point and shoot and then some............|#|No grid screen like others on the viewfinder or live view. Being really picky, but to encourage use of live view for more people a shade could come as part of the kit for the screen
9.0|#|all good except lcd screen|#|the lcd screen not what you get on the photo, photo a lot better.
9.0|#|Very easy to use with clear instuctions. Photo reproduction is brilliant even for an amateur like me|#|Haven't found any yet
9.0|#|Easy to use straight from the box. Lots to learn though.|#|Haven't come across any so far.
9.0|#|The picture quality is very good. It has a large viewing screen and there are numerous features, not normally available on such a small camera, which will be fantastic when I am used to using it.|#|Having only used the camera a few times, I am having trouble finding the various features when I am trying to take a picture quickly. This will become easier with use of course, but is frustrating at the moment. Another point is that when I am using the camera outside in bright sunlight, it is not easy to view the image I am taking on the screen. A viewfinder would be useful in these conditions.
8.0|#|THE LARGE SCREEN IS GREAT TO NOT ONLY TO VIEW THE PICTURE YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE BUT ALSO FOR WATCHING VIDEO PLAYBACKS. THE TOUCH SCREEN IS GREAT TO USE BUT IT LEAVES LOTS OF FINGER PRINTS! A WHOLE HOST OF FEATURES TO PLAY AROUND WITH|#|THE ONLY POOR FEATURE I CAN THINK OF IS THE SLIDING OF THE LENS COVER.ITS A BIT CUMBERSOME TO SLIDE OPEN WITH ONLY A THIN PIECE OF METAL TO PUSH. WITH ALL ITS TECHNOLOGY YOU WOULD THINK SONY WOULD MAKE IT AUTOMATIC OPENING AND CLOSING.
9.0|#|The wide screen gives lots of room to view pictures, face recognition is very clever and works well in a crowded pub!! The independent focusing boxes also work well allowing you to just press and know the subject will be in focus. The camera is very light but does not feel flimsy. A very good product I'm extremely pleased with.|#|peoples faces do look a strange colour on the screen but look fine when transferred to a computer which can lead to deleted pictures that were probably quite good. The only other thing is there is not really a good way to hold the camera and it is quite easy to get ends of fingers on your pics if you have large hands, not enough to make me dislike it but annoying until you learn to stop doing it
8.0|#|Features, especially playback options, Display screen, the best I've come across. Light weight but feels solid. Low light capabilities outstanding. Point and press features excellent.|#|Only one, but quite serious. It is extremely difficult to understand menu and arrive at the feature you need. I usually get there eventually but always purely by luck and I have no idea what I pressed or touched to get to wherever I need to get to!
10.0|#|Excellent large touch screen, smile and face detection, excellent in built video recorder and fantastic picture quality. Bulid quality is top-notch.|#|None!
9.0|#|Very visual camera......  looks the part|#|Really needs a screen protector as standard.
1.0|#|The camera is very nice and sleek|#|but only for the few months that it worked properly.  Then it started vibrating on switching it on and became useless. In fact we had to buy another camera as we did not find any support from Sony despite the issue being known for this and similar models.  My wife is particularly disappointed as she loved the camera initially.
10.0|#|ABsolutely amazing pictures and videos, my best ever camera. Wouldn't change for anything.|#|The menu is a bit complicated, but you only have to get used to it. Once you figure everything out, and you find the best settings, the camera is perfect.

9.0|#|Looks good, beautifully built and packed with really cool features.  I love the 5x zoom!|#|The lens is very close to the edge so you have to be careful not to get the edge of your finger in shot.

Ease of use is paramount for me as I mainly only take photos on our our annual 2-week (+/-) summer holiday. (I took a short course on how to develop my use of the more advanced features - e.g. close-up) but as half the course participants had much more expensive and bulkier digital cameras, I decided to opt for the default setting as I could see very little visible benefit in doing anything more complicated.|#|The handbook could be more detailed and beginner-friendly - a glossary of technical terms would be helpful, The tutor on the course I attended couldn't find a lot of what he was looking for in the handbook.

9.0|#|Battery lasts ages, which is a real boon. You can leave it for 2-3 months and it will still work when you come back to it. It's light, but solid (won't break easily) and the photos are good quality. Viewing window is more than adequate and well lit and doesn't drain the battery. Overall a great camera|#|Could do with a few more settings for image resolution- the ones on there are ok, but I like a bit more flexibility with them. What's with the lead that comes with this camera though - it's huge and very annoying. I realise that Sony probably wanted to cut costs and put a lead in that can connect with the TV and the PC, but this is excessively large (I really wish Sony had stuck with the mini-USB connection...)

Sony want £117.00 just to look at it! My wife claims that she paid £200.00+ for it but shops say a similar replacement will cost £80-100. I will not buy another Sony product. My 10 year old Fuji Fine Pix F401 Compact is still working like new. Unfortunately its a bit slow and lacking capacity compared with modern cameras. Next buy will be another Fuji or a Panasonic.

An excellent straightforward camera for most people. I would certainly buy this model - or rather, whatever is its equivalent in a couple of years time. Perfect size to take around virtually all the time. Data transfer with Memory Stick is so easy - providing one's computer has the right slot.

It is smaller than on my previous Sony the DSC P200 and I have to use an adaptor to make it fit, which is a nuisance - I wouldn't have bought it if i'd known!  Also, I was able to charge the battery with a lead that went directly to the camera with the P200 - with this one I have to take the battery out of the camera and put it in a special charger which again, is less convenient.

Though if you look at the picture at normal viewing this does not show.

Point and click which gets the job done.  A great little camera.  The TV playback with slide show features is really cool and the music playback is also a great touch.|#|Sometimes the picture quality can be not as good as you wanted. An odd angle may cause the picture to be blurry or dim.  Also had to buy a seperate memory card, at this day and age a few Gig of inbuilt memory can't be too much to ask for.

8.0|#|Great photos, a quick start up time to take pictures also like the intelligent auto function which decides your setting you are in very well. 10x zoom and face detection accurate.Brought this to upgrade my old olympus camera and the print quality of the 10mp is great. Smile detection it also agood feature if you want to make sure you get a perfect pose. There is manual scence detection also with manual adjustments via on screen menu|#|Need to take off lense cap before turning camera on, it will not let you use it even you take it off afterwards, needs to be restarted which can be abit annoying if you need the camera quickly. once you get used to it its not a problem. Watch out for flash popping up unexpectily when in auto modes.

Make sure you get fast (Mark 2) cards - a slow card gives you a warning that the camera may not be able to store or retrieve your pictures.  Correspondence with the manufacturer on this was useless - they gave a totally spurious explanation which made me even more worried, but when I switched to a faster card the warning vanished.

10.0|#|I haven't found anything bad about this camera yet. I trawled the internet for days to get the best and affordable upgrade from my old Nikon L11, which was built with extremely flimsy plastic, the battery lid catch broke a few days after I bought it. I had to use silver duck tape to keep it closed while taking pictures! My new Sony DSC-H20 camera is very sturdy in build, with very powerful features and in camera re-touching or editing. The picture quality is brilliant which surprised me. It also has HD video recording  which is going to come in very handy for my Niece's wedding in July. I also put in a Sony 8GB memory stick which gives me a couple of hours video recording. I just can't go wrong with this camera for the price  it's a bargain. I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants an affordable digital camera that is only slightly bigger than a compact camera. I love it and I'm going to have this camera for some years to come.|#|I haven't found any yet.
10.0|#|The pictures have a really good quality. What I really like about my camera is that it can catch the smallest details.|#|Bad point is that there is no option like taking pictures in black and white. But if we would ignore this bit, it has more awesome features.

The slideshow function with background function is also very good.|#|closing automatically when the camera is switched unfortunately with this model the cover has to be manually removed but I'll get used to that. The only other thing is the noise when using the video zoom, however that can be overcome if you plan to put your own music over the video.

9.0|#|It is easy to use as a beginner and very simple to access the library of images.  It is lightweight and easily portable.|#|The battery does not last long if you leave it in the camera.  A backup battery is excessively priced compared to the cost of the camera itself.  it is not easy to learn to use the sophisticated features.

3.0|#|Great picture result when outdoor|#|No Date and Time stamp on still images and video recording. This is a basic feature which I expected from a top of the line digital camera. Now I don't know when the picture was taken and have to name file and folder as dates. What a pain. Extremely disappointed by this. If I had known before, I would not have bought this camera.

9.0|#|HDTV and cannot fault the quality, the size of the unit allows you to put it in your shorts pocket and roam around, we bought it with the children in mind and to capture those video moments without the need of a second hd camcorder, it is a great allround product and you will never need a camcorder again|#|the only down side is for still images we do get some blurring on moving shots, i think this maybe a technical problem with the camera and are returning to get fixed

10.0|#|This is the second Sony Cybershot camera and I would carry on buying more sony cameras as they are easy to use and have brilliant picture quality|#|None really, multi shot is good but does not use the flash but this is normal for cameras
8.0|#|Small and light and fits easily in a pocket or a handbag, so it goes with me ecerywhere. It is very easy to operate and comes with a good manual.|#|Finally, I would have been happier if the camera had come with a memory stick. and a little pouch.

10.0|#|I was a bit jubious at first as this was an insurance replacement, but having used the camera on several occasions I can safely say that it is a lot better than my previous one, much easier to use and better picture quality, plus more features that my old one did not have, I am very pleased with this model.|#|
9.0|#|I love being able to suss out how to, for example, turn off the flash by just playing with the camera.  Its great for snaps at concerts.  And I love the touch screen feature.|#|would like more zoom capability
8.0|#|Good Photos|#|
7.0|#|Sleek, smart, easy to use|#|Washed out photos, easy to switch on by accident and drain the battery.
8.0|#|It is a point and shoot camera and does everything for you|#|It is probably down to me not spending enough time working out the features, but seeing as it is supposed to do everything I took it to my birthday party and all the pics were dark and blurred.  It was probably me using it wrong?
10.0|#|image quality.|#|None.
10.0|#|I'm really pleased with the picture quality on this camera.  The touch screen takes a bit of getting used to but means that all of the back of the camera is screen rather than having buttons or dials on there.  The 'smile detector' is great fun!  You can also use the zoom function while taking video footage which I've never had on a camera before and I think its a great feature.|#|I found that because the camera is so small, it can be quite fiddly to open and close the cover and I'm also scared of dropping it!!  I put the camera in a pocket with a pair of glasses and the casing scratched quite easily, my fault for putting both things in together but if you're going to buy one of these cameras, make sure you don't make the same mistake!

10.0|#|picture quality is so good that everybody notices that pics from your camera are always more flattering. really easy to use if u 've ever used a camera before. small n slick almost like a mobile phone.|#|some of the features are not really that useful. the flash is alittle too strong.
9.0|#|This is an excellent camera for the less technical operator - point and shoot, it takes all the hassle out of getting good pictures. Low light pictures have been excellent, even when taken in a hurry. The size is excellent for taking on holiday and the functions are easy to access on the touch screen.|#|The battery is a bit fiddly and I have yet to work out how long it lasts. I think the functions use up quite a bit of power.
9.0|#|lovely size, like the fact the lens has solid protection...many many feature|#|struggle with the wrist strap

10.0|#|In fact we even insist on buying Sony tv's because of the quality we know we will experience|#|Sometimes when I try to take pictures of the moon the flash goes off. If the camera is so clever at deciding whether landscape, macro or whatever else, why can it not decide that the moon isa long-distance shot, and suppress the flash?
10.0|#|EVERYTHING|#|CLOSING A BIT FIDDLEY
10.0|#|Easy to use, small and compact.  I have taken lots more photos when out and about of my children as its a great compact size to have in my bag and doesn't take up any room.|#|
10.0|#|It's very sharp, and the way it focuses. It's size is unique. Small enough to carry in your pocket or handbag and heavy enough to know it's there or you've forgotten to pick it up when you've placed it down.|#|It's very easy for the slide to move back down and switch it back on when you have switched off this way in the first place so I try to remember to switch it off The top.

10.0|#|everything|#|none
9.0|#|We previously had the Sony N1, the T90 is a step forward for both feature and ease of use.  Face recognition works well and auto detection of the frame setting is also good, I.e. auto selection of scene, portrait, night etc; the camera can also be set to auto detect for macro shots.|#|Battery life is not as good as the N1, however, this is a function of size, therefore the compact size and weight more than compensate this.
9.0|#|will get a lot of use|#|It wasnt made clear that it only takes memory stick pro duo with an unobtainable CF adapter
9.0|#|There are a good range of quality lenses available and for the cost conscious a good range of existing Minolta lenses fit with auto focus still available.|#|Just one bad point - would have been nice to have bluetooth for sending pictures quickly to external devices but even so that doesn't detract from the overall pleasure of the camera.
10.0|#|Great camera, fast, very well featured - think A350 with a 10.2Mp sensor.  Live view is great.|#|Shutter is quite loud
8.0|#|The manual focus and zoom really allow me a lot of flexibility that I couldn't get from our last camera.  We use this camera alongside a diffuser quite often and it has absolutely no problem handling the different strengths of light.  It takes amazing quality of photo's even in the poorest of light conditions and the night modes have come in handy time and time again as we have to take alot of photo's of products with fibre optics and led lights!|#|The RAW images have to be converted to TIFFS before we can open them up in photoshop, which can be quite time consuming if we've taken alot of photos.  Sometime the camera will refuse to take a photo if it thinks the light is too low, if we're trying to take a long exposure of an item that flashes, sometimes it may not register.  Although there is probably a setting somewhere to turn this feature off!
9.0|#|Liveview AF is just amazing. the battery gives you an actual percentage of how much power is left in it. the 2.7inch screen is tiltable and the 3fps speed is not bad at all. you can use almost any Monilta and Konica lens cause they will all fit an alpha model|#|hard to think of any
9.0|#|Good all rounder.  Easy to use, with lots of features to use if required. Live view, on the angle, is better then I thought it would be.  Good software package especialy the Raw convertor.|#|The lens supplied is poor.  I purchased, a reduced priced, Tamron lens with my camera and am glad I did so. The pictures from this are absolutely fabulous.
10.0|#|Excellent product. Easy to use (even for the novice). Can be used fully automatic for a quick point and shoot, or fully manual for the more demanding photographs. The flip out LCD screen is great especially for low level work. Value of money, can hold its own with its main comperitors and save you £100's.|#|Not as many lens options to chose from, unlike its main competitors. CF cards are a old format of memory and are expensive compared to newer memory types.
8.0|#|Fastest auto-focus of any D-SLR on the market, pull out screen, great kit lens with longer focal range than most of the competition, good battery life, well packaged with good accessories and great value for money.|#|Image on screen in live view and image recorded not always 100% the same, pop-up flash low in hight and can cast very slight shadows when using an extended lens, display can become fuzzy in low light making live view harder to use, build quality is a little insubstantial, optional battery grip is very expensive!
9.0|#|High specification camera for the price, easy to use in the auto setting modes but enogh option and quality to grow with me as my skills grow. I have always had good quality digital cameras but from the first picture the quality of picture from this SLR was so much better.|#|Instruction manual was not detailed enough to support the beginner that is keen to do more
8.0|#|good design, good value of money, nice live view|#|not so good kit lens
9.0|#|Lovely camera to use.  Very well equipped and caters for all the needs of someone like me who is stepping up from a point and shoot.  I bought a digital field guide on this model written by Tom Bonner which has proved to be very useful and quickly encouraged me to move off Auto setting to fully explore my own abilities as well as the camera's. After a lot of experimenting I have produced some stunning photos and my confidence has greatly increased.  This is an excellent camera.  Go get one.|#|When outside the liveview images are often very difficult to see which I feel negates a large part of its usefulness.  I tend to use the viewfinder mostly and, when you consider that the A200 had a better viewfinder, it may be (depending on your requirements) sensible to save yourself money and get the A200.  That being said, the liveview does give you an extra dimension and the x2 teleconverter.
10.0|#|I'm very pleased with the results and handling and the fact that I start using all my Minolta lenses once more!|#|Nothing really.
9.0|#|LCD is crisp and bright. And tilt-able, which is a GOD SEND!|#|Sensor seems very prone to dust. The in-camera dust reduction isn't worth having.
9.0|#|It's just a good camera and does what I want.|#|Some of the preset features cannot be changed. eg the ISO setting cannot be permananetly set and always starts in the AUTO mode.
10.0|#|I like the Live View and the tilting screen. i find the camera so easy and comfortable to handle.|#|None as yet.

9.0|#|Excellent picture quality, very easy to use, being able to see what you're photographing while you're doing it is brilliant.|#|Macro function isn't as good as I'd have liked, but there are special lenses for that so it's not that important!
9.0|#|Light weight, point and shoot or set it up yourself, good accessory range, good multifunctionality.|#|screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight, a common problem, can't use the teleconverter unless the display is on.

9.0|#|Great camera, a pleasure to use. Despite being new to DSLRs and advanced camera techniques, this is a very easy camera to use.

10.0|#|Good images, with even the kit lens|#|Other than that, not much wrong for the price.
9.0|#|The camera is a great size, the image stabiliser really works as does the dust reduction/sensor cleaner mode. Eye start is great if you are new to photography or give the camera to someone who doesnt know what they are doing and you want a sharp photograph.|#|On close shots (within a few feet) the flash can cast a shadow as it catches the front of the lens, in bulb mode a counter of how long you have been exposing for would have been nice (its on the Canons and saves you having to fiddle in the dark with a watch/timer), could have had more options for bracketing - maybe 5 shots instead of 3 but I'm just being picky. Other than that there is not much I can say bad against the camera...its fantastic, a great buy, could have more pixels but the low noise levels are a bigger benefit.
8.0|#|Compact size.  Ability to use old lenses with adapters.  Very good software included.  Ease of use with good results.|#|No tiltable screen or live view option.
6.0|#|Easy to hold. Live view is helpful.|#|
10.0|#|Does exactly what it says on the box. It works well in the hands of an amateur like me but can be used for the more sophisticated pictures with ease.|#|Rear LCD can become smudged and dirty when using the view finder only. Could do with a cover.
9.0|#|VERY EASY TO USE IF YOU ARE USED TO A COMPACT CAMERA, LIVE VIEW IS AMAZING COMPARED TO MORE EXPENSIVE CAMERAS, YOU CAN POINT AND SHOOT OR GET FULL CONTROL OF IMAGE IF YOU ARE MORE ADVANCED, THIS IS A CAMERA YOU CAN GROW WITH|#|THE ONLY DOWNSIDE TO THIS CAMERA IS THE OF CAMERA FLASH SYNC SPEED, IT NEEDS TO BE FASTER BUT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR MOST PEOPLE UNLESS USING STUDIO LIGHTS AND THEN YOU ALSO NEED A HOT SHOE ADAPTER
9.0|#|DSLR|#|Moving from a compact digital camera..
9.0|#|We are really pleased with it.  We had a compact digital before.  This takes pictures much quicker.  We also really like the additional lens that came with it.  We can see that we are going to have great fun with it.|#|Not sure that we have found any yet....

8.0|#|Results are very good and it's relatively easy to operate|#|Flash sometimes doesn't synchronise well, no means of zooming in on shots taken while viewing them on the small screen, I'd like Live View to be available through the eye-level viewfinder as well as the screen, which can find itself made unusable in sunny conditions
9.0|#|Easy to use , good quality , perfect lens for start .|#|Plastic casing.
9.0|#|good value|#|
9.0|#|Once the battery is charged you're ready to go and take pictures. Then after reading the book you can take more artistic or fast moving ones. No complaints, it's a great camera. It's my first SLR since my old OM10 and I'm so glad I made the commitment to buy.|#|Sometimes the auto focus gets a bit confused on a close up but that's the only thing I can think of
10.0|#|Using the camera can mean people keep asking you if your a professional, so it gives the right impression if you need it too|#|It's a little heavy, but then again i'm not use to holding SLR's, normally the compact digitals, but putting it around your kneck, the weight isn't really an issure, you'll get use to it
9.0|#|Like the tilting screen for taking pictures from a higher perspective.|#|Reflections on the viewing screen when there is strong sunlight mean that you have to use the eyepiece.

9.0|#|I trust Sony equipment. Anti shake is the reason I bought  this camera. The live view and moveable screen is great for me because  I  have a neck problem.|#|Not as good a build as my canon 400d
10.0|#|Feature packed as an SLR should be with the added bonus of familiar functions to a smaller digital camera. very quick and easy to pick up and use, the additional features will take longer to work through but bring benefits.|#|For me, hand grip is small and location of a button where my thumb sits makes it a bit fiddly,

9.0|#|thus making this camera perfect for me, My Chioce others may think differently.|#|If you buy something that you like and want then any bad points can be forgotten and put in to an area that says OK and they do not cause me a problem Up to Know I have not found any bad points but in time I may The fact that in comparison to othe DSL$Rs now on the market place this one a little larger but that suits me as I like a larger feeling camera compared to the Olympus and Lumix cameras that formed the group I looked at Before buying the Sony they all had winnig features but for me the Sony just had the edge. Time will tell but I think by buying into Sony has given me the scope to over come bad points.
9.0|#|Easy to hold, I like the eye shutdown and live view, also the fact that you can use live view overhead by lifting the back screen, good feature.

9.0|#|thus making this camera perfect for me, My Chioce others may think differently.|#|If you buy something that you like and want then any bad points can be forgotten and put in to an area that says OK and they do not cause me a problem Up to Know I have not found any bad points but in time I may The fact that in comparison to othe DSL$Rs now on the market place this one a little larger but that suits me as I like a larger feeling camera compared to the Olympus and Lumix cameras that formed the group I looked at Before buying the Sony they all had winnig features but for me the Sony just had the edge. Time will tell but I think by buying into Sony has given me the scope to over come bad points.

8.0|#|800) quilty starts to degrade fast.  Overall an excellent starter camera for keen amateurs which I have had hours of fun with.|#|No live view, which for standard shots of groups or portraights is no real drama, however when photographing wildlife and scenery this can be a little annoying for some shots.
9.0|#|The image quality is very good, and the help prompts and setting guides are useful to a newcomer to digital SLRs. Low light shooting provides accurate colours and contrast with little graining. The 18-55mm kit lens that came with the camera is surprisingly good, so I don't have to budget  straight away for additional lenses. The ability to review shots at 6x magnification helps me decide whether images are sharply focussed, long before I get home and view then on my computer screen. Overall, this camera is good value for money, and I look forward to using it each time I take it out with me.|#|I understand that entry level models are built down to a price, but even so, the build quality is less than what I expect from this manufacturer. Some buttons feel cheap, and the overall finish a little 'budget'. To be fair the finish doesn't affect the camera's performance, but it is up against some very well made opposition. I would like to have had 'Live view', however that is available form the next model up in the range.
10.0|#|I have had an SLR camera for years but as this is my first digital camera I have been really impressed at the straightforward instructions for use and the good results.  I am also particularly impressed that it is so light to carry and well balanced in your hand.  I am looking forward to learning more about the features and trying some manual focussing, etc.|#|
10.0|#|The quality of the camera is also backed with Sony's introduction of a range of quality yet affordable lenses as well as a huge back catalogue of Alpha mount Minolta lenses.|#|None that I have found.

9.0|#|This is a reasonable entry level SLR with plenty of features included. Nicely weighted and good all round performer.|#|Dont like the fact there is no live view on the LCD though and had I known this at the time of purchase I would have bought a different model. I also am not overly happy with the hand hold for the right hand which is a little useless especially when your hands are cold. Bring back the old grip any time soon please.
9.0|#|EXCELLENT ALL ROUND CAMERA AND SHOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY FOR A NEW COMER TO SLR CAMERAS|#|NONE
9.0|#|Feature packed, excellent picture quality and really easy to use. It allows the user to either manually decide on focus, exposure time etc or to let the camera default to what it assesses to be best.  This allows a lot of scope for more artistic and unique pictures.  Its small without being fiddley. Not long had it so just using it with the lens it came with but will be purchasing others to increase the possibilities.|#|Have not found any as yet.

8.0|#|Very easy to use and excellent picture quality on manual settings for a beginner to DSLR photography like me. The instruction interface on the camera display is superb. I also like the looks, quality and feel of the camera which did have influence on my purchase.|#|Accessories are very expensive i.e £80 for a spare battery I thought a little over the top. Whilst the picture results are superb the picture's received on the camera's auto setting wasn't as good as I hoped. This may well be a good thing though, as it made me make use of the cameras other more manual settings and thus make me more creative and experimental with excellent results. I also would like to have had a hand grip option as with other A series cameras in the Sony range.

9.0|#|Being smaller than the alpha100 is possibly better , but I don't expect SLRs to be small|#|Battery is smaller than the 100 and of courseit does not last as long. Yes you can carry a spare battery but they are expensive . With the 100, I never had a problem. I also liked the slightly longer focal length of the 100 camera -18/70 rather than 18/55

10.0|#|Always wanted a slr camera. The A230 is an excellent first timers camera. It is easy to use and produces great results.|#|Very minor bad point - I wish lens cap was attached to camera when in use. When on holiday recently it was sometimes difficult to find somewhere to put  it !
9.0|#|A nice starter camera, I got it for my other half who has wanted one for years, but had been holding out because of the massive price tags. I think this camera is a good balance of quality for price, obviously you expect less from this than from one three times the price, but what you get is very good value.|#|The camera doesn't feel quite as solid as one of its more expensive alternatives, but I have not had any problems at all with it so far.
10.0|#|I am a novice when it comes to using a DSLR so I wanted a camera which was competitively priced and easy to use. Although I have only had the camera a short time I have already found it a joy to use and cannot fault its performance. I think this is an excellent all round camera.|#|None

Its good that it comes with enough memory for around 30 pictures at 5megapixels, and space to add you own memory...which sony now provide in up to 4GB size.  Very easy to transfer pictures to the PC and the battery life so far is outstanding.|#|Can't seem to find a good sony case for it that fits it nicely and has room for a spare battery and memory card.  Also the tiny plastic clip that holds the battery in place looks very fragile, I'm a little worried it won't last as long as the camera itself. No other complaints.

10.0|#|So easy to use, I have had digital cameras in the past and you would need a degree to use them. With this one what you see is what you get.|#|I have not found any yet.
9.0|#|Night shots with flash are very good|#|Having replaced my previous Cyber-shot this one feels less sturdy as a lot of the metal casing has been replaced with metal

9.0|#|Flash quite powerful, large LCD screen, Good Shutter speeds...|#|Manual Focus
10.0|#|Light and easy to handle, with almost every shooting option one could wish for. The fastest shutter lag of any digital camera I've encountered, excellent flash, fast zoom, long battery life, excellent screen and excellent picture definition and contrast. Intuitive user interface makes it almost uneccessary to read the manual - though this gives excellent and clear guidance on the many functions available.|#|The controls are, perhaps, just a fraction too light - it's all too easy to accidentally turn the programme control onto a different setting, or to activate the zoom unintentionally - but familiarity soon overcomes these small problems and the overall ease of use is remarkably intuitive. The picture management programme on the CD is not the best - but again this is easily overcome with alternative packages on the computer.

9.0|#|Easy to use and camera can be be installed with the case within a minute. Good outer controls... used it in the the caribbean when diving and had no problems|#|The worst thing is that it doesn't come with any silicon beads to take all the moisture out of the casing which in turns causes fogging inside. The majority of other underwater casing come with small silicon bags to insert.  I had to go and find some from an old shoe box i had!

9.0|#|I bought it to take to Egypt. If you are after a compact that takes the chore out of taking photos in a hurry... Great looking and small, once you get used to the touch screen it's quick quite user friendly, the pictures are decent and shutter time is reasonably quick. the smile shutter works well, and is fun to play with|#|Couldn't find any that killed it for me. No digital zoom, but after shot software sorts that out.
9.0|#|QUick to shoot and good range of features, very good zoom - even whilst videoing.|#|Can occasionally catch your thumb in the photo as the lens is so far into the top corner - got used to holding the camera now so no worries.

5.0|#|Fairly similar to the T-10 I had previously feels nice to hold and has some great features for playing ie cropping photos adding symbols|#|Larger than T-10 but harder to use the touch screen compared to button controls which can take more time to get set up. Bigger screen does not make up for this.  Lack of view finder makes it hard to take photos in sunlight and picture quality at night is not good.
10.0|#|Touch screen functionality is very easy to use and makes access to the various functions easier.|#|The camera can be a little bit fiddly to hold, if you have big hands, but once you get used to where to hold it, then its fine. Care needs to be taken to ensure your fingers do not obstruct the lens when holding to take a photo.
8.0|#|. screen for viewing is very impressive.|#|using the big screen a lot, to review pictures, really hammers the battery life. The interface can make it hard to find certain features without the instructions in front of you.
8.0|#|Large viewing screen with no view finder - just point, view and snap! Touch Screen controls make i easy to access various features.|#|Perhaps too many features to make it easy for that quick photo. Manual doesn't make it too clear on how to work these features and what they can do for your picture. Battery runs out a bit too quick for my liking, but luckily a spare one cam with the camera.

8.0|#|Very good quality camera at a good price|#|
10.0|#|The image quality is really good for what I wanted it for - taking pictures on nights out. It seems pretty robust. It fits easily into my bag. Ideal for what I wanted it for.

7.0|#|Compact, strong|#|Having to use AA batteries, they don't last long and rechargeable ones are even worse.  so its quite expensive buying batteries.  Would be better it there was an internal battery as in a mobile phone, just plug in and charge it up.

Bought the camera for taking to sporting events - it has very fast shutter speeds.|#|Would have been nice to have a case included.

10.0|#|The Sony W300 is an excellent camera. The image quality is great, the amount of features is great and the camera was pretty easy to use with all settings. It has the best UI I have seen on a camera as it sets it out in a logical and simple way so that anyone can use it! The flash is amazing!! I took the camera into a pitch black room and took a random picture and it came out looking like the room had normal lighting in it. It is a very natural looking flash and does not have a huge white reflection as some of my previous cameras have had.|#|The pictures don't look like the 13.6MP shots they are meant to be, they look a little soft in some lights.
10.0|#|I upgraded from a Sony 4.1mp camera, I was torn between this camera and a Samsung one that was cheaper. I'm so please I stayed with Sony. I did a lot of research, there wasn't many reviews as it's a fairly new camera, and sells out quickly, but the reivews I found all said it was great. It's a fantastic camera and was a voted the best mid price range camera by The Gadget Show.|#|None at all.
10.0|#|Unbelievable camera, very sleek, good pics, very easy to use. I would definitely recommend it.|#|Nothing
10.0|#|I wanted a simple point and shoot digital camera that would take good quality pictures with little fuss. I did a lot of research and read several reviews on a wide range of camera's prior to deciding on the W300. This camera exceeds all of my expectations. It is very easy to use, the automatic smile detector really does work and I have some excellent photo's already. The automatic focus is excellent and the zoom (although only 3x) is perfect. The titanium casing gives confidence and a feel of good quality. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who doesn't want to carry around a bulky SLR or spend time setting up the shot.|#|
9.0|#|i have had a number of compact digital camera over the years and this is laden with features especially the ablitiy for multiple shots with the press of the button. picture quality for me was excellant, but it does depend on where you get them developed. the facility to show on HD tv is an added bonus.

9.0|#|Sound quality from the manufacturer in term of the build and reliability.  Great pictures in some pretty unique environments from New Zealand canoeing to the dusty landings in Afghanistan.  Sharp detail and good reproduction of colours, controls are familiar from older cameras which helps you find your way around it quickly to the newer function sooner.|#|Maybe a little expensive, especially the additional lens adaptors you can add to it which was my initial intention.
8.0|#|Has an underwater casing and very good for scuba diving as an easy point and shoot.  Small and neat and great screen.  Like the ISO settings.|#|Not a great zoom, but enough for most shots.  Rather easy to inadvertently turn the dial for different types of shots.  Battery life not brilliant.

9.0|#|oh and SRAW is great|#|the only gripe I have is the limited lens selection although this seems to be improving and there are some very nice Sigma, Tamron and Sony lenses on the way!
9.0|#|The numerous buttons, instead of the use of a menu, makes this extremely fast and easy to use when circumstances change.|#|No live view or moveable screen.  I have an A300 with this feature and it is necessary when shooting from low or high angles.  I would have paid extra for this feature.
9.0|#|Excellent auto exposure, decent fps, fast focus - especially at f/2.8. Works well with my Sigma flash units.|#|Loses the multi-function dial of the A100
10.0|#|Excellent value for money. Go get one if you're thinking of it and sitting on the fence|#|Could do with a top view screen but the main screen is so easy to manipulate that it really compensates for not having it.
10.0|#|Feels solid and well built in the hand. The menu function is very intuitive and it's easy to change camera settings quickly.Having just upgraded from the alpha 100 which is in itself  a very good camera the alpha 700 takes your photography to a whole new level.|#|Haven't found any yet although live view would be a useful function to have.

10.0|#|at photographic web sites like flickr.com to see what amazing pictures it takes. No live view, no video, haven't missed it a bit.|#|Not bad news really, but a bit of warning! If you considering to upgrade to this camera - this is where your hobie starts to get SERIOUS - will need to invest in some prime lens to fully appreciate what the camera can do:)) Also,  learn to use a photo editing software. Results will amaze you.
10.0|#|I would recommend this camera for both beginners and semi professional users..|#|I have found nothing to complain about since purchasing this camera
9.0|#|Excellent build quality. Flexible and easy to use. First class picture quality.|#|CompactFlash memory slot reversed, makes memory card difficult to remove. No live-view.

9.0|#|Stylish, very well made and robust. Looks like it cost a £1000 the price paid in a shop. Versatile, easy to use and simple overall operation.|#|Slightly over-engineered, but I like that. Hard to remember the acronmys and letters.
9.0|#|Produces excellent images.  Sits well in the hand.  Good quality, reasonably priced Sony lenses  available.|#|I can't think of any
8.0|#|It compares very favourabley with a Nikon D300. Fast Af and easy to use controls. Very bright viewfinder. Jpegs look great, straight out of camera.|#|The buttons/controls are easy to accidentally change, when putting the camera in a bag. Knowing this, it is simple to check when taking back out.
9.0|#|This is the best camera I have ever used. On full auto it produces brilliant images, and when I have mastered all the other features it has, it will be even more enjoyable. I have visited several camera clubs recently, and everyone is very impressed with my images. When I can use it properly, following advice and practice, it can get even better.|#|As this is my first full DSLR camera, I don't think it has any bad points. I have nothing to compare it with, other than previous point and shoots. The difference is stunning. For a novice like me it requires the purchase of additional instruction books in order to understand how to use the features. Supplied literature seems to work on the principal that you already know everything.
9.0|#|Given my existing Minolta AF lenses a new lease of life. Great build quality. Excellent list of features.|#|Flash guns to fit are expensive.
10.0|#|All the advances over the A700, which was a very good camera|#|Will advise if any arise

10.0|#|I am disabled, a wheelchair user. Most of the time I use the camera at airshows and need to use the panning technique, Because of my disability I am not able to do this using the normal technique and am therefore unable to hold the the camera with two hands, so I have to use it with just one hand and I have found that the weight/balance of the camera is just right. The controls are easy to use|#|The back screen is very dificult to see in bright sunlight. It would be improved if the 'Live View' screen was made available on this model.
9.0|#|Image quality,build,ease of use,exposure,excellent AF,versatility,speed.|#|Heavy on batteries,high ISO image quality (above iso 1000!)
10.0|#|Extremely easy to use you soon find your way around the camera; all the controls are in the right place. It can be used casually relying on the cameras ability to take care of exposure even in the trickiest of lighting conditions I have found it never lets you down. Very occasionally in tricky situations it does not give what you might be expecting, but I guess it cant know what my preferences are.  As well as all the automatic functions I like all the manual functions and the amount of control I can have. I find its capabilities very reliable and it gives me great confidence to know I will get the photo I want. I think it feels solid and well made and it produces top class results. I also like the fact that it can use the old Minolta AF lenses, I absolutely love it, the display is a joy to look at.|#|Can,t think of any, probably a bit more life out of the battery, but it is not a problem
9.0|#|Most importantly  this camera has great ergonomics with all controls within easy reach whilst you eye is at the viewfinder. As with all the DSLRs in the range, image stabalisation is built into the camera body itself  so it is available on all lenses. Although the range of lenses is still fairly small and there are not as many third party lenses available as there are for say Canon or Nikon, eqivalent lenses are less expensive as they do not need image stabalisation built into them, however quality lenses can be had at bargain prices because all lenses designed to fit the Minolta A mount will fit and all functions will work. Easy to use. It makes a great point and shoot camera for those family snapshots as well as having enough features and quality of image to keep any semi-pro happy.|#|Only one really and that is the hotshoe mount is inherited from Minolta which means you need a manufacturer specific flash, and these are expensive. The situation would not be so bad if the older Minolta flash units would work withh TTL metering. Although they fire and will auto zoom with some lenses all exposure needs to be done in manual mode as they will only fire at full power. A bit of  let down for me personally as I had just purchased one for my Minolta film body assuming that it would also work with the Alpha A 700. More research in future me thinks.
10.0|#|Enjoyable to use, full manual control over every thing, great viewfinder and screen, excellent pictures as a result.|#|Some controls could be moved onto the joystick. that's all.
8.0|#|The way it fits into your hands--ergonomically just perfect.|#|No live view or HD and for a camera this price there should be at least one or the other---the opposition will flaunt these points and the Alpha series could suffer sales as a consequence.
9.0|#|Solid build quality, good image quality, comfortable to handle, large bright screen, high shutter and motor drive speeds.|#|Multi use of certain buttons confusing at times. A smoother shape would help in keeping body clean
8.0|#|Fantasic view finder, great control layout, metal body, lcd screen quality, alpha mount|#|Lack of live view and video, but it is a stills camera after all :-)
9.0|#|pretty accurate. option to use two typres of memory card useful, all in all a great camera.|#|live view would help on occasions, but I am very used to the V/F. Lack of video not a big issue for me, I like taking stills !
10.0|#|Intuitive and easy to use. A nice grip and excellent screen make this a really great camera to use. Simple ideas such as the screen rotating 90 degrees in portratit mode add to the usability of the camera. I have always owned Minolta cameras starting with the X500.|#|The really good lenses are out of reach in terms of cost.
10.0|#|5 The remote control shutter release|#|3 On the vertical grip, the AF/MF button is too close to the thumb pad
10.0|#|Great to hold and use if you have larger hands|#|The autofocus/manual focus switch is a little small and therefore fiddly to move.
10.0|#|The camera does everything that I have asked of it from working in the hottest to coldest of climates.|#|Focussing can be tricky in low-light or low contrast conditions but a scan around the subject identifies an edge or line that can be used.  A difficulty that is quickly learnt and overcome.
10.0|#||#|The extra features this A700 has over my A100 took some getting used to, as it a serious bit of kit! As with ALL APS sized sensors, you gain a lot on the telephoto end but lose on the wide angle end instead, however, so I had to buy another wide angle lens as well, chosing the Sony 11-18 mm.
9.0|#|Overall, I'm really impressed with this camera. A brilliant upgrade from the already amazing Alpha100!|#|
9.0|#|Having moved from a Dynax D7 to this camera I am highly delighted. It is a superb camera and willbe with me for many years.|#|None yet.
10.0|#|A very capable camera. It feels good in your hands, solid, proffessional, a product to be proud of. Metering is extremely good and provides a good base to work from. I don't have Sony lenses but used with Sigma and Tamron lenses the results are sharp and clear. I like the viewfinder which gives good clear sight of the subject. The accessories bundled with the camera, in particular the remote release, are generous and useful. The rear screen is clear. I thought the buttons were a bit scattered at first but now I'm used to their positioning I can see the logic. A great product and a big step up from my A200 which I really liked as well.|#|I'm always concerned when working in inclemant weather. I would like the camera to have better weather proofing, especially around the card door.
9.0|#|really good image quality when shot in raw format|#|need to be careful with exposure as can tend to over expose in some situations

10.0|#|an excellent camera, and really enjoy using it. has taken time to get to know the features, sure I have not mastered all of then, but will in time|#|non
9.0|#|Good spec, easy to use, wide range of accessories.  Particularly like the built-in remote control and the remote firing of the dedicated flashgun. Am STILL experimenting with some of the features. HDMI output works well.  Was unsure at having no Live View when I bought it, but have found that it is not as important as I thought it might be - as a long time film SLR user I managed without it, and have just carried on the same way, but the settings display is much easier to read than on my old fashioned SLR.  Manual is comprehensive. Battery indicator is excellent and battery life good.|#|Rear screen marks quite easily (though it does not affect visibility of information). I have not purchased a battery grip - seemed very expensive when all I wanted was a spare battery ON the camera, but I have had years of practise at turning the camera to portrait mode and using the original controls so do not need the extra set of buttons. (I was advised by one multi-branch retailer that battery grips were no longer available for the A700, which nonsense resulted in my purchasing the flashgun elsewhere). No major problems or concerns.
10.0|#|It encourages me to learn and experiment with a responsive camera, and has produced some staggering pictures|#|
9.0|#|Such an advance over my A200, much faster, better built, amazing screen resolution, and far easier lay out with the buttons.|#|chunkier feel than A200, needs time to master, lacking live view

9.0|#|The Minolta camera heritage combined with Sonys technical expertise, the relative simplicity and designed for experienced camera users. no gimmicks. solid feel. ability to use Minolta lenses. excellent value.|#|Only dust on the sensor - not Sony's fault!
9.0|#|Easy to use. I mainly do medical photography, so on occasion have to trust others to use the camera for me, which they find easy.|#|The way it autofocuses before the shoot button is part depressed is irritating. I have not yet found a way of stopping this.
10.0|#|Overall Im very very pleased with this camera.|#|I have really found no bad points.
9.0|#|VERY EASY TO USE EVEN IN MANUALMODES|#|

9.0|#|large bright screen, intuitive menu, image quality is brilliant up to 800ISO, Zeiss and G lenses a match for any Canon and Nikon pro lenses.|#|ISO starts to drop from ISO800 but is usable and Sony really need to make a wireless connection to Laptops.
9.0|#|Handling, ergonomics, user interface, build quality, speed, viewfinder, image quality, customisability, amazing value for money|#|lack of main sensor live view, lack of autofocus micro-adjust, relative scarcity of Sony accessories
8.0|#|Bracketed exposures work well, solid feel to the body, integral pop up flash, simple menu system, programmable dial settings for common settings, image quality at low ISO's is good, solid ergonomics.|#|High ISO noise, limited lenses compared to Nikon and Canon.
8.0|#|Image quality not as good as my canon but acceptable|#|
9.0|#|Handles well, feels right in the hands, many newer cameras are too small to hold comfortably. Good viewfinder. It doesn't need live view. Excellent image quality, A3 prints easily achieved.|#|No longer in production. Some Minolta accessories need to be revived provide a professional range.
8.0|#|Very ease to use. Using well into higher ISO. Leaves out of the 'whistles and bells' A photographer -not a toy. Well built with its body. Using settings from outside the body, no fiddling in menu.  Good LCD and the IS and the - not a mirror , a penta EV.  Able to using CF and Sony cards. The best of any Sony SLR. Better than even your A900!!!|#|Will need quality lenses; but also any SLR; otherwise will let it down images. Reviewing jumps to high cropping; should be in steppings.  Otherwise will hold its head with any quqlity SLR.
10.0|#|excellent camera,|#|kit lens has mixed reviews????
9.0|#|Great features, build quality and superb image quality. Upgrading from the Alpha 100, the difference in the image quality and better ISO performance is quite remarkable. Alpha 100 really struggled with noise at anything over ISO 200, whereas the Alpha 700 is great up to ISO 800 and beyond.|#|Would be nice to have more megapixels with the same features  of the A700 camera, for even more flexibility.

9.0|#|Intuitive, ease of use, great viewfinder|#|None
10.0|#|Significantly more responsive than entrylevel DSLRs. The added buttons makes it faster and easier to change settings while shooting and quicknavi is great for more changes. Focusing is also much faster and accurate both in good and bad conditions.|#|As a prosumer camera it is somewhat heavier than entrylevel dslrs and bigger, something I haven't become fully accustomed to yet. It is also lacking the live view of newer models.
5.0|#|easy to use|#|Minolta lenes, not as good as nikon, and not a lot of them
9.0|#|Love my camera, is small, neat and I can work out how to take a picture in most circumstances. It's red - colour is fab and eye catching.  Gives me excellent pictures and I can have it in my bag to take pictures when I want too.  Downloading pictures isn't the easiest process but I get there in the end.|#|battery life isn't great - have to keep spare batteries charged ready for when I need them.  The menus are not easy to follow and I have to rely on the handbook a lot as the menus don't link together very easily.
10.0|#|It's a compact little camera with lots of features including built in memory.|#|Slight problem with the sliding opening mechanism which is a little awkward at times but otherwise no bad points.

10.0|#|Good photos, looks really good. Nice big screen to view photos. nice flash. Great detail in pics.|#|Video could be better quality. Some shaky shots even on easy settings. Wish the setting to change it to sepia or black and white was more obvious. Also would be useful to make it clearer when you have left it on movie, like the n2 has a slider option for view, photo and movie.

10.0|#|High sensitivity means excellent photo results in low light conditions and no need for flash to spoil soft lighting. Beautiful look camera. Good price. Self timer takes 5 pictures at once to ensure you capture at least one good photo of you and your friends. Would recommend.|#|
9.0|#|This classic point and shoot is perfect for those who want to take good pictures but don't want to carry cumbersome equipment with them. Recommended to me by two professional photographers I've since bought them for three family members who've been similarly impressed. It has an almost zero shutter delay, a good variety of settings and you can take movies as well (with sound). Does exactly what it says on the tin!|#|

10.0|#|Good response time between pressing the shutter button and the camera actually taking the picture, this is one thing I wanted on my new camera as the old one used to take an age to respond.|#|You have to supply/buy your own memory card for this camera and if you don't have one the internal memory is so small it can only fit about four photo's on it.

7.0|#|Overall a decent camera - good pictures, reasonably fast shutter reaction.|#|Why do Sony persist in proprietary interfaces? Instead of the usual mini-USB, they have their own fitting, so you have to have that with you to download. Then they have their own memory card format, which is more expensive than the generic SDs. Their software is not Windows 7 compatible, and when I enquired on this to their helpdesk I received an unhelpful response. They have a good product but their apparent arrogance lets them down.
10.0|#|Very compact and stylish. Displayed info when changing settings very helpfulfor the amateur photographer. When all else fails,  auto settings come into their own.|#|Being an amateur photograher, I cannot see any bad points.

9.0|#|2.  Although intially I felt the smile recognition was a bit of a gimmick, it became extremely useful when at a family function I was able to shoot 'picture shy' family members without making it too obvious that I was doing so, Once the camera had 'made' the recognition it fired the shutter without me touching it, thus I could hold the camera away from me, and still get a natural smiling shot.|#|Found that it is best to turn off 'face detection' when shooting landscape scenes. The problem is that if camera has been left with 'face detection' on at last time of use, then one can forget and not take it off. Thus the camera searches for a face to recognition.

9.0|#|Great all round.  Brilliant picture quality.|#|Sometimes the auto focus focuses on the wrong thing.  eg taking a picture of a subject far away with something very close to the foreground i.e. railings or a cage, the camera will focus on the railings or cage and make the subject blurry.

It fels ncie in the hand and a quality product!|#|The button that takes the pictures is in the wrong place... i keep having to look at it in order to take a picture whereas the previous Sony i had was fine... I think it is because there is another face recognition button alongside.... I would also like the ability for the lens not to automatically open out when you turn on the camera as sometimes you may just want to view pictures or film footage- it is annoying!
10.0|#|this is the best camera ive had so far everyone ses its brillaint fotos haha smetimes too good coz it shows me imperfections witch my old crap cam didnt do haha it wanted a dlr cam or whatever they r but there too exensive and too big to lug around in my handbag hehe|#|none really lol exept the mem card dont fit into my computer so have to use the wires lol but thats sonys fault not currys haha oh well still brill!!!! and that sony wont let anyone but themselves sell any mem stik bigger than a 4gb -_-
8.0|#|The HX-1 has an amazing point and shoot capability.  It has many automatic features and a great processing engine that seem to cope with any lighting condition.  I think it does this better than the Nikon D300.  Focus is fast and accurate.  Start up time is pretty good and shutter lag is almost nonexistent.   The burst mode at 10fps is great, but has limitations (see AGAINST).  Its all housed in a compact and well designed case and is a breeze to carry around all day (unlike the D300!). The zoom lens will take you out to 686mm (35mm equivalent) and 1166mm with the optional 1.7x tele-convertor.|#|Conclusion : For dedicated sports and wildlife photography, you cant beat a proper dSLR and the HX-1 will disappoint you.  But for great holiday snaps and day to day use, the size, ease of use and features of the HX-1 are perfect.
9.0|#|Very good easy shoot mode results.|#|Need a few weeks to read the manual! And may need to carry around pages for reference!
10.0|#|Camera feels comfortable to hold and use, and the control buttons are easily located. Custom settings are simple to apply and very useful. The definition obtained from the zoom lens is first class throughout its entire range. I am very pleased with it.|#|They give no extras at all in the package. No case or useful size memory card. There is no provision for use of filters; I like to have a uv for protection, and I often use a polariser. I have managed to get over this by making up a push-on ring with a step up ring to hold the filters - it works well!
9.0|#|mode cuts out all the jargon for point and shoot.  Low light shooting - where 5 burst shots are made into one gives very good quality.   The panoramic option give stunning horizontal or vertical shots of near 180 degrees.   Battery life is good - lasting over a week on holiday.   Not intended to be a professional's camera - but a very very good camera for someone who wants high quality and low weight and size with lots of options and simplicity of use|#|Wide variation in price from under two hundered upwards - look around.  Video quality excellent HD and way beyond other cameras - though stabilisation fails a little on panning.  Accompanying software for PCs is overcomplicated - but not to worry, Pictures view easily on Windows and highest HD setting movie can be run via Media centre on faster PCs
10.0|#|jog dial which is also much better positiioned) at the top right corner of the rear, just where the heel of the hand tended to be placed when holding the camera; a small but most effective change to the ergonomics to Sony's credit - about time!|#|camera.
9.0|#|A friend is very impressed.|#|
9.0|#|It has virtually everything I had with my expensive SLR digital system, with a better zoom and image stabiliser, and weighs nearly 2kg less than the kit I used to carry around my neck or stuffed into my photographic jacket pockets, and I do not have to worry about dust getting into the camera body during lens changing aas every thing is sealed in the DSX-HX1. The continuous modern technological developments mean that I have many more features than my expensive SLR system had and all for the cost of  less than my SLR camera body without any lenses. On a two week whale watching trip my companions had SLR's and I was the  only one able to take very acceptable video clips.|#|My major gripe has to be the lack of a thread on the lens barrel to allow a filter or lens hood to be fitted. Carrying out taping an old filter holder in reverse to allow a UV or polaroid filter to be attached as suggested by a number of sites on the Internet is a little naff, although it does work  It does however leave a lens needing a lens hood in many shooting situations therefore a wide angle type is needed.  Many professional reviews indicate a loss of quality at the edges of pictures, a loss I only just about notice at the very extreme edges, and one which is so easily removed by allowing for cropping when taking a picture. The DSC-HX1 lacks RAW and a control on JPEG compression, but, like most photographers, I do not use RAW and the compression has still been such that some of my pictures after cropping at 'glossy' magazine premises have been printed full page, and achieve the WOW factor in my lectures. While the overal camera size does not allow it to slip unobtrusive into a pocket it is of a manageable size..
9.0|#||#|when I pay money for a good camera I want to look after the lens and to find Sony don't have a lens adaptor to enable the fitting of a protective filter was annoying-however that was solved by a purchase (from the USA of a lens adaptor) and my lens is now filtered
9.0|#|the camera is easy to use with many functions and although is a bridge camera has the quality of a DSLR but the ease of a compact point and shoot.|#|the screen doesn't come with a protector and as it is quite dominant at the back of the camera it gets finger marks easily and although you can purchase a screen protector separately it isn't readily available from shops. Also no memory card with the camera and the internal one isn't very big
10.0|#|Once i got the hang of all the features it was a great point and shoot camera. A great camera for an enthusiastic amateur or someone who wants a point and shoot camera for close ups and with a good zoom for distance shots. I used this on safari and got some great shots where time was of the essence. SLR's are great but not so quick to catch wildlife on the move. Changing lenses can get messy with all the dust.|#|Took me a little while to work out all the features and navigate them.
8.0|#|20X zoom, wide range of features (particularly high speed burst - 10 in 1, 2 or 5 secs - and panorama exposures), ease of adjustment of ISO, aperture, shutter speed and/or EV when feasible, small and light, diopter adjustable EVF (latter would benefit from being larger) and good battery life.|#|Inevitable grain at lower light intensities requiring higher ISO settings, bright areas of image that tend to lack detail (countered by setting a small, negative EV that could be at the touch of a button if the 'custom' control included EV setting but it doesn't - only  smile shutter, white balance or metering mode).  LCD screen of 'soft' plastic that might damage easily (I've bought a protective over layer from Amazon to reduce the possibility), LCD screen that moves up and down but not left/right or facing inwards for protection, and a cover for the download sockets that is not hinged but tethered by a plastic tag (time will tell how long this lasts).  Initial price high but not really unreasonable.
10.0|#|Great picture quality, has lots of different functions which I haven't used all of yet! Fantastic Zoom and the panaramic picture function. Defintly consider this camera!!|#|When u use the shutter and take 10 frames per second takes a while to load the picture before u can take more photos. But for me this is not an issue!!
9.0|#|Good intermediate camera to move up to from a point and shoot. Does lots for you on 'auto' but you can take over and become quite proficient with time. I am already experimenting with setting my own shutter and light settings having noted the ones used by the auto mode. I have been used to a different make of camera but on swapping found the controls quite easy to adapt to.  Great extra features like Smile, panoramic and up to 10 shots in a burst. Finally 20x zoom is more than adequate and easily controlled.|#|It takes only a 'Sony' battery but it seems to last well long enough on a charge for my use. Will be investing in a spare soon. Also had to buy a memory card before I could use it, comes with a small built in memory only like most.
8.0|#|Focal length range makes it very vesatile. Good quality video.|#|Pictures very noisy in PROGRAMME mode but ok in SCENE mode.

9.0|#|Bought this camera about a month ago to take on holiday and although there was not an in depth manual to take with me the camera was so easy to use that a manual was not needed. The picture quality is excellent and the diplay bright and vivid, controls are well placed and easy to understand. Comfortable to hold, light in weight and easy to carry around. managed to use most of the settings and found the video to be smooth in its playback. all in all an excellent choice and would highly reccomend.|#|small niggly points to mention is that you have to change the viewfinder mode ( which I use most of the time to take photos ) to the LCD every time you want to preview photos taken, it would have been nice if the default was to preview images straight to LCD. Also you have to keep remembering to take off the lens cover before you switch on the camera otherwise it pops off by itself, and most important a lens filter/protector would have been nice even as an extra as always worried that the lens would get scratched by accident, but these are minor problems and would not stop me from reccomending this camera
8.0|#||#|Nothing really BAD as such
9.0|#|--- the local outlet wanted almost GBP 200 more than I paid on-line.  Technically it has all the features one could expect and the video is amazing quality|#|info strips obscuring about 25% of the screen.  The software to transfer images/video to a PC seems very cumbersome after Olympus !
10.0|#|I particularly like the Panoramic, the super zoom and the multi shot capability.|#|Lens isnt threaded to take filters.
10.0|#|Excellent physical build: form and function in harmony, basically everything you would expect from this manufacturer. The panoramic sweep is top notch, a very good feature which will no doubt be copied by many others.  I have seen whinges from others about the battery time but to my mind this is a non-issue. Quick startup and image processing. Has the ability to either be turned into the near slr type of camera with many adjustabilities, or to be a straightforward point and shoot : a chameleon of cameras.|#|You have to buy a nice case seperately.
9.0|#|Ease of use, HD movie mode, zoom lens, panaorama and low light shot features, LCD viewer, flash quality, manual modes, macro|#|Build quality a bit suspect in places, e.g lens cap and nasty plastic cover for sockets, battery access flap (but otherwise good); irritating message that comes up when using non Sony branded memory sticks
10.0|#|Great images, clear screen and pretty easy to use|#|slightly too bulky but considering capability is still very good compared to SLR
8.0|#|I like the fact you have the choice of taking a photo either through the  view finder or using the LCD screen.  However when using the view finder you cannot immediately view what you have taken without pressing the button to change it back to LCD screen and then you have to press the button again to take another photo via the view finder which if you want to a shot quickly is not very good.|#|
10.0|#|Video quality is also excelent but for me the HX1 will not replace a higher range camcorder.|#|Processing can be somewhat slow on certain presets. Charging the battery in the standard charger is a bit slow (I also have a Sony camcorder with the same battery type which charges much quicker so I usually put the camera battery in the camcorder and charge it through the camcorder to save time).

9.0|#|I think that the DSC-HX5 offers a high specification for both photography and video within a compact size camera that combines a high quality feel with ease of operation at a reaonable price. The features such as panorama, hand-held twiilight and anti-motion blur all works very well and are extremely useful in everyday situations. The HD video has produced good video and sound quality results for recording musical performances in low light conditions, even when hand held. The range of the zoom lens is perfect, keeping the body compact and light. Battery life seems very good so far.After much research I feel that it meets my requirements and expectations for a bridge camera|#|No significant bad points after the first two months use.

Operates verry well as a full automatic in easy mode and there are program modes geared to the more experienced user.I took just the DX1 on a recent trip and was very pleased with the finished photos.|#|The only bad point is there is no method of attaching filter to lens to protect it from scratches etc which is a real mistake, however there are now options to buy customised adaptors via the internet

I traded in my digital SLR for this bridge camera and have not looked back. 20x optical zoom is excellent coupled with a near-perfect optical stabilization system. Twilight mode is superb for taking shots in low light without a flash, great for concerts and stage events. The sweep panorama feature may seem a bit of a gimmick, but once you have used it a couple of times it becomes a real benefit. Action shots are captured brilliantly with the 10 shots per second burst mode.|#|I found the camera to be larger than I thought. You need a kit bag for this one - not a trouser pocket.

9.0|#|Great zoom,  panaramic photos are so easy to do and twilight shots or low light shots are all taken care of with this camera. It also has 1080HD video with amazing results. I highly recommend this camera.|#|None
10.0|#|User friendly excellent image quality, power of lens, plus reasonably good control  between aperture and shutter  priorities. outstanding HD video|#|limited f stops, cannot go slower than 125 ISO, does not have a live view finder,error message with 8 gig cards
8.0|#|Excellent picture quality, easy to use in auto modes, good range of options for differing lighting,scene type,desired effects. However the complexity of options makes for a long learning experience to utilise them properly (not a bad point for the camera but a consideration for the user).|#|View screen needs better scuff and impact protection. Need more options on strap adjustment.
9.0|#|loved the panorama shooting|#|lenscover pops off even if you are just viewing
9.0|#|Feels and behaves far superior to its earlier models H9 and H50, althoughbecause it does not condense the pictures it tends to be a litle slower between taking a picture and viewing it|#|Lack of an infra-red zapper
9.0|#|What makes this camera a must buy for me is the HD video feature. Top class results when viewed on a PS3|#|The 20x optical zoom is a bit disappointing at  full zoom, a tripod would be advised
9.0|#|Tele 1.7 available|#|Some functions missing (compare to SX1IS)
10.0|#|This is a well designed quality bridge camera.  By comparison to my previous one, a Konica Minolta A200 the one thing I am finding a little trying is getting used to the power zoom.  I find this more difficult to control than the manual one, but otherwise at present I think the HX1 considerably outperforms the Konica.  I have been particularly impressed with the quality of image given when taking stained glass, and also the power of the flash.  There are still many features I have to explore.|#|It would have been good if Sony had provided some form of case for a camera of this cost.  I realise that the user may well want to have freedom of choice, but...
9.0|#|nice to handle, easy to use. Great to just pick up and go ......|#|W...can only be used with Apperture, shutter speed, or programme mode.
9.0|#|Very good camera really worth the money. Great price/value ratio. Sweep panorama and fast burst mode are cool. Good picture quality.|#|Cannot put polarization filters on. No sun shade accessory in the box. It is not full HD (1440x1080) but still the video quality is impressive. I would welcome a lock on the battery compartment. The screen should be tiltable to every side and it is not...
10.0|#|Its just FANTASTIC!|#|None.

7.0|#|Relatively fast response on startup, which is a good point seeing as how you have to constantly switch on due to 'power saving' function.|#|Jog wheel too sensitive to being pressed.
9.0|#|I spent a lot of time finding a bit about DSLRS and more specifically about bridge cameras before buying. Many reviews are performed by the 'top-end DSLR or nothing' brigade but i did find much useful information. The camera handles very well, is reasonably portable ( more so than the larger DSLRs) and most of the features are intuitive with buttons and menus well designed and laid out. Image quality is very good and the wide angle/zoom permits capture of good images in a wide range of conditions and for many types of photography. Operation is fairly quick and the panoramic, bracketing features are useful additions. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.|#|The only real frustration is that I have been unable to isolate say a flower and fully blur out the background. This seems to be a constraint of the fixed lens as much as my lack of familiarity with the camera. I have however achieved many decent photographs of close up objects and will keep trying to improve my technique.
9.0|#|I have always had a small digital camera (Sony) and wanted to upgrade to something with a bit more funtionality and quality, I have found this in the Sony Cybershot, being a novice to photography I found it very easy to use with some very pleasant surprises with the outcome, I still have a lot to learn but the manual is quite good at explaining technical issues and ideas.|#|None that I have come across so far

7.0|#|).|#|Although burst mode very good, it takes a long time to save and can miss next shots due to the time delay before camera will take another/more shots.
9.0|#|Superb LED screen - the tilting facility is a big plus.|#|The zoom would have been better placed where the shuttle wheel is. Not very easy being placed on the Shutter button!

10.0|#|A good pick up and point camera. I found it easy to use and fun experimenting with. It is a bit big but not heavy.|#|Haven't discovered any yet.
9.0|#|good camera with basic shutter and apature function. just started to play with these functions and it is a nice camera for a novice for this|#|also you change one of the settings to black and white, 3  modes in total go to black and white
8.0|#|Light weight with all the features that one could need for an advanced amateur.|#|On switch on the lens cap is forced off by lens extension if you forget to remove it.

9.0|#|Easy to use.  Produces great videos and focus stays sharp on zooming in.  Easy to use on screen display.  Viewfinder very useful in bright light conditions.

10.0|#|good quality, easy to use, great pictures|#|nothing

9.0|#|very good at night / extreme dark photos|#|no wide angle lens available
9.0|#|Versatile with uncommon features such as the ability to stich a panoramic photo within the camera itseslf. The range of settings are very good and the retention of a viewfinder is invaluable when taking photos in bright sun. Picture quality is, for a rank amateur, outstanding and the video feature an additional great bonus.|#|When using video mode the stereo pick up sound can be too sensitive i.e. too high so one can hear the takers breathing when not actually speaking. Camera construction does not make it suitable for putting into pocket or trousers.

8.0|#|Small for a digital SLR, very easy to use, great features such as excellent panoramic mode, lovely looking model, VFM, video capability, can use Sony memory card from other Sony goods, rechargeable battery, good quality lense for general purposes, good sized screen for viewing/taking photos instead of viewfinder.|#|No case included and this is quite expensive to buy separately from Sony, extreme close up picture quality is not good, poor internal memory (4 photos!) so you need to buy Sony memory card, no lense filter and can't buy one either as there's no thread to screw on to.
9.0|#|Price, nice working, lite|#|-
10.0|#|taking ten quick shoots and the panormanic shoot|#|not come a cross any yet
10.0|#|I bought  this camera because of its panoramic capacity whici seems to me very good.

9.0|#|Very easy to use and great zoom focus.  Full HD movie and the one shot panoramic mode are incredible.  Battery life seems pretty good as well.|#|Could do with a bit more on board memory but as you use cards anyway not a really big issue.
9.0|#|Overvall a very good purchase and I am not sure how i would survive without this camera.|#|Slightly too big to take skiing or other activities. However it is still ok in a rucksack if you ski with care.
9.0|#|Excellent camera, very easy to use with many good features especially for the price.|#|
10.0|#|The HX-1 SONY Camera is the best I have ever used. Its as close as it can get to a Pro SLR Camera, but with a HD Video recording this Camera makes it miles better. I dont have to carry 2 Bags with Camera and Camcorder, 2 chargers and so on. I have tried and tested the almost all the features on it and the results speak for itself with high quality and sharpness of the pictures and with high color definition. The HD Video recording with 20X Optical Zoom has great High Definition and brings all the small details in the video recording to life.Also with option of the a Mini HD Connection that allows me to view the great picture and video make this Camera top of my list. The Panaramic Sweep shot is great, as it takes about a 100 shots as you move your Camera from one side to the other, As where most of the other Camera's i have used will make you do the leg work by stitching 3 or 4 photo's yourself. I definitely would recommend it to everyone and already have done.|#|If I had to pick a bad point there would be only one. The Mini HD Connection option is great, but why they could not just fit a normal size HD Connect is beyond me, as this is one more little thing that we have to carry around and could easily lose.

10.0|#|Overall i think this product is brilliant. I have become a more keen photographer. In November i took the camera to a firework display and got some amazing photos on the firework setting, most of the programs are easy to use and understand.|#|I dont think that the booklet explains in as much detail as needed for a beginer to a digital SLR. The software to put photos on computer is very complex and hard to understand.
8.0|#|I bought this camera to use on a once in a life time trip to Antarctica. I photographed wildlife and the scenery.  I am very impressed by the prints I am now getting from my trip.  The panaramic feature really is excellent.  I had expected the cold to degrade battery life but I was not troubled by this.|#|Tracking birds in flight off the stern of a ship is an art I had trouble in mastering, particularly when zoomed in telephoto mode.  The image in the viewfinder is rather small
10.0|#|i love this camera, it's just so easy to navigate through with on screen menus and help, the quality of build is excellent feels so robust and strong. love the idea of adding your own music to your photos during playback, brilliant idea.|#|but overall i still love my camera.

10.0|#|I am no fantastic photographer by any means but this is  my third sony digital camera so easy to use and the build quality is  second to none,picture quality is fantastic from this model and the easy to use settings makes for real quality pictures , nearly as good as my sons photographer at his wedding and I did not get paid for the  pics that i took.|#|Still looking for any ,have not managed to find any yet.
10.0|#|The 20x optical zoom is better than many cameras and saves me carrying my DSLR around all of the time. The panoramic scan option is also excellent as I have found many different uses for that already where I would have needed to start attaching extra wide angle adaptor's etc. I also get to use the 'rapid fire' option frequently and have been delighted with results. The HD video is awesome and include the optical zoom with that for some stunning scenes.|#|I sometimes feel the image quality can be slightly grainy but maybe I should change settings to suit light etc. and experiment more.
9.0|#|The inteligent auto adjustment is excellent.  the menu is very user friendly, deleting images is quick especially to go through everyhing and only having to delete once and the fact that the cybershot cameras are universally the same made it easy when I changed to the HX1. I have already reccomened it and my friend bought it for christmas.|#|Glare from the sun on the viewing screen when taking pictures.  I don't particularly like using the view finder.  Is it possible to use an anti - glare material
10.0|#|Very user friendly.  The swoop feature is great and leads to getting some great photos of skylines.  See the Sony website for places that will enlarge your panoramic photo as when printed are small.|#|Lens cap doesn't stay on properly.

9.0|#|The wheel to make changes to the type of picture is stiffer in this design than the previous, and therefore doesn't move by mistake|#|Not a lot else, though the print quality is patchy, but then this is due to the sophistication of the processing types, I suspect.
9.0|#|Simple,straight forward instructions that even a novice like me can follow to produce excellent photos, especially using the telephoto lense.|#|The battery life is a limiting factor, and charging on the move over a long holiday is difficult.

Digitally it moves into the 100s x.  I would also have really like a fully tilt and turn LCD monitor on the back, not just the one the moves through the horizontal plane.  I could have had that had I spent far more on the top range Canon.

10.0|#|All in one package. Excellent for photos with huge range of options, particularly ability to tackle low  light situations. Panaorama feature and movie facility. Great looking camera.|#|Inability to down load movie clips into Pinnacle studio or other video editing suites to allow editing of clips and production of DVD disc.
9.0|#|HD movie is also a great feature.|#|Being a Sony, it uses MS Pro Duo rather than the more standard SD card, so not so compatible with all card readers, but this is a small price to pay and it is easy enough to buy a cheap USB card reader that you can carry around in a pocket.
9.0|#|how it feels. controls, picture quality, zoom, panoramic mode|#|there are lots of features and settings to remember maybe a custom setting program would improve this, so you could set preferences for different occasions without having to remember or refer back to the manual
8.0|#|Loads of features, some of them very clever, such as auto panorama, smile detector, multi-shot approach to clarifying photos in low light.  Big zoom with auto steady.  Well made.|#|Photo sharpness below expectations, not much better than previous cheaper and lower spec cameras.  Nice feel and shape for taking photos, but makes it awkward to pack away - needs much more space than you'd imagine.
9.0|#|Great features especially the panorama mode|#|A good idea would be a simple, small one page quick guide - if thats possible
7.0|#|The features are good and the ease of use show a lot of thought has gone into to this product.|#|The images are staggeringly disappointing. Very grainy. I was surprised at this. Although there may be more detail, i achieve more satisfying images from the old Sony W7. I am thinking of selling this camera.

9.0|#|The camera is fairly easy to use once you have played with it a bit and overall the pictures I have got have been excellent. The sweep panoram is excellent and the shake reduction tool is very useful.

9.0|#|The good points about this camera are mainly its features, it has everything you want in a camera. Smile recognition, panoramic settings, hd movie etc. Not only this but the camera automatically senses its environment eg whether its nightime, landscape etc and instantly changes if you move your camera-saving you lots of time finding the right one.|#|Finally the last bad point is the strap, its not adjustable to fit around your wrist- thus making it pretty useless. The last thing you want to do is drop your camera! Thus having to pay more money for a new one.

10.0|#|This camera was recommended to me by a friend - it is so easy to use with great features and produces excellent pictures. The panoramic shots are great and it is so easy to edit pictures taken (something that was complicated with my previous camera).|#|No bad points!
8.0|#|Sweep panoramic, wide angle lens, and automatic intelligent photo features.|#|Not sure it is as good as my very old fuji in terms of coping with high contrast scenes. Also I wanted a viewfinder in this style of camera - could not find one from any manufacturer - so bought DSCH55S because of lens wide angle and sweep panoramic feature - however LCD screen is useless in sunlight as are those from all manufacturers.
9.0|#|This is an excellent quick shot camera, It is easy to use, has excellent telephoto range for its size and gives excellent picture quality. It is a compact size so you can take it anywhere If you shop around you can find some excellent deals which make this a vey good value camera..|#|I do miss not having an eye view capability. Having to use the screen to compose a picture, especially in bright sun light is not ideal.

8.0|#|The camera makes excellent videos (720p) - Such good quality in fact are the sound and video that my friends thought my videos from a recent Bon Jovi gig had been filmed by a television camera rather than from my own digital camera.|#|With this aside, the camera itself is brilliant and i don't regret the purchase at all, but think about case solutions before you buy unlike me.

Since I started using it my photographic experience has been transformed.  I am now building up my own 'clipart'... nature, flowers, birds, faces, sunsets, etc.  Having subscribed to 2 digital photography courses has pushes me to buy one.  Now I have let loose of my artistic nature.  On my computer I manipulate photos using features such as cloning,  removal of background and special effects before printing.|#|The SDHC cards from the same brand as my product should not be much dearer than the common brand.

9.0|#|Pocketable, powerful zoom. Image stabilisation, even when shooting video on the move. Good colour balance, sharp images. Also takes sdhc cards. Quick start, quick autofocus. Enough manual settings for keen amateur. Light weight. Videos make very acceptable dvd's. Very low zoom noise in video mode. Acceptable edge definition.Good battery life. Good value|#|Flimsy batery/card cover. Panorama shots not as good as HX5, but ok-ish. Low light performace could be better - much noise. Flash could be punchier, but remains acceptable for small rooms.
8.0|#|Easy to use, with plenty of feautres (including sweep-panorama and HD video recording).|#|To charge, the battery has to be removed from the camera. Surely it should be possible to charge to directly from the camera? Mobile phones have been doing that for years!

9.0|#|function saves me endless hours stitching images together in photoshop.|#|None that I've found yet! My only grumble seems to be limited f-number depth of field (but I haven't had a chance to fully test the sharpness compared to my SLR's). On the early images that I've downloaded the sharpness seems very good, but I won't really know until I've taken some images in the country side.

8.0|#|Excellent image quality , good selection of features , good battery life|#|
10.0|#|The camera sits comfortably in the hand and has a fantastic range from wide to telephoto. Makes taking pictures of buildings etc very easy. Close ups are easy too with the camera automatically switching to Macro without the need to preset the function. The multi sampling of the picture gives good accurate focus and exposure. Uploading to a computer (a Mac in my case) is very easy and the camera is fully Mac friendly unlike many others. Excellent value for money - very highly recommended.|#|No real bad points, a viewfinder would be an asset but would reduce the available space for the very nice large screen. A screen protector film as standard would be good too.
9.0|#|editing or transfer to dvd best with excellant MC 5. very good image stability|#|auto focus slow
10.0|#|Size and ease of operation are excellent. I have not given image quality a 10, but I have not had the camera for very long and my technique and choice of program will no doubt improve with use. The programs are excellent. I took the camera to New York recently and obtained excellent images in differents situations such as at night in Times Square, from the top of the Empire State Building, from boats, and details of buildings using the telephoto lens. Although it appears from comparisons that there are similar cameras on the market which may be cheaper, I am a Sony fan and have had Sony cameras for over 30 years.|#|
9.0|#||#|no bad points
9.0|#|image quality is fantastic when zoomed right the way in to ten|#|the battery life could be a little bit better
8.0|#||#|The one thing missing on this camera is a viewfinder.  It is impossible to take photos on a bright sunny day using the screen.
9.0|#|I'm generally very pleased with the camera.|#|The very fiddly, very small recessed on/off and view/review buttons, plus the unclear icons around the small OK button,  are not easily/quicly accessible and slow use of the camera and are very irritating. The hatch to the battery compartment feels somewhat flimsy. And the choice of mode on the top easily slips out of place.

7.0|#|High quality photos and lots of options.|#|Seems to be very slow when taking pictures. Shutter seems to be very slow when trying to take several pictures. Have tried different SD cards but still takes seconds between the photos. A lot slower than my previous Casio camera.
10.0|#|I do like the advanced scene recognition feature. I think it is  a terrific camera for the size my only complaint is shown below.|#|Find zoomig in on a picture to trim (resize) very jumpy, doesn't move slowly thro' the enlarging process.

8.0|#|For a point and press I still enjoy the manual control element available, as well as the impecable face smile recognition facility.... best of both worlds away from the DSLR's|#|The time to store a pic and prepare for the next frame in single frame mode.... I have an Extreme III card and it still struggles....  I have looked to turn the preview after picture taken off but it must be hidden away somewhere or unavailable....
9.0|#||#|the only problem i have found with the product is that the dial on the top right hand side which changes settings is to easily accidentially changed if you inadvertantly catch it with your thumb or finger. I now have to check that it is on the setting I want every time I have used it for a while.
8.0|#|Plenty of information on screen if wanted.|#|Would like WIFI file transfer and media server built in.

9.0|#|Ease of use.  Ability to use programmed settings and still 'play around' to to have manual settings.  10x zoom + 14mPixels enables passable photos of tiny or distant objects using spot focus and exposure.  eg the moon!|#|Battery life is poor.
8.0|#|Such features as the transparent mirror allows to see live what the effect of altering white balance, in low lighting this is a real bonus. The high ISO (12800), 10 frame per second rate, easy access menus add up to a very competent camera. Also the 350 dpi in JPEG @ 16.2 mega pixels gives you good crisp results. For anyone not able to afford a full frame camera, this is good stop gap.|#|The HD video is useless, the sensor overheats after about 5 minutes, leaving you to twiddle your thumbs until it's cool enough to use again. I tried fast memory cards but this didn't help. This is a real shame as the picture quality from video is very good. If I'd known I would have gone for the cheaper A33 instead.
10.0|#|Lightweight, easy to use. Very fast shooting which is great for action shots.|#|Shame that you have to have an electronic viewfinder, but that's the price of the semi-translucent mirror. The STM also reduces the amount of light entering the camera, so a faster lens is ideal if you want to shoot hand-held using available light.
10.0|#|. The screen is fantastic, it can be seen from any angle and in daylight and its big! I went for the panorama, thats what sold it because I had been wondering whether to go for the NEX5 or the DSLR then hey presto the panorama was included in the new 55. The merging bracketed images will a great help I hope especially for stained glass windows in gloomy churches, but I have still to learn this technique. The driving reason initially to was to get back to using my old Dynax Minolta lenses from my 300xi and to have stabilisation in the camera  so stabilised images could be abtained with anyof my lenses.|#|
7.0|#|Nice eye level view finder. Good that the back screen pivots. Nice colour rendition.|#|the screen (eye level or back screen!)  will be blank if the ambient light in the studio or outside is less than what you have set the manual settings at. Eg. inside a room (studio) you set the camera at say f8 and 1/100sec at ISO 100 you wont see a thing!!
10.0|#|The swivelling live viewer is also very good.|#|The darkening of the viewer when using manual makes it difficult to take macro shots. I know that I can set the finder to manual but the delay can allow the camera to go out of focus. I take many macro shots handheld rather than from a fixed point.. I use two flashes set at 45 degrees form left and right. If I use the flash contacts on the camera the camera flash will not open to give me a lighter view.
9.0|#|bought this camera in Dec. 2010----this is a very easy camera to use----the optical viewfinder was, actually, much better than I thought......there is a setting, preset, which gives you multiple picture taking ability....the burst(10 pictures/second) on fast moving subject matter was great............a very versatile camera but that above average photographer who wants to 'tweak' his photos.  I would highly recommend this camera.|#|not any that i can think of at this time.
9.0|#|compact, light weight, feels good in the hand - controls and menus well designed - artificial horizon very useful - folding LCD panel a must have for me - accepts my old minolta lenses with no problems -dust guard aspect of the mirror - quite happy with the EVF, preferable to the bulkiness of DSLRs - DOF preview - one touch video button.|#|No eye relief for spectacle wearers. Should be easy with an EVF surely?  Not supplying lens hood, remote control and LCD protective film does Sony no credit at all. It is cheap and merely drives purchasers to buy them from other, much cheaper, sources.  Battery price horrendous!!
9.0|#|gauge soon becomes invaluable.|#|Battery life is very poor. I cannot understand why Sony chose to use this small battery in a very power hungry camera. The larger one in the a580 does a 1000 shots whereas this one  does only about a quarter of that. You will definately need at least one spare battery.
10.0|#|Both the panorama facility and the hand-held twilight facility are really useful. They both seem more advanced than similar settings on the otherwise innovative Fuji HS10 bridge camera.|#|Not possible to use either the 2 second delay or the remote control (with separate controller), when the camera is set to HDR. Since HDR should ideally only be used when the camera is on a tripod this is a nonsense.
9.0|#|I love this camera.  I am not a technophile so I was VERY happy to be able to just pick this camera up and start using it.  Everything is very intuitive - from the SCN modes to controlling how long the shutter stays open in manual mode - this camera can be used from the get-go with no instructions or time spent trying to figure it out.  The sweep panorama mode is extremely cool although it takes a bit of playing with to get what you want some times.  The camera boots up and takes pictures extremely quickly, making it easy to get your shot on the fly.  The sport modes, 10-frame per second modes, twilight, etc all work extremely well.  I am very, very happy with this camera.  I team it up with the Sony SAL 18-250 but Tamron is coming out with an 18-270 that is highly recommended if you can wait for it.|#|It says the lense is whisper quiet when recording video but I did not find that to be the case.  The lense routinely makes very loud noises as it focuses.  The 10-frame per second, twilight, sweep panorama modes can eat thru the battery so quickly you'll be surprised.  Be prepared with spare batteries if using any of these modes extensively.  The auto focus on the camera is very good for most shots but can interfer and be difficult when trying to get specific things either in or out of focus, forcing you to switch to manual mode.  Then manual mode will sometimes refuse to snap the shot because the camera thinks you're too close to the object or it's not correctly in focus.  It can be pretty annoying sometimes but some patience will see you thru.

9.0|#|Small and light physically, excellent multi angle rear screen, GPS tagging, excellent magnify feature in both viewfinder and rear screen to get accurate manual focus.  Good auto focus system.  HD video has full time phase detect auto focus due to translucent mirror so no more focus hunting back and forth as other DSLRs do. Depth of field preview button is very useful.  Can capture shots at 10 frames per second at the full 16.2 megapixel resolution, this is 4 times quicker than my old DSLR.|#|Poor battery life, need to carry a spare to complete a full days shooting (300-400 pictures).  The Image sensor can produce purple fringing in high contrast areas (e.g black and white boundaries) when using cheaper lenses at wide apetures.  Not too much to worry about though as all digital cameras suffer from this to one extent or another and it can be fixed in post processing.  After shooting a burst of images, it can take some time to save them all to the SD card; a faster card would obviously help here.

8.0|#|The price is very competitive compered to similarly spect camera brands as with other aspects of the camera like features, build quality, image quality and weight. Battery life is excellent. The tilting LCD is fantastic, very clear and sharp. Super and easy to use menu system.|#|Lack of control for video shooting.  Lack of useful firmware updates that reflect what paying customers actually want and comment about on Sony's forum, but seem to just get ignored. Lack of the ability to control the camera via PC USB like you can with older Alpha models (real let down that this feature was left out on both A33 and A55).  Lack of manual control when shooting in panoramic mode eg, HDR. No battery grip available for A33 or A55, as of yet.

10.0|#|very good value i spent alot of time choosing my 1st dslr and this was a very good buy  for me can't stop taking pictures and i am trying all of the different settings|#|non yet
8.0|#|Big, clear and bright screen onback of camera. The tilt facility is invaluable. The advice menu is a great feature as it reminds one of each function as you come to use it, particularly valuable with the different pre-set programming modes. All the controls operate with a pleasing precision and the whole unit is easy to handle and not too bulky or heavy.|#|The on/off collar around the shutter button is a bit too close to the knurled function wheel on the front face and it is consequently too easy to turn off the camera when fumbling for that control. Better to resite the on/off collar around the less frequently used mode selector on the other side of the top surface. That is the only cricism that I jhave of this camera and the lenses in the kit.
9.0|#|Great image quality, simple menu, good quality lenses.|#|Software is moody at best.

8.0|#|4. Lenses focus better and if not have the ability to adjust them|#|I know I've listed a lot of negative points, but none of the above are major issues and I'm glad I purchased the A850 and went full frame.
9.0|#|It feels good to hold and all buttons are easy to reach. The Intelligent preview is brilliant and easy to operate with the left hand little finger whilst holding the lens and adjustments can be made to the image then shoot with the new settings.  I found this particularly useful.  All information from the back screen and viewfinder are clear and easy to read once you understand what the symbols mean. It's great value for money and such a close specification to the A900 that it was an easy decision to buy. I can't fault it.|#|none
10.0|#|Good weight balance. Easy lens change. Solid robust body.|#|Complicated instructions re functions in Manual.
10.0|#|Easy to hold and the common function buttons easy to find. A very robust construction, weatherproof and not too heavy.. Takes a wonderful picture with all those pixels.|#|As far as I am concerned, as a keen amateur, still learning, this camera has no bad points although I might qualify this in saying that until you get very familiar it some of the button controls need searching for.  A snooty pro could say that it lacks an extra facility of some sort or that frames per second could be faster.
10.0|#|Full frame, no-frills and easy-to-use.  The build quality is excellent and the images captured first rate.  When I bought this I got a superb camera and did not pay for features such as video and other gimmicks which I do not require.|#|Nothing thus far.

9.0|#|Nice sturdy small camera. Good for all types of general  photography. Easily carried around in your pocket.|#|Poor design of the battery door, very weak plastic. Mine is still in one piece and useable, but cracked across the middle. I have a good second hand one ready for when it gives up.

7.0|#|Informative display|#|No compatible remote shutter release...  No way to use bulb mode without physically keeping the shutter pressed, which causes camera shake
8.0|#|very pleased with my buy the camera weighs very little as you always end up carrying it the weight is a factor  simple to set up only takes a few seconds to change and toggle between shots very compact unlike a 35mm slr which is big and bulky.|#|only one bad point and that is the optical screen on the back where you review your photo after taking it and you cannot see the photo on the screen before taking the photo therefore with hind sight I would have purchased the 350y which has a preview set up where you can view the shot before taking the photo.

8.0|#|I like the small size and yet a large screen that is reasonably visible outdoors.|#|The flash produces very strong shadows if there are light surfaces behind the subject. This is much more pronounced than in my previous cameras and really detracts from some pictures.
10.0|#|Brilliant is all i can say. Yes its not as chunky as the SLR's and it doesn't have changeable lenses but as a digital camera its the best i have used to date. The features are fantastic, build quality is excellent, made by Sony who are known for their excellent cybershot camera's. All this in a sleek looking housing. Yes it is pricey for some people but looking at the features it packs inside, its worth the money i don't regret the purchase at all. Thumbs up from me :)|#|Doesn't have any, that how good it is :)

8.0|#|Solidly built|#|Too easy to obscure lens with finger tip when shooting
9.0|#|) is a nice gadget, once you have got from Sony the appropriate base - but its other advatnages include a rapid shutter that makes photographing mobile young children easier than with other cameras; and its slim size is very convenient for keeping in your pocket at all times.|#|

9.0|#|For the price, you get great quality images and 2 great lenses. A fantastic camera that's easy to carry around. As a wedding photographer, I can get a little tired of lugging large cameras and equipment around. The NEX-f3 allows me to get great images when out with my family very easily.|#|The only niggle I have is the lack of view finder, but that isn't too important. I could buy one (£200 ish) if I really wanted to.

10.0|#|Looks great. Simple to operate so far. I bought a kit with 16 mm and 18-55 mm lenses, which should suit very well. Also included was the flash (not included in all kits). Selling point for me was good low-light performance due to the large sensor.|#|Nothing comes to mind.

I have owned canon and minolta(sony) before.The lens can be a bit pricey but I think that applies to all manufacturers. Light weight and quite easy to get used too. Lens changing is quite easy.If you want a more proffessional camera you can go up the range . This camera is more than adequate for my needs.|#|cost of lenses

10.0|#|I am a Sony fan this is the third camera I have had it is my first DSLR I tested a few others by canon and nikon and when I tried the A700 it felt comfortable I am still getting used to it but it is easy to use and you can make things simple or complex with good results|#|I am not a photographer so do not have a lot of knowledge to test this against but I havent found a bad side to it yet except when I take a bad shot I have so far found it is down to the way I have used the camera
10.0|#||#|Would have liked a cd instruction manual to place on to may laptop
9.0|#|Solidly built and taking a bit of a bashing already. It's on the heavy side but that is to be expected for a higher end camera. Was a little sceptical prior to purchasing due to its branding but they seem to have built well onto there predessesors foundations and have produced a great camera. Good battery life, exceptional LCD display (not live view but who needs that). This is a brief review but I am so very happy, I am definitely an enthusiastic amature and I felt this camera for the price with awesome lens kit (worth about 2/3 of the total price paid) was well worth it, great quality camera at a fraction of the cost of the 50D (both of these are most likelyt better cameras but I don't quite need that quality - although I think this kicks the D90's ass or at least is very much on a par but again better build (magnesium alloy body) and cheaper! As with all camera's shop around, play as much as you can and see what you like. This was an ugly duckling but was just so much easier to use and far less fiddly than the 500D and D90 that were the othrs I was looking at (also cheaper and to my mind better...although many will disagree very strongly). Head onto dooyoo for mor extensive good reviews or google the camera for a more formalised comparison (it stood up well to comparisons with the 50D).|#|Some say limited range of lenses but for me the range of lenses available is excellent and older lenses with Alpha fit lens will work well. As it's an older camera there is no HD film capability but I'm not intending on becoming Ridley Scott so I do not care!

9.0|#|The optical vewfinder is one of the main points I looked for when buying a camera.  It allows good pictures to be taken on sunny days.  I used it for a friends wedding, The Sony was the only camera with this feature, all my pictures were good, others had to  use the screen and guess!|#|A storeage pocket for the Card adapter in the carry case would also be an advantage, as when trying to download the pictures the adapter is needed and is  never to hand.

10.0|#|This is a brilliant camera and its so easy to use and I like the ease of finding and understanding the instructions. Picture quality excellent.|#|Only one very tiny criticism i would have liked the lens cap to be attached to camera and not loose, as easy to mislay it.

9.0|#|What I like about this product is that it's light, compact and the build quality feels good. It has everytying you need to take great pictures in pretty much every situation and as well as the pure photography options to get off 'auto' and create some amazing effects, you also have those fun gadgets that usually come with a compant which are great to play with. Often, it's one or the other so I like the versatility. Also love the fast shooting on the continous setting.|#|I would like a setting for continuous shooting which just makes it happen regardless of previous settings. Often when something is going on which needs the rapid 7 shots per second.....I apply that setting....but it won't work if you're previous flash settings are 'on'. So you have to stop and go into the flash setting, switch that off and then start shooting...by which time whatever you wanted is over! It's a small thing but have missed some action as a result.

9.0|#|Can take some fantastic photos without me needing to know about setting up the perfect shot (e.g. low f number to blur background when taking a portrait). Sensor size is great to allow low light shooting, HDR works well, and the ability to take 6 shots to reduce noise is useful.|#|Cannot change between modes when turned off like the Nex 6 and most other compact cameras, so if you need to take a quick shot you have to hope its in the best mode (or remember to turn it on to auto before turning off). The camera can have a problem focussing sometimes, and refuses to focus certain shots unless directed elsewhere to focus there, and then back again onto the original item, again, this can be annoying. Finally, i think i found a way to keep the 3 separate HDR photos to edit yourself later, but can't find it again!

9.0|#|All in all I would recommend it.|#|The only bad points about it is that the setting button on top of the camera is easily changed and a brush of your hands could have you taking pictures in a different setting without you even noticing it.

9.0|#|THIS IS MY FIRST DSLR CAMERA. IT IS VERY SIMPLE TO USE ONCE YOU HAVE READ THE SIMPLE EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS GUIDE. I CANT PUT THE CAMERA DOWN AT THE MOMENT I'M SNAPPING HAPPILY ALL DAY.|#|THERE ARE NO REAL BAD POINTS TO TALK ABOUT. THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE NECK STRAP COULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE, MAYBE PADDED.
9.0|#|Very good beginner camera|#|Not long before you want more advanced features
10.0|#|Ease of use.|#|None.
9.0|#|Easy to get started with. the 2 lens kit gives you the flexibility to cover a wide range of photography. Even with the long lens on the setup is not too heavy or unwieldy. Image quality is good and the steady shot feature brings benefit, especially when taking in lowish light on the long lens.|#|Kit lens have a relatively high f stop, choice of after market lens's is less than for other leading brands. This model lacks Live view and mirror lock up facility.
10.0|#|finish are excellent.|#|

9.0|#|Terrific value for money. Better than anything Canon or Nikon can provide for the price tag and comes with two lenses! The picture quality is fantastic in all lighting and incredibly easy to use. Good for new photographers that may be a little intimidated by the amount of models on the market.|#|
7.0|#|Comprehensive features. Can use 2 different flash cards at same time. Image stabilisation in camera so not needed in each lens.|#|Only 1 rear lens cap for 2 lenses. AC adaptor should be included, else all operations undertaken under battery power (eg camera settings, reviewing images, downloading photos, etc). No mechanical remote shutter release facility in shutter button.
8.0|#|Ease of finding the settings; the screen being able to move and the clarity of it.  The grip (made by the company involved) improves the handling greatly!|#|Doesn't feel 'solid' in my hand (so to speak)
9.0|#|The image quality. The ease of use.|#|Tamron lens can stick when taken to 300mm, but I have been told this is ok. The auto focus can sometimes be awkward to use. And the 18 - 55mm sony lens can sometimes lead to over exposure so watch the controles.
9.0|#|Easy to use camera and easy to read instruction manual, it must be easy I can use it|#|Havent found any as yet, one down side no video option which is no great loss as you concentrate more on photography.
8.0|#|Very simple to get up and running with.|#|Not as intuitive to use once you stray away from fully automatic as i would have liked.
8.0|#|A nice and easy camera as a move from SLR to DLSR|#|Instruction manual is a bit basic - have had to buy some additional manuals
10.0|#|Good price and a good first introduction to a digital SLR. I had an old SLR and was keen to get into SLR again.|#|

9.0|#|It's brilliant, pocket sized, has a zoom function, fill in flash, all the benefits of an SLR without the hassle. It has a long battery life so you can take loads of pictures at a high resolution, and it has an autofocus so, even wearing glasses, I get great pictures. It's made by Sony so, it's practically bullet proof.  The technology is second to none and it doesn't go wrong. It also takes moving pictures  with sound so, a really good all round tool.|#|The only downside is, because it's compact, the controls are small, particularly the on/off button but, operationally, it's so simple to use.



10.0|#|Quality of pictures|#|Position of pop-up flash means it can sometimes be obstructed by a finger


10.0|#|It is what i expect from s.....|#|No at  the moment.
9.0|#|easy to use, very good picture and you can get lots of accessory's such as wide angle and zoom lenses|#|its hard to fined a replacement memory card of any decent size
9.0|#|good for over the head shots|#|quite bulky ,and heavy
9.0|#|Whilst this is the only digital camera I have owned,so I've nothing to compare it with, I have been very happy with its  performance. Maybe extra pixels would improve on an already good picture quality, I cannot say - but it gets high marks from me.|#|Not being an expert photographer - It suits me fine. I can't come up with any faults.
9.0|#|I would definitely recommend it's purchase to a friend, and have in fact done so on several occassions.|#|There must be some bad points, but in spite of being used almost every day, I've not found them yet.
7.0|#|Small, compact and easy to use|#|Charging pack/unit is not USB and too large.
8.0|#|I am a Minolta-fun and I have had 3 Minoltas: A5, SR-1 and X-700. Sony Alpha is using Minoltas bayonet so Minoltas AF-lenses are stil in use.|#|Only 10 Megapixels.  Today this is not enough.
9.0|#|Lens changing is also quick. Manual setting is good.|#|could do with live view on lcd screen.
9.0|#|Image stabilisation inside camera body works very well|#|
8.0|#|it is a good quality camera, easy to use and has all the features that most non-professionals would look for in a camera in this price range.|#|The cost of peripherals (i.e. additional lenses, etc) is quite high.
