9.0|#|Generally easy to use, but still learning the different functions. Picture quality is superb.|#|I bought it to cover both stills photography and videography. The pop-out screen is fine, but in strong light it is difficult to see the moving image, and you cannot use the viewfinder as an alternative. Otherwise very good quality results.
8.0|#|Very easy to make adjustments without the need to go through loads of menus. Very easy to use, packed full of features and good screen. touch screen comes in useful, didn't think it would, but I like it.|#|Body feels cheap and light plastic, although there is a coating that helps with grip, the camera feels light and fragile, probably is tougher than it feels. I wouldn't take this out without it being bagged up most of the time.

10.0|#|Fantastic camera for the price :-) was the best deal on line :-) came with an additional battery, which is the only company to supply this offer. Was also the bonus of the £50 cash back through Canon :-) would thoroughly recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying a Canon and doesn't know what model to buy and where from :-) superb all round camera ;-) so much still to learn and mastering the camera is something of a challenge but one I'm looking forward to completing to be able to get the ultimate best from this truely superb camera :-) previous owner of Canon camera but never believed I would own a 700D :-)) one very lucky happy girl|#|

10.0|#|I imagine even if you had no experience with DSLRs! I love the FPS - bought it for a weekend at a dark (or artificially lit) exhibition with lots of moving subjects, and it took some superb photos|#|
9.0|#|If you take many family or other portraits, save up for a 430 EX II flash which is an excellent match with this camera.  Bounce flash gives great results.|#|Only annoying thing when working in theatres under difficult lighting conditions is the limited exposure lock feature.  The * button is OK but fiddly and it should be possible to lock it with the shutter half pressed in all modes, not just 'evaluative' metering.
9.0|#|Overall a very good camera, excellent image quality for enter level DSLR camera|#|It came without serial numbers which is very strange
8.0|#|screen display of all operations|#|none found so far but I have only had the camera for 1 week
8.0|#|The image quality is amazing! And I love how lightweight it is. Carrying it around feels effortless. Perfect for long shooting days that involve going to different locations.|#|It shoots for around 4 hours non-stop, which is actually really good in comparison but something to keep in mind. And also, it has a 'self-close' feature when its not being used for a bit, which does get quite irritating, and right now there doesn't seem to be an easy way of removing that

9.0|#|The quality of the image is very good. I was surprised at the improvement compared to my 450D. It is well balanced and I love the fold-out screen. Ideal as much of my photography is done one-handed.|#|It feels light and very plastic. This makes me feel a little apprehensive when holding it. I'd prefer a more solid feel. Maybe an aluminium body or something more substantial. A minor detail. I'm sure I'll get used to it.

9.0|#|Easy to use, touch screen is great, takes very good photos, feels light in the hand.|#|It feels cheep and the 18-55 lens feels so plastic, got the sigma 70-300 lens and it struggles all the time to find focus if you can afford it go for the canon.

8.0|#|A very nice high end beginners camera, nice crisp images. Added with a 50mm prime lens and maybe a 18 to 135mm zoom to get the action closer.|#|Slightly over priced, but then again it is a Canon. Needs a UV filter to protect the optics.
9.0|#|Good picture quality with the STM lens. Much better lens as standard compared to my old 450d|#|Still feel video mode despite using a fast SDHC card a bit jerky frame rate. Trying different settings so hopefully get it right. Maybe best not to pan too much

10.0|#|photography. It's ideal for zooming in on birds in the garden or doing close up portrait shots but I would recommend that if you are a first time buyer like myself to buy a EF- S 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS Lens STM. I have had to order this lens on top of the zoom lens. I will get plenty of use out of the zoom lens but maybe wasn't needed just yet :-) but over all like I said, I am still just learning how to use a full DLSR so it's very much trial and error for me as far as lenses go. I would also recommend buying a spare battery as I used a full battery up in just half a day :-) On a slightly different note, the instruction booklet that comes with the product is also very informative and clear to understand. The camera is very well built, quite heavy, but sturdy and easy to hold and the larger view finder is very easy to look through during live view. I'm only just getting to know the camera but am in love with it already :-) :-) I would most definitely recommend it :-) :-)|#|It's a shame that Canon could not have included a lens hood with the lens that I bought. For the amount that the lens alone cost, a lens hood would not have broken their bank I'm sure.
10.0|#|a great camera, a definite semi pro product. The best APC camera I have used and a real step up from the 70d in most areas. Better than my 5Diii for video.|#|I would rather have wifi ( so I can remote it from a phone/laptop) than GPS ( I usually know where I am)  and it really needs moveable screen ( such as on the 70d)
10.0|#|Finally! I can use my x 1.4 convertor with autofocus attached to my 100 - 400mm lens.|#|
10.0|#|Excellent speed of focus,even on moving objects.Video also very easy to use with quick change between camera and video recording.Manages well in low light.Excellent images...very sharp even when subject is moving.Camera is able to track movement and with 10 frames per second this camera can shoot action shots easily.|#|

10.0|#|As the owner of an original 7D , I wondered if the 7D mk2 could be as good as some of the reviews. Well after using it for the first time taking some action shots all I can say is I'm blown away by the cameras performance even in less than ideal lighting conditions. Lots more to discover yet , but Canon have again made a fantastic semi pro DSLR.|#|No

9.0|#|Good points have to include 10fps and focusing speed, perfect for action photography.|#|Nothing bad so far in the first month of use other than a tiny amount of digital noise at the high end of the ISO range, but this is to be expected with any camera and is easily overcome using software.

Image quality up to iso 400.|#|Image quality only sightly better than the 7d from iso 400 to 800. Noise becomes an issue for me above iso 800.Heavy on batteries, so carry a couple of spares and having to use the main dial to magnify images when viewing on camera. I much prefer pressing the button on the 7d.

10.0|#|Fast, precise AF, excellent VF coverage, 10fps. Auto focus at f8. Better at high sensitivities than expected, fully implemented auto-ISO, high iso noise is easier to deal with than it was with the 7D. Can share batteries with 7D/5DIII, feels very well built. Very similar to 5DIII in use. Extra reach with long lenses.|#|Battery life is a small step backward, overall image quality is significantly improved over the 7D but still inferior to full frame cameras. Not quite as much extra reach with long lenses as 1.6 crop factor would suggest and no advantage over FF in this respect above 1600ISO.
9.0|#|This is a great camera for if you want something a bit more high spec than your standard compact, but aren't yet of a level to get the best out of a big DSLR.|#|As you'll see from the spec, it comes with quite a few separate accessories (lens caps and things), so I would strongly recommend buying yourself a camera bag to keep everything together.
9.0|#|this does me quite well. I like the size and flexibility of having a virtual DSLR on me at all times without the need to be carrying my usual full frame DSLR with me when I am not out to specifically take photos. I chose this Canon CSC as opposed to other brands as I already use Canon EF lenses.  So far with the latest firmware on board I have noticed none of the focussing issues that dogged the early release models of this camera.|#|Battery life is a little limited but the acquisition of a second battery has solved that problem.
10.0|#|Amazing build quality, great compact size yet still packed with features. Reports of a terrible auto focus are unfounded it might not be best in class but its more than acceptable.|#|None

10.0|#|I love the size of the camera, it has all the features of my DSLR but none of the weight. Touch screen  feature is great but not essential!|#|Although the touch screen is great, I would swap it for a view finder for in bright light
8.0|#|Pro image quality|#|No in camera RAW development
8.0|#||#|Should be sold with Lens adapter included as there are currently only 3 lens available.
9.0|#|Same image sensor as the mid range EOS lineup (600D etc), same interface, (but with touchscreen), great size, looks beautiful, good weight.|#|No viewfinder (because its mirror less, the screen is impossible to see in the sun), adapter needed (at a hefty £100) to attach standard canon lenses. NO TETHERED SHOOTING!? This one actually almost take it back. All other EOS cameras can, why can't this one?
8.0|#|Quality build. Even with the 18-55mm lens it can still fit in a jacket pocket. With no viewfinder you get used to it. A smart little camera that packs a punch!|#|Still looking for some!
9.0|#|Value for money.|#|no viewfinder.
9.0|#|Well built, easy to use. Can use all my EOS lenses using the adapter.|#|A optical view finder sometimes can be useful especially in bright sunlight.
8.0|#|Quality product at a great price.  Got a package deal which was very good.|#|
9.0|#|The flash is removable so during the day theres no need to carry it with you. The quality of the screen is great and takes professional looking photos without the need for a huge dslr.|#|It's fairly heavy
7.0|#|Small and compact, good back up camera as you can use your large L series lens (with a special converting ring).|#|
9.0|#||#|No ability to use wireless or USB remote (IR only via front facing sensor which is restrictive for 360 degree panorama boom work using 8mm fisheye).  Maybe this can be fixed in the firmware?

9.0|#|Easy access to main features the sliding screen is very useful and makes altering the settings easier to use.  Fairly light weight to handle does the job that I needed it for.|#|The technical jargon for the various uses is sometimes difficult to understand but on the whole a great camera.
9.0|#|love it!|#|none really
10.0|#|Great picture quality.  Extremely easy to use.|#|This is a great camera, the only bad point is that focusing can be a bit slow especially in low light.
10.0|#|As a professional photographer I never thought I would get such superb quality from a point and shoot little camera. So much easier than the top of the range cameras I use on a daily basis. I just whip the Sureshot out, press on and go. Given me so much pleasure and I've only had it 2 weeks!!!|#|None
10.0|#|This camera is an excellent choice for a second camera when its not convenient to carry a full frame SLR camera with you.  Sturdy construction.  Nice to have optical viewfinder as live view is dreadful in bright sunshine.|#|Would have liked to have a manual included.

10.0|#|Great camera, user interface easy to understand, fantastic as a back up to my dslr|#|The only minor point is if you have large hands the camera is a tad small, but add on the thumb clip that is available it makes it easier to handle
9.0|#|Everything that a DSLR can do without the bulk and an exellent manual override too.|#|the lens could be slightly sharper and a 'real view' through the viewfinder
9.0|#|I haven't had much chance to play but stick it in auto and away you go.|#|Enormous amount in the on line manuals which can be a little overwhelming.
9.0|#|Solid feel and positive shutter response. Compact size so easy to carry around but image quality for a compact camera is excellent.|#|Possibly the lack of a tilting LCD screen though this hasn't caused me any isseues as yet.
7.0|#||#|Aperture correction and the program selector button on the too of the camera turn too easily.  Always have to check them When I take camera out of the case

10.0|#|Since receiving the camera I have not had much time to trial it but what little I have done I am very impressed with it. Pictures taken on auto are well exposed and colours balance, useful to be able to download images to my computer without the need for cables using WiFi. Build quality is very good and apart from the optical viewfinder which could have been bettered with frame marks to mark out the aspect ratios I am well satisfied.|#|Menu structure takes some time to understand.

9.0|#|Fairly compact will fit large pocket|#|connectivity with Smart phone seems not easy would be useful to control camera from smart phone
9.0|#|Like the controls so don't have to use active screen for menu.  Fully automatic but with option to use manual controls.

Image Quality is excellent, better than my 5DM3 (which is excellent), a lot better than my 7D. This is the best camera I have owned, I wish I had bought one when they first came out.  I use the camera to shoot kids football tournaments, which involves lots of action, group and individual shots; very often taken in testing weather conditions, changeable light from one direction to another, even clouds and shadows on the pitch.

8.0|#|We bought this camara to use underwater in the Maldives and it did what it says on the box|#|The only winge is that the on/off button is to close to the shutter button so without care you can turn the camara off instead of taking a photo
10.0|#|It's a very nice, sturdy, good looking camera.|#|Although the on/off, shutter and video buttons are well positioned and easy to use the others are a little fiddly.
10.0|#|Went down to 25m and it took excellent pictures the deeper the better the picture for the money you can not go wrong  I love this camera|#|No real bad points but you need lights so I'm going to buy some for my next trip just to lighten every thing up and show more colour but you can take really great pictures with out lights
7.0|#|Recommended once set to English!|#|Item delevered was Japanese market only, so all setting were in Japanese. Eventually found where to set language to English (second to last setting on 'tools icon'). Bingo no squigly lines just English, chuffed to bits.

8.0|#||#|It's quite pricey, and about worth it but if the cost is for the video features, it would have been a better camera if cheaper and just for stills. The wrist strap could do with a  'running' loop so you can tighten it around the wrist. It's so loose that it will easily slip off over your hand.

9.0|#|A very good piece of tech for the aspiring photographer which is well worth the money. Offers great quality pictures especially in low light environment (when upgrading from compact cameras) Some very awesome features which allow you to boost your creativity. The 18-135mm offers an adequate zoom for general purpose use. Overall a great DSLR I enjoy using.|#|None so far :)
10.0|#|Great DSLR camera  with a high quality lens worth the price. Easy to learn for a beginner with many advanced features.|#|Camera does not come with memory card
10.0|#|Comes with a super and high quality lens which is really worth for the price your paying. Plus the camera body features like the touchscreen display is suoer handy for fast focus points and to find various settings fast.|#|When shooting a video aand you zoom in. The lens is quite hard to zoom in and if you dont have a tripod you'll probably loose the stability  and stillness of the camera and ruin the video because your gonna shake a little but if you have image stabilization on it will help a lot in shooting a video without a tripod.

10.0|#|I have wanted to move up to a more sophisticated digital camera but am still a novice, I found this model ideal as it is easy to use with many functions to experiment with, would recommend to anyone wanting to become more experienced in photography.|#|With the lens I chose it was a little heavier than I thought it would be all together but I will adapt to it in time.
9.0|#|Great size weight and of course image quality|#|Have to remember to switch off the camera each time or the battery runs out and has done to me too many times.. previous cameras had auto off.

10.0|#|A very good all round dslr and good value for money, especially with the 18-135 is stm lens. I've been doing photography for 50 years and purchased my first Canon EOS slr (film, which I still have)) 15 years ago, the lenses and speedlite flash I have are compatible with the 700d. If you want 35mm full frame size like professionals use,   you'll have to pay a lot more money. The 700d is a good enthusiasts camera with good choice of modes so that beginners would have no problems using it. The 18-135 is stm lens is quiet with non rotating front element which is great when using polarizing filter, I'm very pleased with this camera and lens purchase and would recommend them.|#|None

10.0|#|Image quality very good|#|
10.0|#|Modern up to date camera while not forgetting what it's for..image quality excellent I had a real problem deciding between this camera and the nikon d7100 . Reviews tend to say nikon for proper photography and the 70d more for video. Well I looked into them till my head was spinning and I made the choice to go with the 70d based on the live view screen and the image quality not for how good it is shooting video witch seems to go against the recommended comparasons as I'm am into still photography..all I can say to help you is I am really happy with my choice the focusing is fantastic the kit lens 18-135 is also very good and the camera is very easy to use the menus are easy to use and set up the buttons on the camera are easy to reach and give quick accesses to the main changes that one would need. The live view fip screen is outstanding just like using a smart phone. The built in wifi was very easy to setup and use.|#|Bought the camera instead of some wallpaper and paint to decorate the house.....not gone down well
9.0|#|In built spirit level is a nice addition|#|Filter attachment ring is larger than that on the 450 so existing filters don't fit the supplied lens
10.0|#|This is an outstanding camera and the 18-135 lens is excellent. I have been amazed at the enormous difference between the 70D and my old 500D. The results at ISO 6400 are unbelievable! No noise at all. Highly recommended and saved over £400 buying online from a major high street retailer.|#|The only negative is that this is a camera for advanced photography. If you're a novice, this is not the camera for you. On the other hand, if you know your ISO, Fstops, and shutter speed, this is an amazing camera for the price!
8.0|#|Sturdy, convincing quality for the most part. An excellent choice for someone like me who is not a pro but have taken photos in earlier life with an analog camera. There are more features than I'm likely to use, which can, in a way, be taken as a good point (alas, the price effect).|#|At first, the number of physical controls and the features behind them  proved a bit perplexing. Shooting on manual at night was not self-evident on the first go, mostly in terms of focusing. The somewhat unmeshed dichotomy of conventional viewing and live viewing as well as the rather short battery life bring down the rating from 9 to 8.
9.0|#|Flip screen is great on and off a tripod. very very fast focus - brilliant|#|Plastic finish feels /looks cheap but works to provide a good surface to grip on
10.0|#|* Hot shoe mount for mounting external lamp, shot gun or stereo mic|#|* Having to ensure you set the right volume before recording video. Can't change this during recording
9.0|#|Many of the new features solve a number of difficulties using my EOS 450D camera.  Church interiors and landscapes with dull white skies will show detail in Stained glass and clouds.  Touch screen valuable for ease of focus on non centred subjects.  A major improvement, with trhe possibility of simple use for beginners, leading them to add extra skills as they need them.  Fantastic to be able to leave my camcorder at home.  I'm hoping to leave my backpack home next time we go on holiday, and just use the cameras and the kit lens.|#|NO real complaints, just a Bit heavier than my former camera, but that is to be expected, I purchased with the 18-135 mm kit lens, which is obviously also heavier than the 18-55, however the additional focal length is of major benefit with my animal and bird photos.

9.0|#|Great image quality, feels sturdy and not over heavy, perfect for wildlife with its 1.6 crop factor..|#|
9.0|#|I have only had the camera a couple of weeks and still trying to find my way round all the functions but can find nothing negative to comment on at this point. If possible I would have gone for the 5D but given the difference in price I think this is a great buy and value for money.|#|Have found nothing negative about the camera so far although I have yet to print from the SDHC memory card.

10.0|#|to find fault with anything, but the composition of an image is more important than needle-sharpness in most cases. But this outfit delivers everything you could reasonably expect!|#|Takes some time to learn the more remote features, but we'll worth the effort - everything you may want is there.
9.0|#|Tracking during filming|#|Not found any yet
9.0|#|Features which can only be followed|#|Dunno of any yet
10.0|#|Telephoto lens is superb.|#|Can be a bit tricky to hold without the neck strap attatched.
10.0|#|I already own a Canon EOS 600D, but have developed Rheumatoid Arthritis in the past year, which has made it difficult to hold or grip for prolonged periods. I bought the EOS 100D because it is smaller, lighter and potentially easier to use. This has proved to be the case and it is now the favoured camera; with the appropriate choice of lens, the balance is even better. The outfit came with a free spare battery and a free carry case - a great bargain.|#|There is nothing that I don't like. I do miss the versatility of the variable-angle viewing screen of the 600D, but there had to be compromises to achieve the weight-saving in the 100D, which is a very minor niggle and is the obvious way to achieve the lightness.
8.0|#|Touch screen is a nice little extra - definitely not necessary but some features are great, like scrolling/zooming images and quickly changing manual settings.|#|My little finger hangs off the bottom of the grip. At first I wasn't happy about this as the camera felt a bit insecure in my hand. But after using it a few times you get the feel for it.
10.0|#|which includes an EF 75-300mm lens. Which really makes for a fantastic value package.|#|Okay I can print it out, and I suppose I will, but I would happily pay for a decent manual or book!
10.0|#||#|Grey import, no serial number to register with Canon for warranty
10.0|#|You will notice a big difference moving from a compact. Fantastic Camera overall.|#|No articulated screen but would have been difficult to fit one on a camera of this size, but certainly not a deal breaker when considering purchase of this camera.
9.0|#|The touch-screen that activates taking a shot is so wonderful, it fits my idea of modern-day  photography.  I can make the lens focus on any point I wish, even if the subject is a small one.  It sort of creates a zone-focus field.|#|The lens focussing motor whirls when taking videos, I can hear it on the results.  It's not good at all.
10.0|#|The touch screen makes it easier to switch between pictures. If you aren't keen on manually setting the settings then the landscape, portrait, sport, etc is fantastic. With auto focus there's no need to fiddle with focusing on your subject.|#|It could do with a few more settings for stuff like sunrise/sunset and nature to give bright colours.
10.0|#|Excellent pictures even on the fully automatic mode, and simple to use.  Much more possible with experimentation with all the different modes and settings.|#|Battery life
9.0|#|exposure brillant|#|no  paper instruction manuel
9.0|#|Light so easy to carry|#|No Memory card included so unless you spot this you have a camera but cannot play with it straight away.
9.0|#|Easy to use, compact, great image quality|#|Expensive, but this was the best price/package I found
9.0|#|Bought it as a package with telephoto lens and really good camera bag, excellent value!|#|Nothing
9.0|#|Handy for easy photography but equally capable of more complex work.|#|Alost complete lack of hard-copy manuals, most on CD/DVD
9.0|#|Small, light and easy to use. As a novice, I already had pictures which look like they're straight out of a magazine on the first day.|#|
9.0|#|All in all, great value for money and solid enough build to weight ratio.|#|Small point, but the camera didn't come with a bog standard memory card. Luckily, I'd bought a new card at the same time but would have been disappointed if camera had arrived and had been unable to fully utilise due to this.
9.0|#|Finally much lighter then other models.|#|Not come across any bad points so far.
9.0|#|Love the ability to click click click without noticeable storage delay|#|Haven't found a bad point yet
10.0|#|An ideal starter kit for the budding photographer. We bought this for our 13 year old daughter and she has had hours of fun. Lots of great features. Worth buying a bigger lense to maximise it's full potential which we did. The lense cost as much as the camera. Worth it though as the results have been stunning!|#|This camera doesn't come with an SD card. We had to buy one separately. Bit annoying as would have expected this to be included.
10.0|#|Use on Auto for a start to help get the feel of the camera, then gradualy use other settings as you gain confidence. Images are very good, although when you first start experimenting different settings you may have some pics that are not perfect, but it takes time and practice.|#|
10.0|#|This was the best value for money bundle around !|#|None, product as expected.
10.0|#|Don't think that because it's cheap it won't perform well. This is an excellent camera.|#|Nearly fell out of my hand as it's quite a small camera so i bought a battery grip to make it easier to handle.
9.0|#|Super light and very portable - it fits into my handbag. really easy to use, cheaper lenses than Nikon, a great entry level DSLR.|#|No flip out screen and no wifi but this would affect the size of the camera
9.0|#|Good DSLR camera. Would recommend to anyone.|#|
9.0|#|This is my umpteenth Canon and 2nd DSLR. I suspect that like most people addicted to SLRs the key things for me are ease of composing your pictures and the power of the lenses. This is a beautiful camera and an amazingly quick and quiet lens. I may never use some of the more advanced features because I just like taking pictures and it does that with great simplicity. Image stabilization is also great on the new lenses, I also bought the 70-300 USM, awesome.|#|I haven't found any.
9.0|#|Size, frames per minute, ISO range and very easy to use. Amazing at this price.|#|The 18mm - 55mm lens supplied with body is limiting, suggest getting 55mm - 250mm lens at same time.
9.0|#|Lighter and more compact than other dSLR cameras without compromising picture options and quality.|#|Less buttons to directly access exposure options on the rear of the camera but they are easily selected through the excellent touch screen.
8.0|#|touch screen is fab|#|video guzzles batteries -  old camera battery lasted  months.  even with little video,  you'll need 2  batteries on the go for heavy use.
9.0|#|It feels nice and solid. I have wanted a DSLR camera for a long time and this one has not disappointed me.|#|None as yet.
9.0|#|As my first digital slr it is very good. The compact size means you do take it with you and it is then available to get those special shots a compact would struggle with.|#|In low light it can struggle to get any sort of depth of field but this a very minor point on an otherwise goid body and lens combination.

10.0|#|Everything|#|None
9.0|#|The camera is do light, still so full of features, that I wonder if I will remember all (that's a positive point too me) but it does not make it complex to use. Full automatic mode will give you the greatest pictures.|#|I was used to the GPS tags, taking pictures from my phone, but there is no such thing on the camera. It just means I need to document my pictures manually when I import them into my picture library.  There is an optional GPS device, but it's almost half the price of the camera body, and take as much space as an external flash light. Not such a big deal, but it would have been nice to have an integrated one.

9.0|#|It's early days, yet, to really extol its good points. The important thing - it's a camera that does what you expect it to do...give you pin sharp pictures, every time. I've yet to fully appreciate its different programmes. A 300mm telephoto lens came with my deal. I'm looking forward to getting good pics of birds at the nearest RSPB location.|#|
10.0|#|Enough information to help you along the way|#|

The lens it comes with is great for close and mid range shooting. Slightly heavy but you soon get used to the weight and well worth carrying it around on your neck for the photos it produces.|#|The manual was huge and required a computer to view. Would have liked a condensed quick start hard copy of the manual I could read to begin with whilst getting used to the camera. A way to register the product to your name that would benefit you if the camera was ever stolen would be a nice feature too.

10.0|#|So easy to use with great results. By far the best camera I have used|#|None
8.0|#|Good value deal - 2 lens and bag included.|#|Early days but no problems so far.
8.0|#|Fantastic support through app for phone. Easy to use for beginners good start point|#|Could do with a better sd card and a second battery
9.0|#|There are better cameras out there but at a much higher price I find the EOS 1200D easy to use and without having years of experience had great results straight from the beginning if you're coming up from a compact or a bridge camera then I would highly recommend the 1200D and there's a lot of help out there to make sure you get the best results.|#|To be honest I can't really think of any thing I don't like about this camera the battery life is much better than I thought it would be. I looked at other cameras before buying the 1200D and can honestly say I made the right choice.

10.0|#|Excellent Camera|#|
9.0|#|Being able to use my phone to control and view picures is excellent|#|
9.0|#||#|This camera is an upgrade for me. Previously owned an eos 5 and what a difference! The images are so bright, full of life and sharp. It took my rather longer to move away from the auto setting because it was so good though, having now done so, the on screen information is superb. Brilliant camera!
9.0|#|Very crisp clear pictures. Big improvement over eos 450d. Fantastic live view. Fast continuous shooting.|#|No bad points so far
8.0|#|I thought the button layout would be hard to get used too after using the 600d for a long time, however I was pleasantly mistaken an it is a joy to use.|#|No intervalmeter and wish magic lantern was released for it.
10.0|#|Touch screen functionality, wifi with free iPhone app, intuative design and menus (for existing Canon EOS users at least)|#|
9.0|#|Fast focusing, excellent handling, high frames per sec shooting (ideal for sports)|#|Manual not very comprehensive, had to check online for full details of certain options.
10.0|#|Touch screen, Excellent quality. Clear menus|#|No Headphone socket
9.0|#|Slightly lighter than my EOS 40D,focusing  much faster using my Tamron 16 to 300 zoom lens. Simpler to use,didn't think I would like the pivotal LCD screen but was pleasantly surprised.|#|Haven't found anything.
9.0|#|Many features and options that will take sometime to appreciate and decide as to which ones can be used in the type of photography one undertakes. Is WiFi enabled. Need to have correct types of lenses to use with this.  (I can use the lenses that I had for the 700D.)|#|To make most of this one needs to spend some time appreciating all of the many things this camera can do. It can be used as point to shoot but that would be misusing this brilliant camera.  So it will take time and effort to make the most of this.  And I am trying to do that.

8.0|#|I upgraded to this after using Canon 600D for 2.5 years and I must say this has been a good change. The touch screen, back dial makes it so easy to use. The 19 point AF system is a blessing.|#|None that I can find. Im an amateur photographer anyways.
9.0|#|Touch screen really good|#|None yet found
10.0|#|A really great camera.  Touch screen technology makes changing settings straightforward.  Excellent image quality and wide range of features.  A brilliant all rounder.|#|Not found any
9.0|#|Nightime handheld (SCN) scene mode works very well (no need for flash, uses 3 images)|#|Only annoying drawback is with the remote viewing of images, at 20MB per image it can take a good few seconds to render picture detail on a wi-fi connection to a pad or phone - unsure as to what connection speed the camera can operate at.
8.0|#|So far every thing works. Good quick focusing, sharp pictures after not to much computer manipulation, that's if you like sharp pictures. A little smaller body than my 50D. Wifi works well saves plugging in or taking out SD card.|#|Video Screen in the bright light. Back off screen will scratch easy. Battery life not great just ok, keep a couple spear.
9.0|#|Viewfinder visibility and new focus screen very nice|#|HDR / creative functions available on JPG only
10.0|#|I'm a seasoned Cannon camera user, but it will take a while to get to grips with all the features this excellent camera has. It is great to save money and waste by being able to use the lenses I already own.|#|Nothing  much discovered yet, except that no geopsitioning locational tagging to photos is a disappointment as more basic Cannon cameras include it as does the iPhone
9.0|#|Generally good and easy to use, had previous Canon cameras and this follows their lead.  The slaving of flash is easy and useful in creative photography.  Wifi works but is not the easiest to use.|#|Wifi setup, more difficult than you would expect.
9.0|#|I've only had the camera a short while, but so far it's a great investment and would recommend|#|
9.0|#|The touch screen is a good development, didn't think I would use it but it is definitely easier and quicker then scrolling etc with the dials|#|Not sure how the plastic body will endure compared to the metallic previous models - guess I will find out first time I drop it!
10.0|#|Able to use my i-pad to view photos and operate  the camera. Ease  of use improved over my 60 D.|#|Have not found any yet. Very excited to take to Zambia later this week.

9.0|#|fast, comfortable in hands, positive and responsive to adjustments and changes in settings.|#|none yet
10.0|#|I am biased because I have always use Canon and would recommend highly for anyone who enjoys their photography and is relatively serious about it. I haven't spent time yet on my new Canon EOS 70D and so can't really add a list of good points but having been using the60d for the last few years I'm sure there will be a few.|#|So far no bad points
8.0|#|It's a present so no comment|#|
9.0|#|Good when shooting in low lightnings|#|none
10.0|#|Having had a chance to use it on trip recently, I was satisfied with my purchase.|#|Obviously its an APS-C camera and so there are limitations with that but otherwise none so far.
8.0|#|Much better focus and quick set ups.|#|Bit plastic
10.0|#|Great camera, speedy, excellent image quality, wireless operation +++|#|
9.0|#|The best digital camera I have ever used, it is very versatile, all modes easy to access and use.|#|It is early days yet, nothing comes to mind.
9.0|#|Excellent video focusing.|#|One or two buttons could be easier to use.
5.0|#|Now includes video and a 20 MP sensor over my old 20D body. Can still use all my Canon lenses.|#|And the fully automatic mode is stupid - instead of focusing on the item in the centre it focuses on all the outer points hence the main item at the centre item is out of focus, and when focusing on the scene a mile away the flash pops up and fires(?) You cannot force it or set it to focus on the item in the centre in automatic mode if the sensor locks on sufficient external points. I manually focus the camera most of the time because I cannot trust it.
9.0|#|High ISO rating, fast repeat shots for action|#|Swing out screen slightly less convenient than direct view.  Minor point that functions are in different places from the 450D
8.0|#|The LCD monitor's ability  to flip out and rotate is most helpful.|#|
10.0|#|camera is awesome|#|for stills, i would save a bit more and get the 7d or d610 full frame for superior image quality
10.0|#|I love this camera. Killer features include in camera HDR and multiple exposure. Spot on focussing and it fits in my hand like a glove.|#|The frame counter only goes up to 999.
10.0|#|I haven't been out a lot due to other commitments but so far I am very impressed with it|#|I haven't tried the wi-fi yet as I can't yet find the app I need on Apple. working on that one
10.0|#|This was an upgrade from a 700D, and wow, what a jump! The tech in this is just amazing, the features are so much improved (RAW editing, extra photo filters, like Tilt Shift) and the extra buttons on the camera means you can control with a lot more ease of use. One of the best upgrades I've ever done.|#|The ONE thing I didn't like, you can't change the colour of the menu screen! :) Everything else is just amazing.
10.0|#|Simply perf|#|
10.0|#|I bought this camera for my husband who is very pleased, he finds it quite easy to use having had a previous Canon and thinks it is an very good camera. Our daughter, a professional photographer (children/babies mainly) has used it several times whilst out and in her studio for clients photoshoots and is very impressed with the results.|#|Nothing he can think of!
9.0|#|Excellent update on previous versions.|#|Not yet!
9.0|#|The touch screen is very useful and the speed of recording the pictures is fast. Picture quality so far has been excellent.|#|It is fairly heavy, but in some cases this can be good.
9.0|#|Canon 70D is an excellent camera. Fast focus and the bulit in Wifi and the touch/swivel screen are useful features.|#|It's early days so finding things I don't like are mostly small niggles, like the buttons and the on/off switch all of which are not as slick as on the Nikon D7100. So I gave it 9/10 because I consider the build quality to be not as good as my Nikon D7100, yes I have Nikon and Canon so I can give an unbiased opinion.

9.0|#|The flip out screen makes a huge difference when shooting at lower levels|#|The selector wheel isn't that obvious when pressing it, sometimes it leaves you wondering if you have pressed it or not! It is responsive but just not always obvious if it had been pressed fully
10.0|#|A fantastic mid priced canon eos camera that takes beautiful crisp images.|#|Go for the version with the lens as my old lens has old motor technology which is quite loud for HD filming.

Very pleased and don't regret buying.|#|The only minus is the fact that it is a lot heavier than my 600d but I expect I will get used to that.

8.0|#|Great specifications|#|Sometimes a little complex with some manual over-rides needed to give some better options.  Not had this long enough to fully test but this is only a minor negative

10.0|#|I did have to wait a while fr I to deleiver however most definetly worth it! And same regarding the cost! It's a lot of money however for my line of work it is definetly worth it!!!|#|Costly but was worth it!!!
10.0|#|Dual card slots|#|er.....none - the perfect wedding camera!
10.0|#|Both output Images and build are top quality - there's a lot been written by the professional pundits about the Mk3 and it seems they are spot on with their assertions.|#|it soon became apparent that to own a good set up = decent fast memory cards (x2) a few L lens; extender, flash, remote release, prime lens and case the initial purchase spend could easily triple.......and all with only 1 years warranty. At this level for amatuer use surely 3 years should be a part of any deal - not silly priced warranty extensions - come on Canon your product looks and feels great where the confidence in your product
9.0|#|Would definitely recommend this.|#|I also think it's a little mean that Canon don't include a screen protector - for the sake of a few pounds, it really would make a lot of difference and stop the inconvenience of having to buy one separately for additional cost.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality when paired with the right lens, simple things reasonably easy to accomplish, works pretty much like other canon camera. Intricate interface with a lot of functionality. Does however work out of the box. Rich full colours, sharp focus, good tracking [when you set it up right!]...|#|Intricate interface with a lot of functionality that needs some research to get it right and working well. Manual not exactly a easy read, so an outside guide is worth investing in. Not much else really. A damned good camera that's worth the money [every hard earned penny]
9.0|#|Full frame sensor with crop frame speed. This is what the mark 2 should have been. Excellent AF, and DR.|#|It is expensive, nil other problems
9.0|#|Low light performance|#|You'll have to have insurance

10.0|#||#|Ive yet to find some...
9.0|#|Lightweight (compared to 1DS, 1D etc.)|#|Need to upgrade Lightroom (to Lightroom 4) or use Adobe DNG converter to download files
9.0|#|Fantastic quality and features, worth the money.|#|Quite heavy and a bit pricey but worth it.
10.0|#|The immediately noticeable improvement is actually the fantastic viewfinder. It just seems so much clearer and brighter. And the build feels even better than the Mk2. I also have to use Nikon's at work but for me there is no comparison in terms of logical layout and menus.|#|Very few. It's just a shame that my old Mk2's grip is useless as that was £250 wasted but the new one is a better design. There are now so many buttons its getting like a Nikon..... Finally, I don't find the menus quite as intuitive....yet. There are so many options and accessing them doesn't seem as quick and easy as a result though you can pic a few of your favourites and create your own quick menu, the number is too limited. (About 6 I think)
10.0|#|Auto Focus system.  Image Quality.  Low noise even at higher ISO. Build quality.  So much to like about this camera and it's great fun to use.  A great step up for anyone wanting to go full frame.|#|Price.  You get what you pay for with Canon though.
10.0|#|Better placement of buttons. Very good weather sealing. The real-metal-body gives a wonderful quality feeling. New screen and 100 % of the picture is showed in the view-finder. The electronic level help is really useful especially in darkness and the Auto-Focus system is just so much better than in Mark II and also the different Case mode for AI Focus is excellent!|#|Not really bad but during winter with gloves I find myself to remove the gloves in order to use some smaller types of the buttons on the camera - but without gloves no problem at all!
9.0|#|It's an excellent camera, image quality and focusing wise, as good as one could get without going to the expense of the 1DX, can be straight forward to use but if you specialize as an amateur photographer as I do, like wildlife mainly then the camera has all the versatility one would need for almost every situation, especially low light condition now with the high ISO and low noise image quality, the focusing on the MK111 is significantly superior than the MK11and better than the 7D, excellent build quality to! In my opinion it has everything you could want from a camera whether its wildlife, sport, weddings or just home life.|#|cant think of any.
10.0|#|Beautiful quality, easy to use, excellent AF system!! Great buy, though a big jump in price!|#|Very annoying that the editing infrastructure isn't in place..3k on a camera, yet no software is ready for raw editing!?! Whats that all about - seriously bad planning..no excuse!
9.0|#||#|Doesn't come with a Canon UK charger.  Rather a US 2 pin charger and a clumsy adaptor.  On the plus side good for travelling but annoying when in the UK.  They should have explained this at the time of ordering.

9.0|#|AF System|#|Expensive
8.0|#|Greater depth of field for same distance to subject compared to crop sensor|#|Picture quality is definitely better than 550D but not substantially for the money - but it is early days in my use of the camera
10.0|#|This is the ultimate camera, I have worked with crop sensor cameras for years but the image quality of this camera blew me away. It is so pin sharp, the soft shutter release is perfect for wildlife photography and the extra AF points makes it so much more versatile. The build quality is as you would expect from Canon and the redesigned shell makes it easier to hold. The rear screen is crisp and easy to view in all light conditions.|#|As yet I haven't found any
10.0|#|Where do I start.... It's fantastic!|#|Can take a bit of finding your way around all the features as there are so many. Hence the 9 out of 10 for ease of use.
8.0|#|Autofocus drastically improved from the 5DII.  Also the higher ISO is even better.|#|Really don't like the fact that you cannot have a red focus point on servo mode.  It's black, which often doesn't show up.  This is a retrograde step from the 5DII as the focus point is almost impossible to see if there's any detail in the shot.  You have to kind of remember where it is.  Apparently due to the way the sensor is designed there is no fix.
10.0|#|Big Step up from the EOS 5 Mk I I was using, just as easy to use but quicker focusing, sharper focusing, excellent image quality|#|None yet

10.0|#|This is the 2nd one I have bought. These cameras are top notch..|#|None
10.0|#|We use these cameras in our book scanners because of the speed of download, excellent colour image quality and the ability to have complete control from a PC.|#|With very heavy use these cameras sometimes develop a moving part fault but Canon servicing have always been able to make the necessary repair.

10.0|#|Best of type camera - excellent all subject all situation full-frame camera with very good image quality.|#|Must know what you are doing to get the best from it.  A steep learning curve to master all of its capabilities.
9.0|#|Familiar product, great workhorse camera. I like the mirror lock-up facility. Shutter release is very soft compared to the Mark 1. AF variations are excellent and the controls are in the right place for me. The menu preferences in My Menu are very helpful as I found that navigating through all the options time consuming when in the field. There maybe a shorter method but I have not found it yet. Battery life much improved. Like the level facility on the information screen. Not really used Live View as yet so cannot comment on this. Camera not bought for it's video facility but I will have a look at this in due course. Like the dual card facility.|#|Suspicion the images are over exposed slightly compared with a Leica M9. I suspect wifi connections to download images will come in the next model.

10.0|#|Having upgraded from the EOS400D this camera feels and is much heavier. However the moulded grip is so much better so that you feel you have a solid hold on the camera. In fact you get the impression of a solidly built camera. Easy to start by using the full auto mode|#|No bad points. It just takes a while to get to know the camera when venturing from full auto mode
10.0|#|Fantastic camera moved up from a d5 so l have to get my head around the new layout .the images are second to non hi definition good for cropping in Photoshop.|#|So many new features on the camera I have had to buy a second instruction book but I still love the camera. This is not really a bad thing you gust have to take your time to get your head around it all.

Easy to use the basics straight off, but the menu on the 5DMK3 is getting very busy with access to many features that probably will never get used so a bit of a shame they cant be hidden away. Saying that its probably just a case of getting used to them.

I bought it mainly for the low light settings as I am a gig photographer  and I am delighted with 5he difference.  A huge step up from 5he 7 in every single way.

8.0|#|The Big bonus with the camera is its picture quality which is very good even in comparison to my  DSLRS.|#|I think for the price Canon could have included a cheap infra red remote trigger. The really big let down however,  is the lack of a built in viewfinder. You can buy one from Canon but its price is prohibitive.  I personally feel that using a viewfinder helps keep the camera more stable than using screens at 'arms length'.
4.0|#|compact. Great image quality especially in low light. Love the touch screen, especially the ability to use for shutter release.|#|It doesn't have GPS and I couldn't get it to link to my phone via the Canon app. I have a GoPro which links to my phone via an app - it's slick and easy, the complete opposite to the Canon one. They need to review this. It's well below what I've come to expect from them.

I have experimented with the WiFi and expect as I get more familiar with the camera I shall use this more. The results from the camera are excellent. I have just returned from the VE Day airshow at Duxford and am really knocked out by the results.|#|Nothing so far. The only thing I would point out is that the batteries for the camera are expensive.

10.0|#|An outstanding Camera and Lens package. Image quality is excellent for both stills and HD video. User friendly with a host of features that would satisfy both the amateur and professional. The facility to fire speedlites off-camera is a really useful tool which saves spending a lot on the Canon ST-E2 Speedlite Transmitter. I can fully recommend the Canon 7D and 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM.|#|Nothing
9.0|#|Although the camera its heavy, it feels balanced and robust in your hands.  The buttons are well placed even for my small hands.  camera responds well even in cold weather.|#|you would think that a camera of this quality would have a lens hood supplied and a protective coating or cover for the display screen.

10.0|#|I have no hesitation in highly recommending both camera and lens to anyone|#|Due to pressure of work I haven't spent as much time using the camera as I would have liked to but to date I have found no bad points with either the camera or the lens.
10.0|#|Amazing image quality, and the inbuilt wireless flash control is really useful for external lighting. The new viewfinder overlay is incredibly useful, as is the increased number of AF points.|#|Possibly the weight, as it is slightly heavier than the 50D. Other than that, nothing at all.
8.0|#|Great image quality and user friendly interface.  Camera and lens combination feel well balanced in the hand.  Very useful focal length range equivalent to 24mm-136mm on this body.   Lens image stabilisation performs very well.  Great battery life and very fast auto-focusing.  Built-in flash very useful to have.  (More expensive professional 5D and 1D series do not have built in flash so that's yet more expense to buy a flash gun.)  Useful bundled software including EOS Utility to control camera via computer.  Overall, a highly recommended camera, full of features, but don't just take my word for it. Do your research and read/watch some of the hands on reviews.  If you just want to take snapshots it will do the job very nicely, but there are less expensive models which will do equally well.  To get the most out of this camera it is definitely worth reading the manual and also to turn the dial out of the automatic modes. {;¬)|#|Lens suffers from zoom creep between around 24mm-50mm when pointed vertically upwards or downwards.  In reality it is not a big issue.  Relatively slow lens (f/3.5-f/5.6) so not great for action in low light. It was a toss-up between this and the EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 lens.  In the end I chose this for the extra zoom range and the fact that I don't shoot much low light action.  It does not sound like much, but even the extra 2mm coverage at wide angle is quite significant - great for landscapes.   Canon, why no lens hood?

10.0|#|I bought the EOS 7D as a replacement for my ageing EOS 350D and have been blown away by the features and the overall quality of the camera.  You HAVE to spend time with the manual exploring all of the options then it all makes sense.  The best features are the quick menu to accessing all those things you use most of all, the user definable menu, the large LCD screen and of course the IS Lens which is a brilliant 'standard' lens for this amazing camera.|#|Its a bit heavy but hey you don't get all this good stuff without adding some weight.  I'm also finding it difficult to get used to the on/off switch on the left, for me its just not intuitive.  You hold the body of the camera with your left hand and press the shutter with your right, its slightly annoying to level the camera with finger on the button to find you have to re-adjust your grip to turn it on.  I've overcome this by setting the auto-off time to its maximum so I rarely end up with it going off - now I just need more battery power!

10.0|#|After reading the other reviews, I was looking forward to getting to grips with all the new setting and the steep learning curve that I have heard about but was disappointed as it was not much different than my 450D and at first I didnt think the picture quality was much better ether, until I compared the shots on exactly the same setting 450d v 7d the difference is tremendous and the 15 / 85 mm lens that came with the camera is excellent.|#|None yet

8.0|#|Very capable camera/lens combo of doing just about any photo shot you want. Its an expert camera for those willing to read the manual and learn it. No matter what level you are, be prepared to study, practice and learn before you get the hang of this fine piece of machinery.|#|Read the Manual!!! Its not for a the point-and-shoot level photographer.
10.0|#|A outstanding engineered piece of equipment|#|none
9.0|#|Fantastic camera all round. I use it for wildlife (my passion) and people (because I'm considered to be a reasonable photographer with a very good camera). The wide angle lens is of great use and high quality. The APS-C camera sensor (that collects the light for the photo) is smaller than 35mm which results in a magnification of the picture so that a telephoto lens gets you closer to the birds. The down side is that wide angle shots require what would seem to be an extreme wide angle lens. This lens sorts the problem well and is good value when purchased together.|#|
10.0|#|I am a newbie to the dslr and I find the 7D very user friendly, I have not used all the functions yet but I have took some very good photos which I was very impress with, the 15 - 85mm with 7D is a perfect match for allround photography and It's very good for getting started with, I am happy with my purchase and learning more and more things everyday.|#|The only thing I don't like about the 7D is the strap, it get in the way and its uncomfortable, if Canon made the strap with a quick release and  more comfortable that would be great, I will just have to go and buy one.

10.0|#|wanted to buy a good quality digital camera, easy to use, for a weekend to see the Edinburgh tattoo.  Quality of photos were excellent and the video images were also good.  Bear in mind I am an amateur, so to me the photos were very good.  Easy to use, but i just selected auto mode, as I only had the camera one week before my holiday.  I know that there are many feautures available, which I am unable to use to full potential, but I am enrolling on a short part time course to learn more about digital photograpy, so hopefully will be able to take better shots.|#|No bad points.
9.0|#|Large touch screen which is very easy to use.  Lots of different picture options (colour accent, colour swap, miniature etc.).  Good zoom.|#|Can't think of any, very happy with this camera
10.0|#|Highly recommended as a convenient to use, high-quality image-maker|#|Possibly a bit too 'automated/gimmicky' for the real photo-freaks when compared with say, the superb Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ10 or the (rather more expensive!) Canon Powershot G11.
10.0|#|easy to master|#|nothing

10.0|#|So many features - had the Cannon  XUSV for years, which did me great service but this is in a league of its own!  So many facilities I can't name them all here, as though I got it for Xmas I only started using it Saturday for my granddaughter's birthday and I was just picking it up as I went along, but think I need to sit down and read the manual as I don't think I'm getting the best of what it can do at the moment.|#|Nothing!
10.0|#|Personally I haven't found anything bad with this produdt yet, if there are any.  I received it as a gift from my husband for Christmas after my old Canon of approx 10 years gave up on me.  I find it so easy touse and I particulaly like the fact that I don't need to put on my reading glasses all the time to make sure I am doing the right thing.  With the large screen it is so easy to see a good (or bad) picture and the controls are very simple.  Yes I would highly recommend this for a lightweight camera giving ease of use and very good pictures.  Bear in mind thought that it does not come with a small memory card to get you started, you need to buy one at the same time.|#|

8.0|#|It is easy to use but it takes a little learning curve to get the best results. The camera has a lovely look and feel and had a few compliments when I asked strangers to take photo's for me.|#|One bad point I would say is because of the sexy design of the frame the front cover has a radius in all directions, which means the base surface area is very small and makes the camera rather unstable to stand for self timer shots.

6.0|#|If you can get it to work properly the video mode provides good quality with excellent sound quality.|#|The battery compartment is hard to open and removal of a battery is cumbersome.  And Canon's customer service fobs you off and isn't the quickest, it took them nearly a month to finally answer questions, questions that should've been answered by the manual. The camera has been sent back for repair, which going by other comments online is inconclusive.

10.0|#|I am delighted with my camera and accessories. Thank you|#|
9.0|#|Have only taken about fifty trial photos in the week I have had it, but found it easy to set up, without downloading the manual, and easy to use.  Every function is spot on and the resulting images have been great.  I have not used the video functions, as I only use a camcorder for that, so I cannot comment on that aspect or whether the biggest criticism of the battery iapplies or not.|#|Although most compact cameras seem to require you to press the shutter button half way prior to taking a shot, I did have a small problem when everything seemed to go blank for a fraction of a second, bt now even that is of no consequence now I am used to it. I only wish that there was a lens cap or something to protect what could be a fragile shutter.
9.0|#||#|The camera is fantastic but don't buy from simplyelectronics. They delivered my camera after 3 weeks, not the 10 days they claimed and only after I emailed 10+ times. It seems from other reviews online that people have had to wait far longer for their camera. I am also not sure if the warranty is valid in the UK. Buy from a decent company and you won't be disappointed.

8.0|#|I have a good quality large super zoom but use this compact more.|#|The zoom is exceptional but anything over 18 X zoom needs a tripod or resting on something.
10.0|#|Great camera, easy to use, fits in the pocket and meets most scenarios without needing big lenses or expensive cameras. Picture quality is great.|#|The only things I don't like are the manually raised flash and the lack of optical viewfinder, but I really am being picky to mention anything, after all it is a proper compact camera.

The IXUS has also several fub features that would appeal to anyone who also uses photoshop or similar computer programmes.|#|I am not aware of any. Perhaps it is worth mentionong that the mechanism that closes the lens is clever (integral to the camera), but do not allow nieces, cousins etc to fiddle with it as it is vulnerable to breakage - as I found out with my own camera

9.0|#|This is the third Canon ixus as I like mine so much, I bought my Daughters the same camera. I have had many cameras over the years but this one is superior. Friends have purchased the same after seeing the quality of mine.|#|Like many cameras, expensive to repair and cheaper to replace.  Seems a shame that the damaged camera(s) can't be recycled.
10.0|#|A great pocket camera with substance and style. Easy to use with great quality images. May be a bit on the small side for very large hands but ideal for nimble fingers. Uses an SD memory card and a lithium Ion NB-6L battery which are easy to source for spares.|#|No technical bad points but would have liked a cloth pouch supplied to keep it in.
10.0|#|Has a good solid feel, truly recommend this camera!|#|Some of my pictures didn't show up when i upload them to pc...after some research I discovered that the class of SD card wasn't high enough for the camera...(had a high capacity class 4) when i upgraded to a class 10 I had no problems at all. Not really a camera problem but wish I'd known sooner...

10.0|#|Small, light and easy to use.  So far haven't had to recharge battery but then it hasn't been used excessively.  I carry it in my handbag at all times.

9.0|#|A very good compact digital camera that's easy to use.|#|
8.0|#|IXUS 105 - I found the camera easy to use, the instruction booklet was clear and easy to follow.  I have only experimented with shots so far but pleased with the results. Lots of detail on close up shots.|#|
8.0|#|The camera is small well balanced and fits the hand well. Simple enough controls for all the family to use and simple to download via USB or card reader. We have 3 Canon Ixus in the family and an SLR because of the intuitive nature of the controls and software.|#|My preference is for a viewfinder option for outdoor shooting and the 105 doesn't have one but no other bad points or habits.
10.0|#|Love the camera.  It is so easy to use, and the pictures come out so clear.  I really like the large screen to view your photos.|#|

9.0|#|awesome zoom lens and very easy to take good quality pictures, indoors and outdoors - and I've hardly started exploring the additional features|#|eye view finder is awkward and low definition
9.0|#|Excellent image quality, great zoom, great high iso / low noise.|#|Cannot take filters without an extra adaptor. Viewfinder could be better, but not too bad.
10.0|#|Easy to use. Menu option also has brief description of the relevant functions.|#|None that I can give.
9.0|#|Amazing zoom needs stability as you would with slr with equivelent zoom. Having raw is great, thats what clinched it for me.|#|None that i can think of
9.0|#|Having been a press photographer for over 40 years in fleet st I can say that if I had this camera before I retired it would have made life very much easier.The lengh of the zoom is just fabulous and the picture sharpness is amazing for a camera at this price.Even at the full 1200mm its great and plenty good enough for newspaper work and takes away the need to carry a heavy and very expensive bunch of lenses.I would recomend to anyone considering this camera to go out and buy it.|#|n o bad points really except maybe to many bells and whistles which can complicate things a bit but then I am maybe a bit old fashioned.Also would be nice if it could use AA batteries.
9.0|#|Fantastic zoom range,clear handheld pics of the moon!Great for close ups of birds etc in garden.Good quality of pics,excellent macro.Screen rotates to any position|#|poor placement of dpad controls,hand presses buttons etc inadvertently causing much profanity!
10.0|#|This is a great camera, I have got a lens adapter ,So now i have uv lens ,lens cap, and lens hood This is 58mm Adapter, , You can also get adapter that has 67mm thread ,The adapter is the most expensive, ten to fifteen quid ,which is no price to pay to protect the lens,the other bits were no more than three quid each,  from ebay,Pukka magnification, nice compact well made, Canon are the only one for me|#|A bit fiddly if your used to the DSLR cameras,But you soon adjust ,At high end magnification you must keep stable to keep on target, Again you will soon find ways , ie Mono pod , Tripod , Breathing technique ,

10.0|#|A very good bridge camera for an enthusiastic amateur photographer.|#|The design of the camera grip can result in the lower area of the thumb activating the timer delay. A bit frustrating.
9.0|#|Multi functionality, lightweight, optical and digital performance, features.|#|Too easy to press function buttons, etc., inadvertently
8.0|#|Light weight good size and good build quality.|#|A bit slow on focusing when you need to take something fast.
9.0|#|Small and light enough to carry around, huge telephoto range, good image quality and fast focusing at maximum telephoto range.|#|No RAW image on Auto setting, no exposure compensation on Auto setting and tends to over-expose on Auto setting. In fact Auto is of little use to me (photographing birds). I use P and 'Sports' mode mostly.
10.0|#|It has so many great features there are too many to list. You just have to read up all it can do. The lens is the widest range I have used and I am a professional photographer. I just wanted a smaller camera to cover everything in my travels. This fits that and more.|#|

9.0|#|Brilliant lens. Excellent range of features. Focuses well even at full 50x (with a steady hand). Takes excellent close-ups too. Sturdily built and easy to hold - not too heavy.|#|Not supplied with a bag, which a camera like this really needs.

10.0|#|The SX50 is a great camera. It is a camera which I can take anywhere, not too bulky for travel. The image quality is amazing and it is probably the best camera which I have ever owned. Delighted with it and would recommend it wholeheartedly. Some reviewers seem to have had issues with the eye level viewfinder but I have found it good to use although I took some time with setting the dioptre.|#|None so far
10.0|#|Canon camera is just awesome, incredibly luminous and powerful telephoto lens. The software very easy to use and the interface is logical. For me, the real surprise was the viewfinder, the accuracy of the adjustment. I like the camera really.|#|video recording time is short
10.0|#|Nice and light - great features - great zoom with great results|#|Just finding way round - a quick start paper leaflet would be useful rather than going thru the DVD tutorial

9.0|#|Wanted to photo birds so the zoom is good ,the camera lightThe tilting screen is handy for plants no getting down on wet ground.Still getting use to camera but so far very good.|#|No usb cable so you have to get a seperate one and battery runs down fairly quickly so its wise to have a spare.
8.0|#|Good LCD with clear images displayed.|#|I would like to see an open ended shutter speed for nightscapes, the camera has a 15sec slowest shutter speed. But I guess I'm just being picky, it is a bridge camera after all

9.0|#|ALL GOOD|#|ONLY ONE SO FAR---THE RECORD BUTTON IS TO CLOSE TO THE THUMB HOLD AND OCCAISIONALY SWITCHES ON WHILST HOLDING THE CAMERA.
9.0|#|great zoom|#|low quality EVF
9.0|#|I took some photo's of the gibbous moon last night, and I'm absolutely astonished and delighted with the results.  I used a tripod, but left the camera on automatic, without flash.  It's my desktop image now! Fantastic!|#|It's a bit too easy to accidentally change settings due to the layout of the controls - but I suppose I will get used to this.  Hardly anyone will want a full SLR camera after trying this.

All round good value for money Bridge camera.|#|

10.0|#|Fantastic product, incredible value|#|None
10.0|#|This is an excellent camera, and the price was good.|#|
10.0|#|A great step up from the SX40 HS with the addition of the larger lens, super vivid colours setting and the ability to take HDR photo's.|#|The rear buttons are a little too easy to access compared to the SX40 and can easy be changed by a stray finger when shooting, the addition of a small ridge around the buttons would prevent this.
10.0|#|I have never taken such amazing pictures, even with the zoom, which incidentally is amazing. I have yet to explore a lot the features but expect great results.|#|
9.0|#|Excellent 50x optical zoom.  Very good image quality.|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use, but worth reading the manual thoroughly.  A bit tempting to use it on auto.  Very sharp images, even at night.  Image stabilization excellent.  Super zoom, in every sense.|#|A bit too easy to inadvertently press the wrong button whilst doing something else.
9.0|#|its a good all round camera .i took some pictures off the moon thay are fascinating..thay are so good no one believs me.i have the canon sx40hs from value basket its good now the canon sx50hs is very very good it does all that i whant|#|looking. ther may be some but i find it fine
8.0|#|point and shooter..|#|Longer exposures are limited to 15 seconds at ISO80. Raising the ISO means less than 15 seconds, so not really that useful for night photography. The Lumix FZ200 offers 60 seconds in comparrison.
10.0|#|Quick to take photo's and good battery life|#|to be honest I have not found any. I put 10 out of 10 because I really love it :) I took my time on choosing a new camera and looked at 3 different ones before settling on this one. I think the fact I took my time made sure I made the right choice :)

10.0|#|Generally a very good camera, picture quality very good, and the telephoto lens is outstanding, even gets features that I could not see with my naked eye....amazing!!|#|No thread on the end of the lens to connect extra lens so you HAVE to purchase a 67mm adaptor to attach extra lens to and that is a bayonet fitting onto the camera lens....could be a better design !!!

9.0|#|I bought my Canon HD 50X  bridge camera immediately prior to a very special three week holiday in Asia and did not have time to familiarise myself with it beforehand.   Set on auto it was very easy to use and the 50x zoom is excellent.  The image stabilizer works a treat even when taking photos from a moving coach.   This camera exceeds my expectations.|#|It has a lot of buttons by the right hand and I found my thumb quite frequently hitting the red timer button unintentionally.   This is a weakness.   Also there is a relatively long time in the focus adjusting itself which precludes any photos needing a fast shoot or you will miss it scenario.
8.0|#|Having used or owned most of the bridge cameras available during 2014/15 I can say that this camera although now superseded by the Canon SX60 HS is by far the best camera for outright image quality nothing else comes near it, images are very clean at 80/100 iso  and are still usable upto 800 iso, the image stabliser is excellent as is the focusing.  Other cameras may have longer zooms but its not much good if they then can not deliver a clean (low noise) detailed image.|#|Build could be better but saying that it is not bad and is more than acceptable, the evf is nothing to shout about other cameras have much better ones but it is usable and you do get used to it,  I think it comes down to what you want and although some cameras may have better build and evf's I would rather have high quality images any day of the week and the SX50 HS can give these time after time.

7.0|#|For the price, this is an awsome little snapper that fits in the pocket well.|#|The biggest fault with this camera, is that it is very slow. Any fast motion will be a blur, and it takes far too long writing to SD card. If you need a quick snapper, look away.

And you get a swivel screen, which the 7D does not have ! So you can shoot your HD videos without having to look through the viewfinder ! Precious if you want to film from the ground or overhead and still have a perfect composition!|#|No cons in my opinion.
10.0|#|It was a close call between the EOS 60D and a Nikon D7000 and I'm so glad I opted for the EOS 60D. Superb build quality - nice and solid. The image quality is fantastic - even in low light and having full HD video is a real bonus. I didn't think that the swivel/tilt screen was going to be much use, but after using it I believe it'll be the norm for DSLR's very soon - very useful.|#|None that I can see at the moment.
10.0|#|The top LCD screen makes it easy to adjust settings without the need to enter the menu making continuous picture taking easy.|#|For the price I have yet to come across any bad points.
10.0|#|This is an upgrade from and eos 400d. I prefer to have a larger heavier camera in my hand and this suits the bill. The flip out screen is great, especially when used for low down shots. Control of the camera has taken time to come to terms with but that is to be expected when changing cameras, this being the only reason why it scores 9 rather than 10. The increased number of setting menu's allows the camera to be tuned to your own needs and the ability to save these settings is a good feature. This is a great camera for stills and hd video recording.|#|None really unless you are after a light weight camera or are not prepared to put the time in to read the manual to get the best out of the camera. Possibly the only draw back is that the screen does get smeared very easily, but will be rectified by the purchase of a view finder extender.
10.0|#|Everything ! I moved up from a Canon EOS 400D, yes I know its 4 years later with plenty of more gadgets and features but the technology crammed into the camera is little more than amazing, processing on board digi4 processor, vari angle lcd and HD movie recording, I just bought the canon lens 18-135mm and grip for it and the pictures are totally amazing in low light........ go and buy one you will not be dissapointed.|#|Non so far.

9.0|#|Must be about as good as it can get with a crop sensor. Its really good.|#|NOTHING else.
9.0|#|Having recently purchased the EOS60D  I am currently testing it in the Rockies on holiday.I have the EOS40D with me also and find that the 60D is giving me sharper faster shots especially where time is of the essence.The EOS 60D is quieter to use on those times when silence is needed and knowing that the camera has been weather proofed was a blessing when a large heap of snow fell from a pine tree on to me and the camera . An acciental drop from four feet also proved another of the Camera's merits.I am, so far, well pleased with its performance.|#|so its a constant..shoot, look, replace view finder. shoot.
9.0|#|Brilliant camera.  Great features, easy to use in both auto and manual modes.|#|Nothing serious so far, although a little expensive compared to 550D.  Some hesitation when focusing in live view.
9.0|#|Really like the build quality and image capture of the 60D.|#|Not so keen on the 'squishy' buttons.
9.0|#|Picture quality|#|only one I can think of so far is that Bulb mode is a separate mode which isn't really a problem but I'd prefer the setting to be accessed from whichever function you are in i.e. Tv or Av mode rather than having to change the mode when you need to go beyond a 30 sec exposure.
10.0|#|Great feel. The fold out screen is brilliant and in future would want this addition in any future model purchased. This addition should not be under estimated especially when taking macro shots.|#|Like others I wont use the video. Price. The canon experience voucher that was offered with this model has been rejected as there is no date on the purchase confirmation. New cards were needed as it takes SD not CF cards. Also, quite importantly check which processing software being used and see if compatible with the 60D. I used CS3 and found it could not process the RAW files from the 60D. You can download a converter to DNG files but I did'nt like this idea so I now use CS5 which is compatible.

9.0|#|The fold out screen is a huge bonus particulary with macro shots. I cant understand how more expensive pro cameras do not have this included. Image quality is superb and if you are a canon user the layout should seem familiar. Upgraded from a 400D and the difference is enormous. Like other reviewers I have no need for video but it is there so maybe in future it will get used?|#|Shutter seems a bit clunky and noisy. One huge point to consider is that for post processing I was using CS3. However, the RAW formats created by the 60D can not be read in CS3 meaning you have to convert to DNG files or purchasing a software package that suports the RAW files.

8.0|#|Excellent automated exposure, focus etc. Results are pretty good in almost any lighting condition and it copes extremely well with backlit and over bright subjects. Manual settings pretty much in line with Canon SLRs. I like the presets feature that allows you to get your favourite combination of manual settings for a situation and then switch to them in a single button click when you need to. The manual dial for exposure adjustment is also very useful. The camera gives you the choice of exactly how much help you want it to give you. I've had a fair few compacts and before this the only one I liked was the G5, I like the G12 for all the same reasons|#|Slight niggles and these are down to the fact my other camera is a professional SLR. Multiexposure is pretty slow, seems to average about one a second for me, same applies to bracketing feature which if you're trying to photograph anything moving means you've often lost the subject. When on auto the camera does have a tendancy to go for higher ISO settings to favour a higher shutter speed. The video feature provided produces reasonable results but the zoom isn't available all the time and it would have been nice to have full HD. The digital zoom is very poor
10.0|#|Its so versatile for any user even a begginer and the pictures especially in low light are amazing.|#|Can't zoom in and out while filming but thats the pettiest thing to find wrong with this camera.
8.0|#|Excellent quality photos. Takes the same battery as my G10 and G11.|#|Shoulder strap instead of a hand grip for a pocket camera? HDR mode self processes and does not give the opportunity to process the three images separately.
9.0|#|Out of 300 photos taken on the Canon during a weeks holiday last week, none were unacceptable and few were discarded.|#|possibly only the weight, but overall even the extra weight was acceptable given the benefits achieved.

9.0|#|Fantastic range of features in a small, portable body. Wide angle lens allows you to capture buildings close up, sweeping landscapes or big crowds, then you can zoom in for portraits etc. Camera offers plenty of automated scenes, or you can take over and do everything manually.|#|None
9.0|#|Solid as a rock. Great image quality and nice features. A little buddy to my EOS 7D and very handy and transportable. I used it with a WP-DC34 underwater housing  when snorkeling in the Greek Isles and the results are fantastic! Very pleased with my G12 and waterproof case! I've used it at a couple of indoor parties (Wedding reception and a Birthday bash) with a Canon Speedlite 270EX  external flash and again the results are superb. DSLR standard and no mistake.|#|I had a G11 and although the full HD video has been added to the G12, I think (if I remember correctly) that the 'sunset' scene mode has disapeared. I got some great sunsets from the G11 but took a few with the G12 and they look a little bit limp (Not as vivid in colour dept.)
9.0|#|Very solid construction|#|I'm not a big fan on using the screen on the back to compose a photo I'd rather use the view finder. The view finder is ok but it doesn't have a focusing square.
10.0|#|The flip out screen is a very useful addition to the G12 making it much easier to take pictures both above and below your normal eye level shot.|#|Doesn't quite have the solid feel of the G10 even though it is the same weight.
10.0|#|I wanted a camera that offered more manual controls and flexibility, having had a Canon Powershot 560 previously.  I also wanted something that was easily portable and accessible, handbag size in fact.  This is a great camera.  It is easily transported, quick to use and gives great results.  It is very good in low light and the macro setting is also very good.  The battery life is excellent.  The screen is also protected when closed.|#|The lens cover can open unintentionally if you're not careful.  I had to get my original purchase replaced as the lens got scratched, so I have now bought a case.  Not having a hard copy manual is a drag, but seems par for the course now.  I bought a G12 book which is better than the manual anyway.
9.0|#|Noise levels are very good and only start to show as 1600 iso.  Not that much different from the G11 though, except for the control dial which is set in the front of the camera in SLR fashion.|#|No instruction book, it's all on a compact disk, which is a bit of a drag.
9.0|#|The image quality and functions are superb. The flexibility of a professional yet the ease of use for a novice. The tilting screen is fab for taking natural shots. The HD movie is great too but it eats into the memory card but great results even on a roller coaster! I love and my kids love the fact you can look through the view finder to take pics which saves on power which enabled me + kids to use it for 4 days of our hols 750 + pics and didn't need to charge it! I also like the neck strap as opposed to the usual wrist strap. The bulkiness is great for big hands like mine and the small hands of my 5 and 7 year olds. I don't envisage we'll by another compact for a good time to come because this meet all our expetations.|#|A bit bulky for a hand bag but my philosophy is have the camera out most of the time and take loads of pics. I it gets in the way pass it round

9.0|#|Exceptional functionality with features of much more expensive SLR cameras. I previously owned a canon EOS 400D and this has more functions than it did and still provides top quality images. If you don't want to utilise the manual settings the auto settings still produce excellent images, although if it's a snap shot camera you are after look at the Lumix TZ20|#|It can be difficult locating the function you desire at first until you familiarise yourself through regular use
9.0|#|camera before, so I am still learning all the settings on my G12, but I am experimenting with the settings and the pictures I have taken have come out great! if you want to point and shoot then you couldn't fail to get the best results with this camera set in auto mode, the disk that comes with it is also very helpful and well worded for first time snappers. The camera is compact, so literally comes everywhere with me, I have had the G12 for a month now and already have the biggest and best photo albums that I have ever owned. Recommend :)|#|Too many settings!!! and I wish Cannon gave you a case!

Takes hundreds of pictures on one charge if you use the viewfinder rather than the rear screen.  Exposure compensation and focusing are very good on AUTO mode.  Colour saturation is excellent.|#|Image quality is not as good as an SLR.  But what do you expect from a compact?

8.0|#|Complements my Canon 30D SLR.|#|The controls are a litttle cluttered and it is easy to catch one of the buttons with your thumb.

10.0|#|All in all a much better camera ..my only dissapointment was the change of memory cards as i'd already built up a large stash from my previous eos.|#|
10.0|#|Anyone who has never taken a photo before can pick up this camera and  within ten minutes take a great photo. I had a Canon eos 400D but the 550D is far far better.|#|None
10.0|#|I think its an awesome camera for a good price for 650 its a must buy for beginners. It has very high quality image capture resolution and full HD 1080p aswell as 720p video capture. the kit lense are great if your really new and want to just get into photography. very studly build fits nice in your hands and it isnt too light or too heavy to carry around. the image exporting is very easy just connect and copy images and video files easily. very good camera for all sorts of events and its really good with close-up almost like a macro very good detial. Features are also there ISO, Shutter Speed, Aperture and many many other cool handy features for you photography shots. Defintely a best buy probably my best buy yet and it is worth it. BUY IT, ITS AWESOME!!!|#|Its hard to see when your taking a picture or while in movie mode in difficult positions for example: if you want to get a low ground shot, you cannot see the screen unless you lay down with the camera. or if you want to take a picture of something above you and you need to reach with your arm, you cannot see the screen. The 60D is perfect becuase the screen is able to flip and rotate. If you want a simple camera and wont be doing complex shots and so on get the Canon EOS 550D. If you know you will be doing camera shots high shots low shots then get the 60D.
9.0|#|Great camera to learn photography on, the images are really sharp and vibrant, all the features of cameras double the price, happy with my purchase|#|none
10.0|#|. HD video is incredible.  Great feature: focussing whilst in live view; you can zoom in 10x to get pinpoint-accurate manual focus on any part of the image.|#|None so far!
9.0|#|Already being a Canon DSLR user, I found the 550D intuitive and simple to understand.  Initially I was unhappy that metering mode no longer had a dedicated button, but found that I can access this mode easily though the quick control button instead. The image quality is excellent and with all those pixels, cropping is a doddle.  The HD video quality is very impressive. The 550D does everything I expected it to do and has lived up to my high expectations.  But..... days after purchasing, the 600D was launched.  Is the 600D worth the extra cost?|#|I can't think of any bad points, but the 600D, just launched, has some useful features: Articulated screen, wireless control for off-camer flash and a useful left hand grip that just might have made me think twice before purchasing the 550D had it been launched a couple of weeks earlier!
9.0|#|I haven't got to use the HD video feature yet so I can't comment.|#|I was dissapionted that 'Live View' in manual mode is exposure sensitive, unlike my previous Canon 40D. I think the camera feels and handles a bit too light, and is definately overpriced for the build quality.
10.0|#|It has every feature that you could wish for. It has allot of manual overrides if required.It is light and easy to use. Well constructed.|#|None that I can think of.
9.0|#|Could go on, but it'd be boring - a very good product for it's price range.|#|5) Video - didn't realise it was obligatory to get a high powered [not just high gb] memory card for this [though with hindsight it's obvious], and frustrated that it only works in short bursts [7-10 mins I'm told] - Still, pretty good for the price.
9.0|#|Delivers everything it promises to!|#|Why can't Canon choose a battery format and stick to it? You'll have to buy yet more spare batteries for this one.
10.0|#||#|I have large hands so purchased a battery pack so that I had slightly more to hold and considerably increase the time of usage between charges
10.0|#|Very easy to use and takes good pictures.  Did not have the opportunity to try out the creative zone features yet but having read the manual it should not present any problems.|#|
10.0|#|Having upgraded from the Canon 400d the difference is superb the new features make the camera easy to use and the live view is great and not to mention the 18 million pixels make your pictures so sharp.|#|None found
9.0|#|I was able to use the camera and utilise the differing features with ease. The quality of the immages were very good and far superior to the images of my older cannon digital camera. It is light and easy to carry . I am very pleased with my purchase and would certainly recomend it to others.|#|I am sure there are some bad points but as yet I have not found them !
9.0|#|Top end features in a smaller consumer friendly body|#|Yet another different battery so I had to buy a new spare as the battery from the 450d doesn't fit.

10.0|#|Easy to use, fantastic image quality, worth at least a look into|#|
10.0|#|This is fourth Canon camera I have purchased in the last 20 years, and once again I am impressed with the product. The technology is first class, and the build quality up to Canon's usually high standards. This camera is, in my view, aimed at the enthusiast/experienced amateur market, and the operating features certainly allow the enthusiast to experiment easily and safely. That said, the Auto features mean that the camera performs well in the more conventional 'point and shoot' mode. Overall I believe that this is an excellent camera which I am happy to own and recommend.|#|None so far!
9.0|#|The ability to shoot full high definition (1920x1080) video is a big plus, which is the main reason why I bought this particular camera. You can also shoot 50 fps (frames per second PAL) or 60fps (NTSC) for slowing the motion down, results are smooth and non jittery. Coupled with a decent lens (the lens is everything) still images are fantastic from the 18 Mega Pixel sensor. The LCD screen is bright and crisp. This being my first DSLR I'm well pleased with it. For the price you won't find a better entry level DSLR, and I did do a lot of research beforehand.|#|Unable to shoot video through the viewfinder. 12 minutes maximum recording time. Built in microphone is generally pretty poor, it also picks up the whirring and clicking of the lens. The good news is that there is an external microphone socket.
10.0|#|screen with live viewing so you can preview the shot before you take it and make ajustments to get the result you want. Takes small SDHC cards with a high capacity and great processing speed for Full 1080p Movies which are far cheaper to buy than the CF cards used in most DSLRs. The weight is very supprising especally when you compare it to the old models like the 350D is a great camera but the 550D feels lighter and can do a far amount more.|#|
9.0|#|Range of features and image is outstanding|#|HD video not as easy to use as a dedicated camcorder

9.0|#|Canon currently doing a cash back deal on this model|#|Can't have continuous AF whilst shooting HD video - continuous shoot must be at the same focal length

8.0|#|sturdy. Quality images.|#|doesn't sync up ty my external flash unit.
9.0|#|An absolutely incredible camera. Like the size, not too heavy for long shoots. Bought this purely for video, and it's excellent. As easy or as complicated as your knowledge allows. Obviously not as good as 7d, or higher end, hence the 9 rating, and images are only as good as the lenses used and the amount of hours the user puts in. Superb.|#|That there aren't enough hours in the day to play with this kit!
10.0|#|Thus the image quality is outstanding in this price class and resolution range.|#|Relatively cheap construction which does not promise more than average durability in the long run.
10.0|#|Having bought this camera as a complete amateur, and I've been nothing but impressed so far: easy to use, and a good manual - you can basically start straight away on the automatic settings, and get fantastic results, but then there is plenty of room to grow and get more experimental. Gets a thumbs up from me!|#|Haven't come across any yet.

9.0|#|I found it straight forward and easy to use with noticeable improvement on portrait picture quality, which was what I was looking for.|#|None.
8.0|#|Camera is fairly lightweight for DSLR with a good feel to it.  The screen is easy to view and the battery life is exceptionally good.  Essentially I bought it for taking pictures of my lads playing football and cricket which it does very well with the Tamron telephoto lens I added.  The advantages over 35mm are massive as you can take so many more photos thus achieving some really great pictures whilst deleting the rubbish ones.  This is great for the teenagers to learn to take great pics.|#|I was hoping that it would be a little easier to capture video.  Photos do take up a lot of memory on the PC due to the pixel quality so you need to be ruthless with what you keep.
9.0|#|good camera in that price range|#|
9.0|#|Easy to change settings and features|#|Haven't found any yet but only had it for a few days yet
10.0|#|Overall, after 2 weeks of intermittent use I thoroughly recommend this camera.|#|The only aspect that stops me giving it 10/10 on value for money is the price of Canon's own accessories - £50+ for a Canon Battery, £25 for a plastic filter adapter etc.

10.0|#|and no need to carry giant telephoto or extra-wide-angle lens, so the Nikon will generally stay at home.|#|Some controls a bit fiddly, but I am getting used to them.
10.0|#|If you're an amateur who wants to take professional looking pics that will impress your friends and don't want to spend a fortune, I would highly recommend this camera.|#|Can't think of any - I'm really happy with it! (But then I am a complete amateur so not that picky!).
8.0|#|Canon quality of lens and image.|#|Fiddly zoom cotrol when compared to previous model. ON/OFF button too easily caught when putting it away. Video button takes up space which could have been used to improve camera useability - it's a still camera!
9.0|#|easy to use camera with plenty of functions and a zoom which is more than you will ever need, Nice to have the option of a viewfinder on bright sunny days. Quality of images is excellent.|#|This is only a 12mp camera which doesnt seem like much today compared to others but consider that this is good enough to print up to A2, probably enough for most....so not really a bad point at all.

10.0|#|Easy to work out manual modes, even if starting from scratch. Sharp focus, even at Max zoom. Several modes for different effects. Viewfinder enables use on sunny days. Led screen tilts so you can take shots of mushrooms etc without diving in the dirt. Very good battery life|#|None

8.0|#|Having had a Canon A630 for some years I have found using the SX40 hs fairly easy. Like the flip out back screen, viewfinder is fairly good (shows information rather than just image). Find that the camera tends to let in quite a lot of light in auto mode so I find setting the ISO at 100 in P Mode gives reasonable results. You do have to play around with the settings to get the best results. I like the features such as colour swap, which works well. Zoom lens is good for the camera price. The camera is more compact than an SLR allthough you still need a bag rather than a case.|#|The fact that to add a filter you have to buy a lens adapter at £27 in addition to the filter. The lens cap is a little fiddly when using the camera constantly.Would have liked an ISO 64 setting. You can catch some of the buttons when manipulating the camera, allthough without consequences. The price seems high compared to other similar makes with zoom features, but is much cheaper that a good SLR with zoom lens.

If looking for a bridge camera this is the smart choice.|#|Wish there was a adjustment dial by the shutter button on top as when in manual mode, you adjust everything with the dial on the back and when you use the view finder its hard to get to the dial.
8.0|#|Reasonably easy to use, great optical zoom, small and light.  Great for someone who wants slightly more than a point and click but doesn't want the complexity of a full blown SLR.

10.0|#|This camera is a big step up for me. When I used it for the first time and saw the results it inspired me to learn more as it isn't your usual point and shoot. I'm happy to say the pictures I get now are not even the slightest comparable to my old a550. There much much better! It does take a little longer to set up but the results are amazing. This is by a long way the best purchase I have made in a long time and I am treating it as an investment as I will be using this for a long time.|#|Non really, it's a high end camera, you can't expect a point and shoot.

10.0|#|The camera is so well built and such a pleasure to use that it is difficult to enumerate its good points.  Image quality is outstanding, and image stabilization is a real boon in situations where it is difficult to hold the camera rock steady.  The camera is remarkably well designed so that it can be held firmly and comfortably with all the controls readily accessible without their getting in the way or running the risk of being accidentally touched.  The accompanying manual is well presented and thorough.|#|To say that it is a bad point would be over the top, but it would be an improvement if the design of the zoom lens could be modified (without the need for a lock) to stop it drifting out so easily when the camera is being carried by its strap.

If I didn't have a 1D3 and 5D2 it might well have received a solid row of 10s.|#|It's very annoying that my old BP511 batteries and battery grips (plain and wireless), which fitted my 30D, 40D and 50D, are not compatible with the 7D. I know the 7D is supposed to be in a different product line from the xxD cameras, but was there a need to purposely make the camera incompatible with these expensive accessories?
10.0|#|Very easy to use. The overall image quality is a huge step up from my 400D. The possibilities are endless with this camera and I can see the progression already. A very happy boy...|#|Heavy and expensive but the beast is worth it.
9.0|#|is a boon for macro work. The different AF possibilities are great - though they take some mastering. To be truthful it is apparent that Canon have consulted with many experienced photographers in producing this camera, as this camera is the sensible development from earlier models, it omits virtually all of the little niggles!|#|The only issue found thus far has been a slight problem with shutter delay on Tv shots. The camera has the facility for shooting HD movies, which (for me) seems an unnecessary addition and it is doubtful that I will ever use it seriously. It is a shame that battery life is slightly reduced on this model, and the price of a second manufacturer produced battery is very high.
9.0|#|Fantastic Semi-Pro camera that rivals and betters the 5D MkII.  I chose the 7D due to the faster shutter speed and better low light capability + compatability with existing EP-S lenses.|#|None :)
9.0|#|This is a great camera for an enthusiast  or semi Pro with previous SLR/EOS  experience. The menu layout is first class with a number of custom functions which should be utilised to get the best from the camera. The build quality is excellent and feels solid and reliable. The quality of the images are 1st class, with great control of noise at high ISO's. The camera is intuitive in use and does not take long to get used to.. Read the manual, get to know the camera and all the facilities on offer and you have got an excellent tool for making great images. I use the camera for wild life photography and 8 frames per second  suit this very well.   Highly recommended|#|No bad points to speak of
10.0|#|Super fast response with a very quick 8.0 frames per second burst rate making this ideal for sports or wildlife photography. Very high build quality with the magnesium alloy body.

9.0|#|I upgraded from 400D so I had much to learn because so many good things to use. This gives you so much more especially if you are doing wildlife hand held. Results on fast shoot on top qual  are excellent for e.g. fast moving orcas and sea otters from a moving ship in a swell at long length. Also uses CF so didn't need to change format though obviously it uses latest and fastest cards. I'm glad I did it!|#|I got a Tamron 18-270 (IS) PZD with the body and they are great together but they do weigh a bit after a timr on your feet.
8.0|#|Solid and better built than previous generations of similar Canon hybrid cameras. Large file size an advantage to a pro. Spot on focusing. Fast burst rate without motor drive. HD video!|#|A bit noisy at high ISO. Clumsy method of changing the ISO rating.
10.0|#|As a keen wildlife photogragher, (especialy birds),I find the spot focusing on the EOS 7D very usefull, it helps me pick out my target and get a good clear shot.|#|I cannot think of any bad points as yet but I have still got to get used to the cameras finer points.

In your hands, it feels a substantial piece of equipment that delivers on all the media hype and then some more! The power is easily controlled thanks to excellent menu access and I just love the ability to be able to refine my personal shooting settings for macro or birds in flight (as examples) and switch from one to another in less than a second. The benchmark for all sub pro DSLR camera's.|#|Learning curve can be a little on the step side to begin with. The only thing missing for me is the ability to take more then 3 bracketed exposure shots at a time.

9.0|#|Solid build quality - takes stunning pictures with good glass. Well appointed.|#|Controls can be confusing. Time spent setting the camera up for your photography is well-spent. Don't expect to just pick this camera up and take amazing pictures. However, this has the tools to create those amazing pictures and rewards those who explore the intricate menus. Get a good guide book!
10.0|#|The good points are build quality and technical specification - this is a really advanced piece of camera technology at the price.|#|Very little - there's a complex learning curve to getting the best out of the camera and I'm only part way up that curve!
10.0|#|Fantastic build quality, speed and accuracy of the focusing, features - its going to be a steep learning curve!, the rear screen is excellent, easy menu navigation, I could go on, but I think you may get the drift by now, if you can afford it, the get one!|#|A minor point and a very minor one at that, the tear screen could have been made to flip out, that for me is about as negative as it gets.
9.0|#|Takes super good speed shots for sports photography|#|doesnt fire speed shots in low light settings
9.0|#|Range of ISO rating, choice of advanced operations/shooting modes. being able to customise function settings.  On initial use images appear sharp and natural.  Choice of autofocus points.  Autofocus is quick but have yet to try it out properly in low light situations.  Although not into movies I can see this as a useful added feature and will probably use.|#|Price

9.0|#|Fantastic camera body with great features and movie making ability.|#|Functions operate differently from other Canon camera bodies, which is a tad frustrating.
10.0|#|Great camera, takes amazing shots.  A lot more features than my previous Canon so make sure you read up on how to make the best use of the features.  Good option if you're an experienced amateur looking to turn pro.|#|Really bad operational manual supplied so you will need to do a course or order more reading material to get the most out of it.

10.0|#|Solidly built, Lots of features, Stunning picture quality...a really excellent DSLR camera!!!|#|None at this time.
10.0|#|The camera was an upgrade from my trusty 400D. It is a lot more advanced and has loads more features on it, it wasnt as straightforward to use as the 400D but there are some great tutorials on the Canon website. The focus system can be quite complicated but the video's explain everything really well. TIP: you have to enable the spot focusing in Menu 3 on the camera, otherwise you're stuck with the autofocus system that is a bit hit and miss.|#|None

10.0|#|I had the 400d before this which I thought was very good, but this 7d is everything..it feels and acts like a pro camera and the video is immese.|#|I think the price could be a bit cheaper and maybe canon should start putting a rear display protector like Nikon...but these are not really bad points more suggestions!
9.0|#|I'm still on a learning curve with the cameras capabilities but it's an enjoyable process and the results are really quite amazing.|#|Still looking.
10.0|#|Screen is great and overall quality is fantastic, big step up from my 20D the 7D replaces well worth the upgrade.|#|Be nice if it included a mini HDMI ti HDMI cable in the box.

9.0|#|Lots of functions.  You definitely need to read themanual while going through the menus.  Picture quality superb.  It is amazing in low light and not too grainy with the noise reduction on.

9.0|#|An upgrade from a Canon 400d so far it has lived up to its reputation, although still getting to know all the features I am enjoying it, feels really solid, I have found it easy to adapt from the 400d..|#|Haven't found any yet!!
9.0|#|The d 7 feels so good to handle,it is the best that I have used.whilst there are a lot of features to get used to,they are all layed out in a very user friendly way. I have needed to take time to familiarise my self with the controls,but it is after all a step up in class for me. overall a great. camera|#|So far none.
9.0|#|Sturdily built with so many specifications you are spoilt for choice.Excellent image quality.I find the ability to trigger slave flashguns a great asset.|#|None so far which can be attributed to the camera but more to do with me not getting to grip with all the features

10.0|#|8 frames/sec shooting, great for sports. Bright view finder. Easy quick select screen.|#|Not really a bad point, but setting up the autofocus points can be a pain. So many choices, you have to decide what A/F set up suits the type of shooting you do.
10.0|#|All in, very good DSLR.|#|Video recording has no auto focus while recording. Very difficult to control focus properly in manual. But as it is mainly an SLR camera. Video recording is just a novel addition to most.

9.0|#|Solid build, feels good in the hand and excellent pictures|#|none
9.0|#|It has everything a semi-pro or enthusiastic amateur could ever want. The build quality is especially good - it feels solid and the ergonomics is much better than other EOS models I've used - it just fits!|#|Not really a bad point but due to the number of features, the learning curve is steep.
9.0|#|easy to use.  every thing you could want in dslr|#|
9.0|#|Great machine!|#|Price!

9.0|#|didnt need to look at handbook as i have a number of canon dslr's.  first canon i have purchased that doesnt hav a focus issue on moving objects. i did move to nikon d300 but i find the 7D more to my liking|#|i havent found any yet
10.0|#|This product has everything you want for a Digital SLR. It's simply amazing!!!|#|Haven't seen any bad points?
9.0|#|Fast, Fully featured, Ease of use.|#|None really, although for me quite a learning curve. ( Still learning ). Read the manual regularly. I downloaded to P.C. off the Canon website. Easier to read and find relevant pages.
9.0|#|Menu layout good without too many levels to plough down through. The 1.6 x crop factor because of the C size sensor makes it ideal for wildlife because the lenses can be smaller and lighter.  Not too heavy to carry.|#|
9.0|#|I was blown away by the weight and build quality.  This camera far outperforms my abilities, and probably goes some way beyond my amateur aspirations, but I love it.  I paired it with the 24-105mm L-Series lens and the colours are breathtaking.  The menus are complex but logical and the flexibility is astounding.  I plan to keep this camera for many years.|#|The 19-point autofocus rarely captures the right spot when striving for a limited DOF, so single point is my preferred mode.  The only other sub-optimal feature is the APS-C sensor, but I just couldn't stretch to the 5D.  The weight can be a little tiresome if working at arms' reach for any reason, but the quality feel more than compensates.
9.0|#||#|many functions.
9.0|#|All the menus are fairly easy to access. The image qaulity is very impressive and the 8 frames per second is awesome.  I do lots of Landscape photos and the TTL level is really useful.  The other level on the screen is also useful when set it up on a tripod. I like the quick access menu button.|#|Not many although it is heavier than my last camera.  It is a little bigger. I also wanted a cable release switch but I have found out they are quite expensive and the one from my old camera isn't comaptable
9.0|#|Easy to use, if you have used older canon SLR's this will be a doddle! Excellent quality build and images.|#|A big jump up in price from the 50D but not twice as good.
9.0|#|Fairly light compared to the full-frame cameras.|#|A bit costly, but shop round to get the best deal.
10.0|#|Bought for my son who is a seasoned photographer and very pleased with it|#|

9.0|#|fast, accurate focusing (with Canon 70-300mm IS USM lens). I use this combination for birds-in-flight photography and the results are very good.|#|Uses CF cards rather than SD cards which are at least twice as expensive.

10.0|#|The camera is amazing, upgraded from Canon EOS 450D to the 7D, due to lens mount, no regrets, excellent value for money, almost half the price of UK model, camera language had to be changed from Japanise but luckily was able to find you tube video with easy to follow instruction.  Otherwise - very happy|#|No manufacturer's UK warranty supplied, as its with the distributor (fingers crossed i won't need it), no printed manual and CD manual is a bit basic, no UK plug for charger, but comes with adapter kit, abit pants so purchased one from eBay for £8 plus didn't realise the 7D took an compact flash card, so had to invest in a few of them unfortunate as i have lots of SD cards
8.0|#|very fast, nice innovations such as automatic leveling.|#|battery life not great, not at intuitive as the 40D
8.0|#||#|They've taken away the creative zones, makes you work harder when sometimes you need a quick snap.
9.0|#||#|Chinese model sent, couldn't understand menu systems.
9.0|#|camera terminology, control screens very good, digital layout not to complicated compared to other cameras of this type. Buttons laid out very conveniently, good grip on this camera as camera is wieghty but well made. Video good with easy crossover switch from stills. Fast 8 frames per second in burst. This is a much better camera than the 550D but both are excellent cameras. Has better weatherproofing although not total as much more expensive cameras. Camera feels a solid well made camera in light Magnesium metal instead of plastic.|#|Not for the snapshot photographer (unless they have plenty of money) it is not easy to understand the controls if new to photography, but it can be used in full auto. Anti-shake system is all in the lenses, and NOT built in the camera, this keeps the camera for the other built in hardware. Does not have the full 35mm size chip, but the APS-C size is very adequate for A4 prints. Canon lenses focal length for 24mpixel chips are increased by 1.6 in focal length on this size APS-C chip in the Canon 7D.
10.0|#|This DSLR trumps the 5D Mark II on every level except for the full frame sensor that the Mark II has! One of Canon's best DSLR's around!|#|no full frame! thats it though, this camera is amazing!

It takes some time to navigate your way around it and its menu, but once you have got there the images look great and with the right lenses your set to do some amazing work.|#|I have only just received this Canon 7D and so am in the process of testing it against the 7Ds I use for work, so at this time I have no bad points to comment on.
9.0|#|Excellent RAW image even at high ISO.JPEGs slightly soft though|#|None

10.0|#|Just a brilliant camera, full of different aids to help produce stunning shots.|#|Haven t found any yet, and doubt I will

8.0|#|all points|#|n/a
9.0|#|Easy to use and lots of features but you need new L lenses for extremely good pictures otherwise in every way it is a very first pro quality camera with 1.6x cropping.|#|
3.0|#||#|This product was described very badly on your Website.   It said nothing to the effect that major component were missing nor that it had been used which clearly it had.   It was simply described as a Stock Clearance item which could of course mean anything.     I would never ever buy a Stock Clearance item from Jessops again.
9.0|#|An insanely top quality camera - it may not be full frame like its big brother Canon 5D, but it sure does impress with its performance and quality.|#|DSLR intermediates/pros only - absolutely not a first timers to DSLR camera. Takes time to learn with all the new features and few setup changes (being used to other DSLRs)
9.0|#|Very fast and accurate focus. Good choice of focus points. Can use EF and EFS lenses.|#|Picture quality on enlaregments is not as good as the 5D mark II.
8.0|#|good camera|#|Expensive, had to change to compact flash memory cards making the overall cost even higher.
9.0|#|Versatility, able to use it for different types of photography.  Viewfinder - especially the wide array of focussing points.  Much improved Live View compared to my 50d.|#|Not easy to use initially - You need to read the instruction manual - a few times - NOT really a bad point but something to bear in mind as the camera has so many options on it.
9.0|#|If you are buying this camera then one would presume that you have a good grasp of the usual manual settings on your existing Canon. The 7D takes you to the next level with high quality fast shooting there at your fingerprints. I love it and only wished I'd had it in New Zealand a month ago what improvement I might have seen in the images I had taken on my old canon.|#|It's a bit heavy but that just shouts build quality.
9.0|#|All the good points I've experienced with previous Canons|#|Time to explore all the features!
9.0|#|well built, good layout high on features,and video is first class|#|price is too high and can not download raw without canon hardware
9.0|#|fgood for film and moving image|#|act the lenses are so expensive Ive only got the body and borrow my friends lens
10.0|#|I am very pleased with this camera!|#|no bad points so far
9.0|#|Fast focusing|#|Haven't found any yet
8.0|#|Huge viewing screen, great live view and the in-built flash triggers other Canon flashes. Waterproofed body seals are good and the 'quick view' button is a good addition. HD video looks interesting but camera not bought for that facility. The pentaprism is great as I wear spectacles and appreciate the clear view.|#|Expensive Canon accessories eg, battery, remote 'anything'.
8.0|#|excellent servo modes for tracking moving subject|#|
10.0|#|Very good quality, impressive user features|#|nothing
9.0|#|Had all the features I was looking for and some!|#|Only the person behind the camera
9.0|#|Excellent quality well laid out buttons. Very quick and responsive.|#|Little complecated but with practice Im sure I will overcome problems with white balance colour choice
9.0|#|solid construction, fast shutter burst, good lcd display, excellent focussing live view, movie mode (though not really had time to use much yet)|#|type mode which optimises high shutter speed shots with auto focus tracking (as does the 40 d), high/middle iso noise,no uk or canon guarantee

10.0|#|Large pixel count with high resolution.  Appears to improve speed of focusing.  Excellent virually noise free images, even at high ISO speeds.  Superb ergonomics.  Quick menu is a breeze.  Big clear rear screen which is excellent in thethered mode.|#|Have not found any yet.
8.0|#|50D cameras, very good frame rate,|#|Perhaps a little early to say wether more (smaller) pixels are required with this camera?
9.0|#|Superb new AF system! Packed with features such as wireless flash control, weather sealing, video, AF microadjust, spirit level and above all fast 8fps!|#|
9.0|#|8fps great for shooting sport. High iso with great results|#|Would of liked full frame sensor.
9.0|#|Overall, very pleased with the camera - had some reservations over the price when I purchased it but no longer as you get what you pay for with this camera, ie. really good quality and a 'feel good factor' whenever you use it.|#|No detailed paper manual provided - all on CD.  A simple 'get you started' paper manual is provided which, in truth, is quite sufficient to meet most users total needs although if you want to know exactly what's happening you will need to browse online.
9.0|#||#|Zero!
10.0|#|Excellent, even in low light. Videos are very steady.|#|Battery needs charging quite often, so needs a back-up. It would be better to have it rechargeable without taking the battery out.
9.0|#|It's a good size, i like the colour (it's different to basic silver and the surface means it doesn't get finger marks on). The screen is a decent size so you can see the pictures you've taken. It has a really good array of settings which definitely help you take better pictures.|#|So far i've not really found any. ALthough the wrist strap doesn't have a fastener on it so doesn't stay on your wrist very well, i'm a bit dubious about carrying it around as i worry that the strap will fall over my hand and i will drop it.
9.0|#|Stunning images from the smallest camera I have ever owned. The literal definition of point and shoot with enough ability to tweak photos to keep the avid photographer happy.  Even the High Definition video is super. Because it is so small I always carry it when I am out and about and as such have taken some really excellent candid images. With image quality like this the thought of carrying a huge DSLR is almost laughable.|#|Nothing really. No case provided, but avoid the hugely expensive £30 Canon case and get a better Lowepro leather case for under £10
9.0|#|Bought this after reading reviews.  Wanted a point and shoot compact camera to take family shots, with decent image quality.  Very easy to use - I haven't actually read the manual yet, just charged it up and started clicking, using the auto setting, which works really well.  Pictures are great and it's so easy to use.  I also really like the weight and feel of the camera - it feels sturdy.|#|
9.0|#|super image quality, almost no shutter lag, beautiful solid construction, very compact.|#|no delete button, no mode dial.
9.0|#|Beautiful looking camera that is easy to use.|#|The zoom button takes a while to get used to.
8.0|#|Great little camera. No bigger than a credit card in length and width. Easy to keep in your trouser pocket on a night out. Used it properly for the first time on a trip to Poland, did everything i needed it too.|#|Did not come with a case or memory card. Although the price of the camera is not bad, for a few pounds more it would have been nice to have these items included. I purchased a spare battery and screen protector on ebay for under £3. I would recommend buying these.
9.0|#|love the look of the camera, the compact size fits easily in a pocket and feels really solid. Screen good, pictures great even in low light, fast start up time, minimum delay in shots and really simply to use, but with all the features if you want to go through the menus (which are a little confusing to begin with). I did quite a lot of research into which camera to buy, for being robust, compact, good quality and value - I picked the right one.|#|
9.0|#|Image quality is outstanding considering the price range it is in, some shots i've taken have quite easily rivalled some digital SLR's. Its ability to shoot photos in low lighting conditions is VERY impressive. It has many different features such as slow speed movie capture which can be quite useful. The build quality is second to none. It is a really good looking camera in matt black. Overall a very good product, well worth buying!|#|The menus can be slightly difficult to navigate at first. Except that, you cant fault it.
9.0|#|response to capture movement.  Zoom quality is also what we wanted.  Picture clarity is great.|#|Haven't found any yet!
10.0|#|Built to the standards of an expensive wrist watch - ie incredibly small, but quite heavy, ie substantial, so quite easy to hand hold relatively steadily.  Zoom range also quite incredible, fast and, for its size, quite easy to set even though its response to zoom commands is near instantaneous. As a minute, every day working camera it is a tour de force, but of course - because it is so small, it cannot hope to equala larger quality, or SLR camera (especially one using film) for the outstanding definition needed for large to very large enlargements and prints. Though pricey, its cost is justified by its performance|#|Like almost all small digital cameras, it lacks a viewfinder, but otherwise there is little else to criticise. Its cost and complexities do justify a better, proper, printed, manual - in English, and the many pages wasted on foreign languages should be used for a much more detailed expose for all the cameras' abilities.
9.0|#|A good sturdy little camera, easy to use. Ideal for the quick snapshots, can also be used for the more composed shots. I use this little camera in conjunction with my DSLR.|#|As yet haven't found any bad points.
10.0|#|I had a Powershot SX210IS but I found it too fidgety as I was used to having an IXUS beforehand.  This IXUS is amazingly easy to use and is packed with features from Low Lighting to Fish Eye Effects, from Miniatures to Smart Shutter etc.  At first the metal casing feels a little rough compared to other Canons I've owned but you will get use to the casing soon enough.  Great build, very sturdy and the HD 1080p video recordings are the best!!|#|Cannot delete images instantly once taken like I'm used to on the Powershot SX210IS.  But get used to it later.
9.0|#|Build quality and reliability - second time I have bought an Ixus|#|
9.0|#|Very small and with many great features, many options allowing you to tailor the camera to your needs. Feels well built and of high quality, great value for money. I have tried quite a few cameras before this and most were not as good and much larger cameras were no better, the equivalent Lumix was very poor unless in perfect light. My old Powershot S60 produced slightly better images more easily, but being an old camera it has begun to die and was bulky and heavy compared to the Ixus which I can take everywhere and almost match the S60 quality and take full HD video too.|#|Like all modern digital cameras it has a tendency to over expose and get the white balance wrong, but you can compensate for all these to produce reliable good quality images. Like any very small camera the aperture is small so slower shutter times are required to get good depth and light.
10.0|#|very few buttons, so easy to use, superb picture and screen quality, good in low light level, multi shot mode excellent, wide angle lense for size of camera is excellent|#|i gave the camera 10's and don't have any bad points
10.0|#|The camera is small and compact with loads of great features and it takes good quality pictures.|#|
9.0|#|Very good price to get this standard camera.|#|The monitor is not as good as the other competitors.
9.0|#|Beautiful design and the photos are excellent for a point and shoot. The camera is very compact and I love the vibrancy on the red finish.|#|After only a week of use the red finish is starting to chip off. I have the official canon case for this camera and take care of it so there is no reason for this to happen. I had a black ixus in the past and had a similar problem. Come on canon, sort this out!
10.0|#|This is a really compact pocket camera with a great range from wide angle to telephoto Its has a solid build, its easy to use with many smart features and appears very versatile. A great little camera. Its a great advance on previous compacts I've had.|#|Haven't found any yet
9.0|#|size, ease of use to take photo, review, delete,|#|none - zoom is limited but, for the size of camera, amazing.

10.0|#|This camera is great as it is small, fits in your pocket and is so quick and easy to use.  All of the extra features are great too.  If you want something that takes a great photo but fits in your handbag on a night out this is the camera for you.  I am made up with it.|#|There are none.
8.0|#|Slim design, lightweight, good for pocket use. Excellent picture quality.|#|None that I've found so far.
10.0|#|lots of features that are really easy to use|#|haven't really found any yet
6.0|#|Overall a beautiful camera to hold and use, and i am pleased to own it, however on reflection i would look for a higher quality image with more basic image functions - and look to add image features using pc software.|#|Finally - and this really is a minor gripe - the wrist strap does not have a tensioner, so whilst it can be looped over the hand, it cannot be secured; an elastic band has been used to this effect !
8.0|#|Very small, genuine pocket camera. Image quality ok for the price and way ahead of any camera phone.|#|Program mode isn't what I expected, you can't set the shutter speed or aperture.
10.0|#|THE ZOOM REACHES 20X EVEN THOUGH SPEC SAYS 5 (5.1-20 IS EXTENDED AND LOOSES SOME QUALITY BUT ALSO WORKS IN VIDEO)|#|had the camera for 2 montsh and no compalints so far, maybe the sound quaity could be a bit better
9.0|#|Superb detail reasonable value considering the size.easy to use.we will see how it works on holiday.|#|Doesn't come with an SD card or extra battery which would make the deal even better instead of costing an extra 30 quid which took some of the shine off the price.
10.0|#|Easy to use, easy to navigate, metal casing nice and smooth feel. Bright lcd showing what image has been taken.|#|none so far
9.0|#|Easy to use and compact|#|No camera card included at all.  I had not realised and it was a present for my son.

10.0|#|excellent love it.|#|
9.0|#|Black colour has a good matt surface, very good build quality, minimal buttons, so very easy to use. Great HD videos, good slow motion videos, great high speed burst. good screen. Tiny, and easy to carry to around. Overall and excellent buy.|#|The simplicity obviously comes with lack of customisation and settings, but that is to be expected from such a point-and-shoot camera.
10.0|#|great quality pics and video. loads of effects. colour swap etc, easy 2 use, so chuffed|#|none
10.0|#|Good image quality at 3000x4000px.|#|
9.0|#|Really sharp photos and easy to carry around. Crisp colours - can't fault it at all.Very compact thus easy to carry in the pocket - handy to keep as a second camera besides a DSLR.|#|None so far. Menu is a bit difficult to access and takes a bit of time to get used to.
10.0|#|Compact, high quality build, fantastic picture quality|#|none
10.0|#|Great camera, i mainly use it for video use but take the odd photos, it captures everything brilliantly.|#|The only bad point i can say is when you playback video it doesn't playback the audio aswell :S
10.0|#|Very easy to use on point and shoot. Excellent picture quality. Amazingly compact. Useful to be able to make digital pictures of about 2MB on A4 setting ie not too big. Very classy finish. Superb value for money. The perfect convenient point and shoot compact camera.|#|Red eye elimination not as good as some other compact cameras.
9.0|#|Great video too.|#|None really,  Except I can't find where my 2 year old hid the battery charger, so can't use it at the moment.  Doh!
9.0|#|Really good camera, it is very small but the quality is brilliant.  Would recommend others to buy the camera.|#|Have not found any yet.

8.0|#|Quite a solid little unit - seems qute sturdy - for the money its quite impressive|#|battery needs to be removed for charging which is a pain - I used to have a Sony T1 that was better in this respect - the Canon software doesn't work properly on my PC failing to upload when the upload oftion is selected - but I probably wouldn't have used this anyway as there are plenty of other utilities includin standard Windows stuff to upoad with - minor bad points really
9.0|#|Compact, good in low light levels with not too much grain at higher iso and optical image stabilization.|#|Flush, small buttons on rear hard to use. This does not effect full auto but using different programme settings is very fiddly.
9.0|#|Very small. High quality pictures.|#|No keen on the matt finish in black.
9.0|#|A cracking little camera that takes pics the equal of many digital SLRs|#|None found yet.

9.0|#|Auto functions are pretty good for most situations. Pleased with wide angle view. Easy review of images.|#|A bit of a faf setting self timer. Metering in macro mode a bit uncertain in bright sunlight - ok in diffuse conditions.

9.0|#|Slim, will fit in your pocket. Impressive wide angle lens. Very clever features like colour accent. Battery life|#|None that I've found yet
9.0|#|Bought from clearance section, was a exhibition display model but looked unused so perfect. Stylish, quality. Would not buy a less model than this for quality of build and features.|#|Not many. Smaller than 230HS hence buttons more fiddly, but I've big hands. Fine for normal use.
8.0|#|Really easy to use!  I've never had a digital camera before, and am generally not very good at gadgets.  But I had this up and running in no time. Also, very light and compact, so will be great for taking on my travels.|#|
9.0|#|Small so easy to carry in pocket, superb image quality, easy to use with onscreen hints and tips, full HD video recording, actually useful range of preset photo features, stunning build quality.|#|Positing of the flash means it's easy to accidentally have your finger block the flash. Some of the more complex photo presets can take time to master, such as colour replace.
9.0|#|Easy to use and great value for money. Full HD Videos.|#|
9.0|#|Small compact,  easy to use and very good results even from a relative novice.|#|No real bad points other than perhaps a protective case would seem a good idea.
9.0|#|, the stability control is a very good addition and the rear screen is bright and sharp. Lovely camera|#|Very few at this price. If this was up near its original cost, there might be a few niggles (slight chromatic abberations and a softness to the image etc) that might be a little less forgivable. But this is a superb little camera!
9.0|#|Excellent point and shoot, now with HD videos|#|Buttons shuffled from previoius HD models, so not as intuitive to use as I'd have liked

10.0|#|Great value for money.|#|None yet
4.0|#|Nice little camera with good picture quality and features.|#|Only lasted me three months - once the extended lens is knocked, the camera doesn't work.  I find this with all of the Canon Ixus cameras so have now switched to Panasonic Lumix TZ20.

9.0|#|Good price as 650D just out, but v little difference between them.|#|The only thing that annoys me a bit is that it doesn't remember settings. Eg changes to aspect ratio, or selecting vivid in creative auto. Once it's turned off then on, it has forgotten. I might be able to get around that by making use of the user settings, where you can setup and save favourite settings, but I haven't tried yet.

8.0|#|First off I must explain I am a newcomer to DSLR cameras, I have owned the 600D for a few weeks now and am thouroughly enjoying the experience. Using the manual (online or the provided manual) I have found it fairly easy to find my way around the camera menus, functions etc. As seen from my rating score I find the camera more than fulfills my needs at least for the moment. In my opinion excellent value for money. I am also pleased with the PC software and instructions for the use of.|#|Only one I have found so far. On the Wite balance setting option you have fixed preset values representing 5200K 7000K etc. I would have prefered the actual K option included in the list, surely it is only a small change in the software since if you select auto white balance it can and will select K values between the fixed presets.
9.0|#|Full featured and punches well above it's wieght for the price. A great feel and light wieght for an SLR. The kit lens with the image stabiliser is a boost to the low light usage. Where flash is not wanted and natural light is required for asthetic reasons. The 4 stops claimed is a little generous maybe, but a valuable asset that many with see improvements in their photography with. The HD video has to be a huge bonus for any SLR user with a few lenses to use.|#|A few buttons have been moved to allow for the tilt/swivel screen to be fitted.  This will take some adjusting to for those who are very familiar with the layout of earlier models. This is a small niggle that will disappear with a month of usage I'm sure.
9.0|#|So far I've used the camera straight out of the box and not taken the time to read the book (Canon 600D for Dummies) I purchased for it. Having only used point and shoot cameras previously I was really impressed with how easy it was to use and quickly learn. I was even more impressed with the quality if the images I was able to take. I would recommend that a UV filter is purchased and put onto the lens immediately before using it, I would also suggest purchasing a 10 speed SD card if you intend to use it for video|#|Curry's took 4 days to process my order which was placed at the beginning of December. I was told this was due to all orders being manually checked to prevent fraud as it's more common at this time of year. If this was the case, it should have been stated at the time of order but wasn't and took a phone call from me after 3 days of waiting to find this out.
9.0|#|Takes great snaps.Good size for my larger hands.Just feel really solid.Love it.|#|When shooting in video mode with the supplied lens you need good light or the images will be dark.
10.0|#|Love this camera. It has produced high quality pictures from every situation I have thrown at it so far. Very easy to use, has auto settings if you are just setting out on your DSLR journey but a whole range of features for those looking to get that little bit more from their photography experience. Nice and light, very easy to carry and handle.|#|Wish I'd upgraded to the 18-135mm lens instead of the 18-55mm

I also like the large screen for viewing my results.|#|As I have the camera only a short time  I have nothing bad to say about it at this moment in  time.

9.0|#|I am a keen amateur and already have a dslr camera kit, i didn't want to get stuck with just one type of camera, so I looked for another dslr, which would give me more help when taking photo's, it takes cracking photo's and the suggestions for changing settings seem really helpfull.|#|So far none.
10.0|#|Very easy to use, I'm a first time user of this kind of camera and I the first time I used it took over 200 in two hours. So Easy!|#|Not yet
7.0|#|I have had no real experience with DSLR's and so have little to compare it with.  It was easy to start taking photos with the Intelligent Automatic setting.  The choice of use of viewfinder or monitor, the swivel feature of the monitor and the touch screen control are all useful features.|#|The serious wildlife photographer may be alarmed at the shutter noise.  I  bought a Canon camera as I was lead to believe that it has one of the quietest shutters.  Out in the field I felt embarrassed because, while the other DSLR's whispered, the 600D shouted.
8.0|#|easy of use, great for beginner|#|if you wanna take some good pictures you must change the lens, not as good as the reviews say, especially in dark conditions, generally i thought this camera would be better in dark conditions but it isn't.

You can pick up the camera amnd without reading the inctrrsuctions you can start and take really good photo's.|#|Price, although Canon is a very good make and I chose this camera over the other competitors it was a hard pill to swallow (although would make the same decision again)

8.0|#|It is a fantastic camera to learn on but I suggest to get body only and get a better lense. The lense is not so great and i already bought a lense with a wider zoom range 18-200. although the better lenses are those with large fixed aperture. all in all a very good camera|#|not really a bad point but if I had to choose now I would probably get a 60D not a 600D, simply because if the faster fps and more alround build quality.

It was fairly easy to set up for the basic use, and with  intial testing it was clear that the exposure controls were able to cope with demanding situations.|#|There was no start-up manual with the camera, the supply of a 'Disk Only' manual requires the installation and printing or scrolling of the pdf file. This is not a convenient way of getting started with a new camera.
9.0|#|The inclusion of a Macro lens in with the bundle price was a real bonus. The usability does not stray too far from standard Canon usability meaning although I previously had a 400D I was able to pick this up and start using it almost instantly. The in-camera lens filter special effects are a nice touch also.|#|

The camera switches on very quickly, it feels great in my hand and the swivel screen is a very handy addition. Make sure you buy a class 10 memory card.|#|No constant focus in HD video mode...but I guess it's not a camcorder!

10.0|#|This gives excellent results whether still photographs or videos with plenty of options with the camera itself to make custom changes to pics using the camera itself. There is no doubt this is a photographers camera. At first I thought I would never use the semi automatic or manual settings but the camera has optional built in instructions to tutor you so you can't go wrong. With a choice of packages including  two lenses and a gadget bag.It's not just a camera  it's a leap into technology.|#|Can be a touch heavy, especially when used with a battery pack. Not as previously stated elsewhere (can't remember where i saw it) not the type you would carry around for a chance picture. When you are carrying this it shows you are out to take photographs. Doesn't come with a record card as standard.
10.0|#|I'm a very keen street/fashion photographer and I'm a student so I didn't have loads of money to spend on a dslr, but I haven't been disappointed! Image quality is fantastic, performs well in all weather conditions even the rain! Small and light, very comforable! Good battery life, so no need to buy an external battery grip. Much better than anything that Nikon could offer around the same price!|#|Haven't found any yet!

8.0|#|Having had the camera for a few months now,  I would just like to say chuffed I am with it.  It feels good in my hands to start with, all the buttons and setting changing controls easy to hand.  The battery life I am particularly impressed with,  shooting on full and fine,  it seems to last for ages,  I can go on a shoot all day confident that it will see me through.  The weight is good,  even with this larger 18-135mm lens,  I find handling it easy.  The quality of the shots are remarkable both for landscape and macro.  I say macro because, with 18 million pixels to use,  I can take a shot say, of a butterfly from quite a long-ways off,  crop the shot and still receive great result.  Together,  I think the camera,  along with this lens combination give me,  versatility and after processing, great great shots.|#|None so far,  but I am working on it. Lol

10.0|#|I knew it would be an OK camera when I think of the amount of use my 450D has had without any problems.|#|The only way I could fault it is that the lens cap is a little fiddly and the lens on the 18-55 kit lens is a little foreward and is a little prone to raindrops and fingermarks. These are very minor problems though and a little care soon eliminates them.

9.0|#|It's easy to use - the quality is good.  I have to say, it's a great little camera and I'm really pleased with it!|#|It drives me nuts that when I am viewing a photograph after having taken it, if I tilt the camera at all  (to left or right) the picture then rotates with the movement - it's probably a great design feature but personally annoys me!
8.0|#|Slim compact design, features both an optical viewfinder and large active screen. Bright sharp display. Good video. Good battery life. Aesthetically pleasing.|#|No manual shutter or aperture settings.
9.0|#|I never give 10/10 as i believe you can improve on anything ........... but i nearly did with this product ... Not one to study Guide books ... I like to pick up and go , and thats just what i did with this camera ... its just soooo easy to use ... the pictures are great and I transfered to my pc with no problem !! this IS the first digital camera i've had, so i cant compere to others ... but as a newbie to digital tech ..... i can't fault this camera .... money well spent !|#|The only minus was the memory card supplied ..... 6 pics and it was full ......................
9.0|#|Very compact camera with pretty much all the features of a compact you could want.  Built in accelerometer means that it knows which way up it is - very cool if you quickly want to see a portrait picture full screen.  Great build quality.|#|Picture quality won't compare to a DSLR, but then you'd have to spend £200+ on a compact for this to be true.
10.0|#|small, robust and simple with good quality|#|
7.0|#|smart,camera.easy to use|#|would be much more helpful if came with a instution manual !
10.0|#|Great camera and easy to use!|#|
9.0|#|Good solid build quality, large clear screen, small compact with some excellent freatures.|#|for individual pictures - I will be very cautious in the future to avoid this happening again.
10.0|#|I'm not very technically minded - I get dizzy when I hear about mega pixels and zooms - however this has been very easy to use. The upload to the compuer routine is very good, and it's been dropped a few times and seems to bounce quite nicely with no ill effects. I'd recommend it.|#|
9.0|#|I've had canon before and I love their stuff. This is no different. Very solid camera, takes brilliant photos. Lots of settings if you know what you're looking for and what to change for what you want - but I don't!|#|Can only have the multi shoot function on the manual setting, and takes a while sometimes to take the pic. For example, I play rugby and my girlfriend wanted to take some pictures, every time she tried to do so I was out fo the frame before it took it. So I taught her to half-press on the area to focus, then press fully to take the shot straight-away. I would have like to to have a sports mode so it takes the pic as soon as you press the button.
10.0|#|good quality for a good price|#|
8.0|#|Very compact and easy to use on auto settings|#|Some of the instructions are not terribly clear
9.0|#|Nice, compact design with an optical viewfinder, great for sunny conditions.  Body feels nice and solid, metal, not cheap plastic. Great value for money in terms of what the camera can do, has the basic automatic, point and shoot function but also allows for manual modes and different scenery options.  Quality of images (10million pixels) is fantastic in a variety of conditions.  Would definitely recommend, especially for beginners who want a decent quality camera but ease of use with great pictures.  Very user friendly.|#|None that spring to mind.

8.0|#|What you would expect from Canon.|#|Just the price but you get what you pay for.
10.0|#|Build quality. Image and video quality. Fantastically compact. Great for slipping in a pocket and capturing unexpected shots.|#|None I have found yet.
10.0|#|right up to a skilled amateur. The battery life is also worth noting, i'm just back from a two week trekking holiday i took around 800 shots and used only a third of the power.|#|I've had this camera for several months and so far i cannot fault it.
9.0|#|Camera is lightweight but has a good look and feel.|#|Had to read the manual quite thoroughly to understand how to play back pictures, not quite as simple as on some other cameras where I have had a thumbwheel to move from one picture to the next.  (thats why it gets 9 instead of 10 for ease of use).
10.0|#||#|None. I honestly can not find any bad points to this camera at all, a great job by Canon.
9.0|#|The camera is great, simple easy to use, a good introduction into DSLR photography. Especially good I thought at the close up shots. lots of features|#|none really you get what you pay for. However I'm dissappointed a little with the image quality..I'd sacrifice some of the features for slightly better focusing
8.0|#|great standard lens and body|#|Tamron lens does not have an image stabiliser so is very difficult to use at 300 zoom
9.0|#|The Canon EOS 450D is packed with features, like a 3inch screen, live view mode, over 12 million megapixels giving beautiful clear picture results etc, it has many of the features of a much more expensive professional camera but it's body is less robust.  It is powerful enough to take the most demanding of shots yet light enough to be carried virtually anywhere, which is a plus point if you have a family of young children and carrying all of their essentials as well.  This is my second Canon EOS and in my opinion it makes an excellent mid range DSLR choice.|#|I haven't found any as yet...
9.0|#|The image quality with the (new) kit lens is quite acceptable, in fact much better than I expected and seems to be capable of resolving the extra pixels. The IS works very well enabling hand held low light shots to be taken (e.g. inside churches) without pushing the ISO too much. Very impressed with the sensor, good dynamic range and low noise at ISO 800 (which makes it very usable if necessary). I find the camera handles well, together with being fairly light and (relatively) compact.|#|The only bad point with the kit I bought is the Tamron 70-300 zoom that came bundled with it. Even if you stop the lens down the image at 300mm is not very sharp plus in many lighting situations there is a lot of purple fringing. OK this is a cheap lens but I was hoping for results that were at least usable. I guess I need to save up for a 'proper' long telephoto.
10.0|#|Large, clear LCD display. Very comfortable to hold, nice weight and feel. Controls nicely positioned. Takes great pictures with the kit lenses. This is my first DSLR and I chose it because my old Canon AE1 finally died. I'm very pleased with this excellent camera.|#|Haven't found any yet. Oh yes, I keep getting the urge to buy more lenses for it.
9.0|#|Canon produce some of the best camera's in the business.  This is no exception!  I purchased this camera in prepartion for my sisters wedding, however, since receiving the item I have yet to leave it alone. Plenty of features, comfortable to work with and quite light even with the lens attached.|#|As yet I haven't any, instuctions are well written, but it will take some time to get used to all the features.
9.0|#|Excellent camera, great picture quality, loads of usefu features, quick to get use to the basic use.|#|None really other than with so many geatures it takes a while to become proficient at them all but that can be seen as a good thing as well.
8.0|#|The Tamron zoon lens is far better than the Canon offered by the same price (I have tested both).  The 4 Gigabyte memory card is more than enough for beginners and the camera features and potential is superb.  When testing against Sony Alfa 14 megapixels, there is no difference at all in the quality results.|#|I have no serious problems; I think it is a very good value for money.  Some problems when managing white balance and exposure, the camera sometimes cant get it right 1st time , but this is compensated by the large amount of options available and good use of them.
9.0|#|Purchased to take pictures of my new baby and already 2 weeks on I have stunning pictures imortalising the little monkey. It was worth every penny. Oh yes and it takes the odd work photo too.........|#|None found so far.
10.0|#|Everything.  Great camera.|#|Focus in live view
10.0|#|This camerra is just so easy to use but with the benefits of letting you experiment with the professional side  of things by adjusting the settings. I would recommend this camera purely because it makes all the  pictures i take look like they are from a magazine or out of an art gallery. I am now being asked to a lot more parties just because any pictures i take with the  Canon 450D aare just the best.|#|I wish it was cheaper..............But it is compared to other DSLR's
9.0|#|Absoloutly love it - my first digital SLR and doesn't disappoint. Really easy to use and taken some great photos.|#|Lens that comes with camera is very limiting, so would recommend upgrading - Tamron that came with the bundle is great.
10.0|#|easy to use|#|Terminal cover, flimsy
9.0|#|I opted for the 450D over the 500/550D because of the lack of video shooting and the improved performance in low light conditions. I find the 450D produces less noise than the high resolution 500 series because of the lower mPixel count.|#|Lack of the big scroll wheel featured on the next series up (40D, 50D, etc) makes quickly scanning through stored shots a little cumbersome.
9.0|#|Light and easy to manage even if you wear glasses.|#|A tad expensive.
10.0|#|An exelent camera if your stepping into the world of DSLR and want a bit more than the entry level cameras have to offer. Highly recomended|#|DSLR cameras are like a virus !  You'll soon be selling everything and remortgaging the house to buy more and more accsesseries, beware the moon!!!
9.0|#|The Tamron zoom lens is well built and well balanced for ease of use however this lens is a fraction slower to focus and firmer to select the zoom setting than the Canon Lens.|#|The Tamron Lens hood is difficult to attach and detach without turning the focus system against the motor if AF is selected.
9.0|#|Accepts all Canon's lenses|#|Default sharpening setting is a little soft. This can be changed in-camera, or images can be sharpened easily later (using the DPP software that comes with the camera).
8.0|#|Ease of use. Quick easy set up and simple to follow instructions.|#|Because the bundle came with a second lens I think a bag should have been included.
8.0|#|Lighter than expected, twin lens bundle covers most ranges, good battery life and all main functions to hand i.e. iso, white balance, focus, continuous shooting etc.|#|None yet
9.0|#|Large screen at rear, viewfinder bright and large (although I am used to a bigger SLR one)|#|Small camera bodies can be a disadvantage if you have large hands. I looked at Nikon D80 which felt much heavier and larger in the hand which gave it a feel of quality.
9.0|#|Easy to get fantastic looking photos, and the buttons are laid out well. Good value for the price|#|The Tamron 300mm lense the camera came with was not fantastic, save up and get a 300mm Canon lense instead, you wont be dissapointed
10.0|#|Had a digital camera and have had quality cameras all my life, but this DSLR is brilliant. Have been taking exceptional wildlife photos.|#|
10.0|#|Display is good, all info in a readable format size|#|Not bad point really for a novice like me, it takes some time to get the best of the camera.   It's part of getting a sophisticated camera such as 450D after using digital snapshot items.
8.0|#|a great little camera for both snap happy people and the more experienced photographer.|#|flash charge time after repeated use.
9.0|#|Perfect package to get you started.  Good build quality and feature rich.|#|Shame that the Tamron lens does not feature Image Stabilisation.
9.0|#|Easy and fun to use.  Reliable. Point and shoot and creative options makes this a very flexible photographic tool.  Clear, concise menu options.  Battery life good.  Lens changing quick and easy.|#|Live view shooting, not a bad point, but better results are obtained by using the 450D in SLR mode.  An excelent DSLR canera overall.
9.0|#|every thing|#|I wish the standard lens was alittle better

8.0|#|Design, easy way round it, coming from compact digital to SLR means I've got plenty of learning to do, but the instruction manual is more than useful|#|Only thing I've found so far that's a bit disappointing is the 450D badge on the bottom left of the camera has come off

Changing settings, deleting images and uploading photos to a PC is easy to do and the softward provided is very good to get you started. I am astounded at the image quality, fab!|#|The only thing it doesn't do which some may want is to allow you to use the LCD screen rather than view finder when taking a picture.

9.0|#|I have not had much time to use it yet but so far it seems extremely good.|#|A complex product if you really want to use it in depth which will require quite a bit of study.  A paper manual would be helpful.

9.0|#|Excellent image quality.   Excellent build quality.   Compact and comfortable to hold.   Controls are intuitive and considering the range of features are the best I have experienced.   Face recognition is effective and very useful|#|Slow response at lower ambient light levels, has caused me to miss shots.    A custom leather case would be a much better option than the cloth fabric case offered.
9.0|#|Small, light and pocket size. Good quality photos can be achieved. It is great as a point and shoot but also has manual settings for more advanced use.|#|The manual is on a CD but it would be better to have a manual in paper form included to check operation points while out and about.

9.0|#|Overall I am extremely pleased with this little gem, and feel it was well worth the effort of researching the market.  And worth the effort of reading the 170 page user guide.  If you want a lot more than a snap-shot camera, download the Ixus 980 IS full specification and get ready for some real enjoyment!|#|flush.  You can switch on using the easier 'playback' button.  This immediately shows your last photo and you can easily scroll back, but pressing the shutter button half way brings the lens out and you can shoot as usual.  But you still have to switch off with the awkward ON/OFF button.  The video function is quite good but... I have not found a way of keeping the focus in operation, so it starts off sharp then loses focus if the subject moves in or out.  If video is important to you, there is another Ixus model (cheaper) which has HD. It might manage auto focus, but I have not checked.  The User Guide is a reduced photocopy effort- not up to the standard of the rest of the product.  But it is readable and fairly thorough.
10.0|#|small good to put in pocket|#|none
10.0|#|There are numerous good points.  The camera is feature packed and spec'd to a level which you'd expect to find in a DSLR.  The pre-programmable print button is great feature for assigning various options (I've assigned mine for one touch manual white balance control- great for vivid underwater shots [although the scene underwater mode is also excellent]).  The battery life is great, build quality superb and image quality fantastic.  Having just returned from a diving trip to Scapa Flow (Orkney's) I now have a SDHC card with over 300 high res images both on land and underwater.  It'll be a struggle to decide which ones to print, as there are many gems!  These cameras are a must for any diver wanting to purchase a camera with manual white balance control, without running to the expense of a DSLR.  The camera is a doddle to operate and the supplied software allows for a good degree of post image editing.....not that you should really need to with this camera in your pocket!  For those wishing for a similar spec but with a large zoom I'd suggest the G10, which has the same number of features but comes with a larger zoom lens.|#|Due to its compact architecture, the flash is a little close to the lens.  Consequently when used with an underwater housing a shadow effect occure owards the lower right hand side of the image.  This can be eliminated with the use of a separate underwater strobe, a worthwile investment for any keen underwater photographer.  The digital zoom isn't worth using unless you have a very steady hand or tripod, as the noise created even in lower res shots can dramatically reduce the quality of the image.  VGA movie recording rather than high definition has its drawbacks (although the camera was launched in October 2008, and technology has moved on.  HD isn't the be-all and end-all in fact I've heard that people need to reduce the number of frames per second in order to playback many HD movies shot on cameras as their frame rate exceeds current DVD playback speeds.)
9.0|#|Handy size that packs in a good file size, easy to slip int your pocket.|#|
9.0|#|The camera is a little chunkier than the Ixus 55 but you hardly notice it due to the overall quality of the product. Definitely well worth buying this camera. I spent ages researching this item and found it to be a lot cheaper on this website.|#|The round switch tends to flick to other settings easily so you have to double check before taking a photo.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality, even in low light conditions. The 'auto' setting is adequate for pretty well any conditions or situations that I have so-far encountered. It's very useful to have a viewfinder, an item that is beginning to disappear from digital cameras. The movie-clip quality is very high, including the sound. In an editing suite it's almost impossible to distinguish between the video from the IXUS and the video from my Sony Handycam. The camera is very small and light and an underwater housing is available for scuba.|#|It's quite difficult to get perfect focus when using the 'macro' setting to photograph very small objects. It seems to work best if you position the red dot from the camera's led beam slightly in front of what you want to photograph. Once you get the autofocus right though the image quality is excellent. It's sometimes difficult to know whether you have successfully switched off the flash, as both 'on' and 'off' symbols are very similar and very small. The combination of zoom and macro seems to throw the autofocus out slightly. It's better to move the camera closer to the subject.

8.0|#|Very small and light. Sharp lens and high pixel count are adequate for selective enlargements. A4 prints are sharp edge to edge, A3 prints are pixel free. Manual (etc) options make it very flexible for creative shots. Feels well made. Surprisingly good flash coverage. Joy of joys, it has a viewfinder.|#|Pictures display vingetting (dark corners). Delayed reaction when pressing the shutter - even if pre-focussed. PIctures seem to lack sparkle and most are improved by 'auto correction' on a PC. Digital zoom (only) on video gives unacceptable results. The viewfinder is not very clear and does not show the whole of the image. Menu navigation is not intuitive (to me). Lens cover 'leaves' do not close flat every time.
9.0|#|This camera has lots of features, we particularly like the colour accent setting. The picture quality is very good and easy to take good pictures.|#|The dials are a but fidly and the menus take a bit of working out, if you've had a canon before it only takes 10 minutes with the manual and you can see where all the more advanced settings are.

10.0|#|ALL IN ALL A VERY GOOD POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA BUT WITH ALL THE FEATURES OF A 35mm CAMERA YOU CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING WITH ALL OF THE SETTINGS|#|NO BAD POINTS
10.0|#|It had so many good points it is difficult to pick out just one or two.   I certainly found many things that I didn't have on my other Digital Camera which gave me a much wider menu to pick from, also the number of Pixels which I can now control and use less if I want to. .|#|I did find it a little difficulty with the Zoom button placement as it tended to take  a little time for me to control it at the Zoom distance I wanted. Perhaps it was just me as I was so used to to my other digital being very  precise and better placed on the back away from the shooting position button.
9.0|#|I have just downloaded the first images off it. I have to say they are excellent.I have found it easy to use.But so far have only used the automatic function.|#|the shutter firing.
10.0|#|Excellent product. Although I have larked 'Ease of Use' down, the only reaon for this is that as it has leading features in 'manual' mode that require learning, it would naturally not be as simple to use in this mode as other 'just Auto' camers. That said, in manual mode, it's excellent.|#|Would have been nice to bundle with a case.
9.0|#|Light, small and should be easy to use once mastered.|#|Comes with a cd manual - would have prefered a book.
9.0|#|The macro was brilliant, very easy to check live focus, it will be great for small criters like the Pigmy sea horses and nudibranch.|#|If using the flask and the underwater housing a shadow is produced by the lens extension 'tube'.. I will need to buy an external strobe.
3.0|#|Build quality|#|For a high end compact camera from Canon it is very disappointing.  Far too slow to focus/take and process the image.  The moment is missed most times. Image is not very sharp considering this is a 15 mp camera.  I don't think it is any better than a cheap Casio or Samsung, certainly much inferior to the Panasonic Lumix which is less expensive.  I will not be keeping this - a waste of money.  I already have a Canon digital SLR and was expecting almost as good quality

Great zoom, cd quality  sound on video, zoom works in video mode and is very quiet, not picked up on the sountrack of any I have shot. Viewfinder adequate for setting up shots with all the information you need. Swivel screen makes taking shots above or below eye level easy. Although video is not HD it looks great on 32'' Hd screen.|#|Batteries could last a bit longer but with two sets of quality re-chargeable more than enough.

10.0|#|Easy to use good over long distance without having to change lenses the automatic lens does it all for you. For someone who wants good quality pictures without the difficult technology that some cameras have, this is easy to use and great quality for the money|#|None so far
10.0|#|The flip out screen is really useful (especially for short people to look over others or round corners!).  There is a wide variety of settings.  Because of the AA batteries it is quite heavy but it does mean you can change the batteries in the middle of the day!|#|The dial is hard to use to move between the scenery settings - it takes some getting used to.
8.0|#|Why carry the extra weight and bulk when this has 95% of an SLR's capabilities.|#|Needs a standard screw thread on the end of the lens to take filters (UV, Polariser, Cokin Filters etc).
9.0|#|Easy automatic or creative manual control. Smaller than a DSLR but almost as capable. Superb image quality.Uses standard AA batteries.|#|A bit heavy. Resolution of viewfinder could be better.

10.0|#|I bought this as an update for the SX1IS as I had found this to be a great camera but it has sadly gone wrong. The update to 20X optical zoome is amazing. I find the camera easy to use as separate dials/buttons do different things rather than having to trawl through a menu on a single control. It feels sturdy in the hands and makes photography comparable to my old film SLR but with the bonus that you don;t have to worry about wasting film.|#|Haven't found any as yet

With a little knowledge, you can achieve almost anything that you want|#|If you are inclined to use auto setting only, you may be disappointed. I find myself using the program mode and + 2/3 exposure as I find auto pictures a bit dark.
9.0|#|Well made and easy to use on auto. Fantastic lens and fantastic anti shake feature. Good stereo sound. Feels good in the hand. My best camera so far.|#|The lens cap is easily lost. The menus are a bit confusing (or is it the manual).
8.0|#|shot modes produce excellent results with little or no effort.  Intelligent face recognition that follows your face, multi AF settings galore, the list goes on and on.  The colours it produces are vibrant and realistic and in low light it does a decent job even at long focal lengths.  If you're brave, you can set this baby into full manual and configure everything to your heart's content.  I think the best mode is 'Program mode'.  You can also attach a standard flash beam or additional lenses/filters. This camera is almost SLR quality but for digital camera money.  Have I mentioned it does wide-screen photos too?|#|This camera is not small, it's much bigger and heavier than my previous camera the SX110 and a lot of that bulk is consumed by the gargantuan lens and zoon function.  It can be held easily in the average hand but you will normaly need 2 hands for taking shots.  You will need a proper camera bag - don't be tempted to try and fit this in a handbag!  The stated batttery life in my experience is nowhere near 340 shots, it nearer to 250 but maybe that was becasue I was playing so much with the features and the zoom.  The viewfinder, although it has manual focus adjustment is not very good against the competition.
9.0|#|Well-designed and easy to handle with good locations for the controls.|#|There are a lot of features on this camera.  It would have been good to have a printed copy of the whole handbook for quick reference when using it, rather than have to use the PDF on a computer.

9.0|#|Image Quality is just great, much better than I expected. Really am impressed. Video is amazing too. Very light weight, I carry mine in shirt pocket it`s so small. Battery life is ok, altho I`d recomend carrying a spare as back up. Start up time for first shot is very quick.|#|On/Off button is poorly designed. Cannot find it by feel alone. Taking photos of animals can be problematic unless you learn how to skip through menu quickly enough for pet shots otherwise a blurred image results.
10.0|#|Simple to use in auto mode, spend time exploring the features and be even more amazed what this little camera can do. I bought it to use at a friends wedding and got some fantastic pics, I used it for about 14 hours taking pictures and recording HD videos on the day and the battery ran out when it was time to leave the wedding party. I viewed the pictures and videos on the telly and was really impressed! All in all, if you want a small camera that does so much and record HD videos with great functions and ease of, I would thoughly recommend this camera.|#|It's difficult to list the bad points because I'm so pleased with the camera. If I was to mention thing it would be the size of the circular control button, it's small, but I do have big hands! You get used to it after a short while, like the buttons on a new and unfamiliar phone.
9.0|#|Nothing was straight). Image quality is fine for a camera of it's size. It's not amazing quality compared to the 90IS or something bigger, but for an ultra compact with this many features I don't think you could get much better.|#|Please note that I list all these points being as critical as I can. I would still buy this camera dispite them all. And still recommend it to anyone after a great quality ultra compact. If you want better quality, then go look at larger things that won't fit in your pocket.
10.0|#|Great little camera. I was almost going to get the Cybershot but this Cannon takes much better quality pictures when printed. It's very little, so perfect for the pocket or handbag. I only use the auto setting, but will aim to investigate the manual settings as I think I could take some great shots manually.|#|
9.0|#|video quality are amazing compared to my last Sony camera.|#|Because of the small size and flush rear buttons its can be difficult to change settings or view pictures unless you have child size fingers.
9.0|#|LOVE the colour accent feature - you can select a colour that stays and the rest goes black and white! also fab macro images. i love this camera!!!!!|#|night shots seem to come up with blobbly aura bits (as though there's dust on the lens... i'm sure it's because i've not got to grips with the settings yet but it does this on auto mode as well...
4.0|#|Light camera at a good price. This is easy to use once you understand the available settings.|#|Having to remove the battery to charge is a real let down. Having used the Canon ixus i7zoom which had a docking station for both charging and transfer of photos, this camera seems a little lacking. The Camera Window software seems to have regressed as it has less features than previous versions.
9.0|#|It's tiny! Can easily fit in the same pocket as my phone. It has intelligent auto so is great as a capture anything point and shoot|#|It's got no wide angle - loads of close up shots you just cant get when out with friends in a group. The lens isn't wide enough so you have to step back which means you miss anything spontaneous

10.0|#|I love this camera! Small enough to fit into my pocket and very easy to.  I'm amazed at the quality of the video camera.  Early days but so far no problems!|#|The camera case  - the leather is very hard and the fasteners does not always work!  Camera strap could do with something to make it adjustable to fit my wrist so it doesn't slip off!  I had to tie a knot in it!
8.0|#|Compact good screen optical viewfinder|#|Battery/card cover seems rather flimsy
8.0|#|all round good performance|#|some controls are a bit fiddly for easy/rapid use
9.0|#|It's really easy to use and has great picture and sound quality|#|I've not found any yet!!
10.0|#|excellent results, easy to navigate menu|#|none, hence the reason i have bought this twice, didnt look after first one very well, it's taken a beating because i used it so much.
8.0|#|Eye piece viewfinder as well as screen which avoids problem of bright sunlight on screen when using. Good zoom. Good battery life. Lightweight and easy to carry in a pocket.|#|Need to keep changing setting for image distance as the setting you set reverts to normal when you switch off. As with akk digital screens is hard to see in bright sunshine, one of the reasons I purchased the camera was for the viewfinder.
10.0|#|Packs so much into a small package. selling point for me was that a viewfinder is included, rare on tadays cameras. Vey useful in bright sunlight when screen is hard to use.|#|Viewfinder image is small, understandable in such a small package. At least it does have one.
9.0|#|battery life|#|battery dies in cold weather ( especially skiing )
10.0|#|Great product for the money. ideal just to slip into pocket when out and about. Image quality is excellent as is flash performance indoors. highly recommended for those who want a camera for parties / nights out and for those who always like to have a camera with them but don't want the bulk of a digital SLR|#|Only a minor point, however button size takes a little bit of getting used too
8.0|#|Outstanding quality pictures and Hi-Def video. Very quick to turn up - no delay taking photos (never miss a special moment!). HD video recording is amazing - better than having a camcorder at 720p resolution. The thinnest camera I have seen with these features - slips into jeans pockets with ease. Recommend getting a genuine Canon case and a large SD card (minimum 8GB)|#|HD Movies are in a format that can be difficult to play - without a top-of-the-range computer the video playback on Windows is poor (stutters) or audio is not synchronised. This is not a fault of the camera - the HD video files created (.MOV) are high quality and intact, you just need a high-quality media player to play them! Try GOM on a high-performance PC.  I play them back on the WDTV Media Player connected to my HDTV via HDMI after first converting the audio using the mov2avi utility.
9.0|#|Packed full of features. Images are of a very high quality. Camera itself looks classy. Very small in size but with an good sized LCD screen|#|A little bit expensive, camera didn't come with even a basic memory card
8.0|#|Really nice and sleek, lots of features crammed, great for photos for events etc|#|Should come with a carry case, had to buy my own spearately
10.0|#|Small, lightweight, large viewer, there's also a viewfinder for seeing subjects in bright light, great Canon lens quality.|#|The scenes cover most common things but there's no 'sport' mode, and no way of manually setting shutter speed or aperture.
9.0|#|I have adapted a belt pouch so I carry it with me all the time, even in work.|#|It is so portable and would be much more so with its own BELT pouch.
9.0|#|Quality of shots on automatic mode is brilliant. It is particularly good indoors and with portraits. The camera is stylish and attracts admiration. It has a viewfinder - a feature you don't usually get with such cameras.|#|Only 3x Optical zoom - but I realize this is a tradeoff between capability and size.

10.0|#|Excellnet compact camera - I love it!|#|The only problem I have is that the movie files are not saved as .mpegs. I  haven't worked out ow to view them on my computer yet.
8.0|#|Lots of automatic features that constantly adjust the settings for you (all you notice is the icons in the corner).|#|The menu control buttons maybe alittle too small for mansized figures.
10.0|#|The battery life is brilliant on it too - I have used it allot and only had to recharge once in the last 3 weeks.|#|Can't say I have come across any bad points!
9.0|#|It's a very good balance between size/zoom/other features and easy to carry around unobtrusively.|#|I would like a greater zoom range - sometimes but not at the cost of making it bigger and heavier

10.0|#|This camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures.|#|You must make sure you have a big memory card for this camera as it uses a lot of space for pics.  The downloading of photos to pc is easy but sorting photos into folders  takes a bit of thinking about.
9.0|#|great picture, fully auto for those who dont know how to operate a camera. decent enough video footage to get rid of exsisting camcorder.|#|software not as intuitive to use as previous ixus model but may improve with familiarity

9.0|#|exellent point and shoot compact amazing how much in so little camera|#|none
9.0|#|A neat compact little camera that doesn't have too many features to make it complicated. Great if you want a camera for taking holiday snaps that fits in your pocket.|#|
10.0|#|It was very simple  for me to use as I'm not a professional photographer.|#|I don't know yet about any bad point. The only thing I know is that I videoed  a bit and my card was full so quick. I thought the card was 4GB. My nephew will check it and let me know whether I filmed too much.

5.0|#|Good quality pictures|#|Cannot believe that I had to purchase a memory card.  Until I did I could not take any pictures.
8.0|#|Very light compact camera. Whilst it is not Canon's latest model, on average it produces excellent quality photos|#|The back coating on the camera has started to come of quicker than expected. Some images taken in low light are not clear on Auto setting
10.0|#|This is a great go-anywhere camera. Superbly portable and wonderful images - including reduced light. I have used it every day for 3 weeks on holiday and the battery was still almost full - after over 160 images. An excellent buy.|#|Can't think of one.

10.0|#|Will also record video in HD.|#|
10.0|#|Ideal for slipping into handbag or pocket, no bulk. Being a 'point and shoot' user it is very easy, However I have been tempted to experiment a little. Having a viewfinder was really important for me as I have difficulty with the screen when it is sunny. So far I am delighted with the camera.|#|The 'Getting Started' Manual was far too basic and the Manuals Disk for use with the computer was far too inconvenient for me to use, so my son downloaded and printed the much larger 'Camera User Guide' which was a lot more use to me. I haven't yet found any bad points with the camera.
9.0|#|Easy to carry.Tele photo good.Quality and photos very good.|#|On off button to awkward.View finder to small.Difficult to hold needs a case..
9.0|#|Compact, light weight. Has Auto ISO, HD video. For the amateur and as a tourist photography.|#|No RAW mode (though cannot expect it for this price). Continuous shooting mode has a delay between shots.
10.0|#|Great pictures, very compact and easy to carry.|#|Lots to learn on how to operate all the features. Small instruction booklet but full information on CD. Would like to be able to keep flash turned off for some photos but when you turn camera off and then on again the flash is automatically on.
9.0|#|Very compact and all in all takes a great photo.|#|When zooming in pictures become blurred.
10.0|#|Takes very good and fast photo's, perfect for my wife storing it in her handbag ready to take pics of the kids at the drop of a hat. If you are expecting a camera with slr like zoom etc then this won't be what you need, if however you want a good solid camera for taking quick photo's and that gives a good picture and is very compact then this one will fit the bill. Filled with good and well thought out features that some at twice the price struggle to have, excellent picture quality for such a small camera. It takes loads of photo's on one battery charge. All in all a good buy. I'd say the best camera in its range|#|None that I can think off, apart from the wife hides it in her handbag so I never get to use it!
7.0|#|value for money|#|apart from that its great little pocket camera.
9.0|#|The fact it is so small means you can pop it in your pocket and carry it around a;ll the time so I find myself taking much more pictures that I did with my old compact camera.|#|Controls might be a bit too small for someone with large hands, it may actually be 'too small' for some people.
9.0|#|all round performance|#|zoom and flash

8.0|#|Its very small for carrying around. Takes good pictures but havent used it enough to comment further|#|Being very small it is rather fiddly. That said I would buy it again.
9.0|#|Small, extremely portable yet still takes lovely pictures and preserves the manual settings that I love about Canon cameras.|#|Wish it were easier to find a case that matches it perfectly. The one that I got free with my camera (Swordfish) is great colour and of course, great quality, but just a little bit too big...
9.0|#|Sleek design.|#|Some images come out a bit more blurred than with other cameras and pictures take slightly longer to take.
9.0|#|good camera, good quality images, small and fits easily into any pocket, and good choice of features. brilliant for beginers with auto flash as it recognises images and faces. smart little thing. long battery life|#|the lid that closes the battery is fiddlely when closed.

8.0|#|I am very impressed and would highly recommend this to anyone! Worth every penny!|#|The only negatives i could mention is that if you wanted to use all the features of the camera, due to it's small size, the buttons are obviously very small so will be a tad fiddly. But in reality that is not what this camera is about, it takes good quality pictures without the need change settings for conditions. If that's what you want, this is the camera for you.

9.0|#|Very Compact with reasonable battery life and takes a decent picture. Has a view finder as well for sunny days on the ski slopes!|#|A manual focus would still be useful every once in a while.
9.0|#|Amazingly there are very few compact cameras now available with viewfinders. Anyone who has tried to take pictures outdoors cannot usually compose their picture without, even with additional shields (have noticed even canon is stopping this feature-which is stupid). Camera neat and compact. Not yet had a lot of use but have taken both still and video.|#|The viewfinder is good but it would be better if not quite as close to the edge of the body.
9.0|#|Great for travelling.  Fits into any pocket|#|Slightly disappointed with the quality but it is a small camera.
8.0|#|very little delay on shutter|#|
9.0|#|Great screen - no need for viewfinder after all.|#|Haven't found any yet!
8.0|#|Living in Malta with bright sunlight all year round, I needed a good camera with an optical viewfinder. This is the best I found in the category and the price range I was seeking.|#|I would have preferred a 5x optical zoom instead of 3x. This camera would have been the very perfect choice.
8.0|#|Great size, small and light.|#|Didn't come with case.

10.0|#|The camera is very handy, easy to use. I use it as a second camera to my DSLR. I don't always have the DSLR on me but the Ixus 100 is always in my pocket ready to shoot and I love it. I can take pictures whenever I need to and the quality is very good and it also features HD movies which is pretty impressive.|#|I was missing a SD card as part of the purchase but it seems to be standard that these are not included with the camera. Would be nice to have a kit with SD card so one is ready to shoot with the camera right out of the box.
9.0|#|I like the fact that it has a viewfinder.  I don't need to put my reading glasses on to take a picture and if it is very bright the screen is sometimes difficult to see.  Lovely photos particularly if subject is moving.  I took some great photos of my grand daughter jumping in the water on holiday.|#|The buttons are a bit small but with a tiny camera that is to be expected - I am glad I have stopped biting my nails!

8.0|#|Controls very easy to use.  On screen menu self explanatory.  Large display screen.  Zoom control incredibly easy to operate.  Picks out faces and shows green box around the central focussing element.  By moving the camera slightly, you can change where the camera focuses.  Excellent battery life.  Can see on screen how many shots you have left.  Instruction book very easy to understand.  Auto setting makes point and shoot very simple and produces excellent results.|#|Fireworks setting produces really weird visual effects.  For night time shots, pixels go down to 3mp.  Flash fires automatically on every setting unless you remember to cancel it.

9.0|#|As I expected from Nikon the camera is very good.  As it is my only camera it fits with my ability, and what I was prepared to spend. I also purchased a 18-200 VR lens to go with the camera.|#|None for me, I would have bought a D200 but it was to expensive for me.
10.0|#|Any hesitation to move from film to digital is blown away by this camera.|#|Worry about dust on the chips, but this would be with any dslr.

9.0|#|Picture Quality.  Robust Build.  Speed of Response.  LCD Monochrome Panel useful in bright light where the colour display is harder to see.|#|Fairly bulky and heavy.
10.0|#|Serious camera combines sophisticated SLR with powerful digital processing. Handles well, copes with everything from point and shoot to creative work.|#|None
8.0|#|Chunky, robust and high quality camera, easy to hold and use. We've got the ultra-wide angle lens fitted as an option, and the panorama shots are truly impressive. Large LCD screen for reviewing images, all the controls fall neatly to hand, and for the price, you get a lot of pixels for your money.|#|Can take ages to photograph a detailed shot - whether you've got noise reduction on or off, and whether you're in landscape or auto modes. You can't preview the shot on the LCD screen, so you have to use the viewfinder, and there's no way to turn off the shutter noise which makes it impractical for photographing conference speakers, for instance.
9.0|#|Big solid build.  Plenty of camera to hold onto if one has large hands. Very user friendly.  Very good quality pictures.|#|None apparent.
9.0|#|As you would expect with anything Canon it's fantastic, the build quality is spot on, no loose bits or things that just dont quite work. Mines been through the Sahara Desert, and always continues to do exactly what it says on the box.|#|If I had more money I'd buy the 5D or if I won the lottery I'd buy the 1DS

10.0|#|This is a great camera with excellence image quality and very simple to use, its also has a very large screen which with zoom and crop image features|#|I like the body of my old D70, the D80 is a smaller body which is suprising  with all the added extra features
9.0|#|among us. The ability to manipulate shots  after taking them  allows for errors when using non CPU lens.|#|none
8.0|#|It's a Nikon product which gives it a flying start. Layout and function are familiar from D50 experience. 10 Mpixel resolution is just right for my purposes to enable cropping of images and still be able achieve good sized prints. It has more facilities (D-lighting, extra focus points, etc.) than my previous D50 - with which I was very pleased.|#|Lack of anti-dust facilities as per D60 or Canon. Apart from that nothing (taking price into account).
9.0|#|brilliant clear photos|#|beware of slightest  knock have damaged the digital display
9.0|#|Good size display, excellent image quality, the overall weight and feel of the camera lets you know you are holding a good quality SLR.

10.0|#|The software suite with the camera is also very good although it isn't a photoshop.|#|Can't really think of anything except maybe a bit pricey and ocassionaly the autofocus goes a bit crazy -- but that's probably user error!
9.0|#|great camera excellent image quality|#|none

10.0|#|It's a professional camera, it takes professional pictures. It has a good solid feel. It does low light shots very well.|#|There is a tendency to overexposure on sunny days resulting in loss of detail, so you have to stop back a bit; this is more marked with the Nikon 50-200 mm lens than the Signa 28-50 mm.

4.0|#|It's quite a flexible camera.|#|The kit lens has poor glass, and it took four different tries before we found a 30D that didn't have dust caked on the CCD.
9.0|#|Great handling camera with plenty of great features for the discerning amatuer. Fantastic high ISO performance and image quality. The kit lens is an OK starter lens but to take advantage of the fantastic CMOS sensor, quality glass is recommended. I have the EF-S 17-55 f2.8 IS and EF 70-200 f4 IS which are ideal companions for walkabout. I also have some specialist primes for more creative shots. That's the big advantage of D-SLR|#|None for the price

9.0|#|Easy to use by a novice and a handy second hand camera for a DSLR user. Lots of manual control facilities for a pro user. Bright, accurate and large display - have not needed a view finder yet.|#|Grip is missing, may slip from hand if strap is not on. Did put a grip in my camera under Canon logo for safety. Does not have HD video (don't have a real need for it at the moment).
9.0|#|Love it! better than I was expecting. It takes a while to get use to the way it works but am really enjoying it and have no regrets of buying it.  Have recommended it to friends|#|
9.0|#|An excellent camera for those considering a compact camera to compliment their SLR, or someone wanting to experiment with more creative shooting modes (manual, aperture priority etc).|#|Expensive! However, not as pricey as a G11, and has the same sensor.
10.0|#|This is simply the best compact I have owned. I bought this as a companion to my DSLR and for shooting when I don't want to carry a lot of equipment.|#|It's a bit on the pricey side.
9.0|#|A digital camera with a high specification. It is small and compact so can replace a DSLR when it is not convenient to carry a heavy and larger camera. It produces pictures equaly as good  as a DSLR of similar specification and will even take RAW pictures which is certainly a plus for the experienced amateur. Although there is no view finder this is no disadvantage except in very strong sunlight. However the LDC screen is quite bright and works quite well in framing a shot. The zoom range is limited but easily controlled with the large ring around the lens.|#|There are few bad points such as the circular control on the back of the camera which can be moved accidentally when setting the rocker switch controls.  In the centre of all this is the function control wich is very small and needs care when operating it so that other switches are not altered. The cd which comes with the camera contains a very full instruction manual but has to be printed out as continual reference is necessary when first operating the camera. It would be helpful to have a full printed manual but that of course would add to the cost.
9.0|#|Great camera. For a small compact it takes fantastic quality pictures. Really, there is little you can't love about this camera.|#|Shame because otherwise, you can't fault this camera.
9.0|#|good size|#|slippery smooth outer surface makes it easy to drop
8.0|#|I like it very much... because it is light compare to G11/G10. It captures nice images..(it is good it focusing/sharp images) If you want a light camera ... this is for you.|#|
10.0|#|It also means I can now carry a camera everywhere I go.|#|I have also read reports that it is difficult to hold but I have no trouble. Maybe its just the Americans greasy fingers from all those fries!

10.0|#|everything|#|nothing
10.0|#|Very good performance under low light conditions|#|
8.0|#|Image quality is good bearing in mind this is a compact camera.  It is very compact and easily carried in a shirt pocket.  Battery life is good.  Low light level image quality is good , ISO 800 pictures are quite acceptable.  Makes a good second camera to partner a DSLR.|#|Small size means it's a bit tricky to use sometimes. Not that good on AUTO mode (tends to use too high ISO at expense of picture quality) really need to take more control with P, Tv or Av etc.  I set ISO to 80 and use P mode. Video quality only AVI so not up to latest HD.
8.0|#|Good Quality Pics. Worth its value.|#|Not a layman's product. Need to learn how to use it
9.0|#|Has a wide range of shooting styles and produces great photos.|#|No optical viewfinder.  Can be difficult to compose the picture in bright sun.
9.0|#|Love the massive zoom on this product, I now have massive picture of my work colleagues ear. It is easy to use, but still have enough override features.|#|Downside is I wouldn't like to drop it, the plastic case does look (though it could be) very durable.
9.0|#|It's easy enough to use and there's no faffing about with buttons if you don't want the flash on.  You just don't flip it up!|#|I haven't managed to find a sport function so don't know what it'll be like when I'm trying to photograph a moving target. .When downloading images the software makes a new folder for each day's photos and doesn't allow you to choose where you want them to go.

8.0|#|easy to use and light and flexible .feels comfortable.good all round camera.|#|power supply could have been stronger.
8.0|#|Very impressed with the results, especially with using the Manual setting.|#|The biggest draw-back with this is that it eats up batteries. It takes only 2 AAs (my previous Canon had 4) and even Duracells lasted only a day or two on holiday. Rechargables are obviously the ones to use with this model. Also, when uploading the photos onto computer using the software provided, changing the target directory and generic image nameis very fiddly. The software with my previous Canon allowed the user to change both directly from the import dialog.

9.0|#|Really good quality and easy to use.  We haven't learned a fraction, yet, of the camera's capabilities, but we are very impressed.  The camera is a really good bridge between an SLR and compact.|#|Not easy to see the image on the screen in sunlight, so taking photos can be a bit of a lottery - made worse by my photo-chromic glasses.  A little pull-out awning over the screen  might take care of this
9.0|#|excellent image quality and 10x zoom. Loads of features including manual control.  Small enough to fit in your bag and good size screen.  Very good value for money compared to similar spec compacts.|#|Would have liked a view finder as sometimes its difficult to see the image on the screen without getting a reflection.  A bit difficult to open battery compartment quickly !

9.0|#|It does everything that the 50D does but has the video option which is fantastic. I didnt realise that you can also take a still photo whilst in video mode until I read the manual. The quick control screen is a major bonus over my old 350D. Being able to change ISO, Image quality and metering in seconds really helps with my nature and bird photography. Although the build quality is not the same as the 50D its lightness helps when carrying all my lenses with tripods when birding.|#|Only one. Why does the flash pop up in good light whilst in automatic mode. I still havent figured out how to stop it. Can anyone help.
9.0|#|provides common (or difficult to find) options quickly. Creative modes allow beginners to use it as well as more experienced users. Excellent screen display and resolution. Resdesigned grip is excellent. Depth of Field setting provides quite good results, but usually badly fails to include all captured focussing points when using flash.|#|Live View is fiddly and not quick to focus. 20fps on HD video is sadly short of 30fsp, but its OK I guess? High ASA settings negated by Auto Picture corrections (in Custom Functions), meaning limit on ASA top settings. Why on earth Canon decided to put the video start/stop button separate to the shutter release I don't know!
9.0|#|The quality of image, High ISO level in dark conditions and HD movie are the strengths of this product|#|I am still looking for...
8.0|#|Very small and light comapred to my main 5D Mark II body, easy to use, favourites menu, built in flash.|#|Reduction in resolution and contrast is noticeable compared to 5DII, but as it is less than a third of the price, this has to be taken into account.  Personally I  would only use the 500D up ISO800.
9.0|#|It continues the build quality that I have learnt to expect from Canon|#|doesn't always present information in logical sequence. There are occasional instances of a lack of familiarity with standard english.
9.0|#|Ease of use,  fairly intuitive controls,  large high-def screen.  I bought this to replace an ageing EOS300D which was brilliant,  except that with slightly failing eyesight the controls and indicators were getting a bit difficult to read.  The large display on the 500D  is a major improvement in that respect.|#|A bit flimsier than the 300D....  fingernails seem to mark the plastic near the handgrip quite easily.... only a cosmetic thing,  though.
10.0|#|I can still use my original lenses from the 350D so it has saved me money.   It is very simple to use and the photographs are outstanding when viewed either on the computer or TV screen through the DVD player.|#|None that I have found
9.0|#|Fantastic screen, good photo image quality|#|None found yet
10.0|#|Allows you to point and shoot with very little set up but also has the capability to let you select all settings manually. With the addition of Full HD video makes it a very comprehensive and versatile camera for the price. Also will take all EF/EFS lenses|#|LCD display is fixed in the back which restricts its use but is viewable at an angle which helps a bit but a fully articulated screen would have made the camera unbeatable at the price.

9.0|#|I have been using the 400D for 3 years, and have found that the upgrade to the 500D is currently good value. I wanted the extra quality of 14 bits rather than 12, and the extra few mega pixels. I also wanted to move to SD cards. Live view and camcorder modes are not essential to me, but work pretty well and are a nice bonus. I also think that some of the menu options have been improved, and I like the addition of spot metering. I have played with the raw images in Adobe Camera Raw, and the improved quality has so far not disappointed.|#|The battery life is not as good as previous models, and I'm not sure why the button for switching between metering modes has been relegated to a menu option. This is something that I use often, so this is slightly iritating.

9.0|#|Having previously purchased a 450D, the extra features of the 500D justified the purchase of  the 500 D body. The extra pixels, the extra range of ISO and the option to use as a cam 'corder proved excellent value for money.  Not only that but I could now keep my canon 17 - 40 mm lens on one body and my Tamron 18 - 270 mm lens on the other body. Allowing me the option of lens without the interchangable aspect.|#|None, only regret not getting the 500D sooner.

Good features for a compact camera and I would recommend it.|#|We bought a case with the camera to match the body.  Unfortunately the case is a shade of blue which is good for girls, but not blokes if you know what I mean.

Overall happy with the results.|#|Only thing I have noticed is that sometimes there is a red line on the LED screen - don't know if I should be worried about this but it only occurs occasionaly and disappears again.
9.0|#|Its a very good buy for somebody that needs an everyday digital camera that doesnt cost a fortune. It takes quality pictures day and night (brightest sunshine and nightclubs) even on auto, saving the hassle of messing around with the ISO. The images dont come out blurry (and im an amateur) and are best when the flash is on (even during the day). Close up images (flowers, any people that try semi-professional nice pictures from an angle or just focusing the front bit of the image) are absolutely amazing. The wide lense is a lovely feature, even I wasnt expecting to make such a nice difference. Would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera for everyday/holiday use, Im sure its nothing you will regret!|#|8 on image quality), though that might be due to only standard auto settings I use, as I tend to prefer the point-and-shoot. More features/functions might be more fun, though for the cost it is a good selection.
9.0|#|For price, this camera offers an excellent alternative to more expensive brands which do basically the same thing. It's small, compact and versatile with good image quality. Feature menus are well set out making quick adjustments to your image easy.|#|In low light quality the image quality suffers a little. However, with a more thorough understanding of the camera features this can probably be overcome.

8.0|#|A highly versatile camera, with many of the same features available on the 'higher end' 7D semi-pro model. I was planning on purchasing the 7D, but having felt the sheer weight of this camera and compared the spec with that of the 550D, only the shooting speed and minor differences in sensor processing seem different to me. The lighter body of the 550D, and much lighter price, swayed me. Whilst the top dial presets suggest it is marketed as a 'beginner' dslr, there is plenty for the more serious amateur to get to grips with. Indeed, the fact that I haven't really captured the quality of photo I was hoping for as yet suggests that 'tweaking' is an important skill to get the best from it.|#|Not sure the quality of the kit lens is a match for the quality of the camera. I'm a little disappointed at the results indoors, where I thought the DSLR would really shine over my little FUJI, but there isn't that much difference. I'm considering splashing out on a better lens (as I saved several hundreds of pounds against the 7D), such as the 1.4 50mm, or even the 'cheapy' 1.8 50mm - which I hope will generate even better results, especially of portraits of my family.
9.0|#|Great Camera, very pleased!!!|#|Finding a good memory card that can handle the HD video speed - I bought a new Samsung 16GB SDHC class 6 card (550D (Canon) said the card had to be a minimum class 6) the card worked great for stills but was not fast enough for video. I have now purchased a Transcend 16GB class 10 SDHC - internet reviews indicate this card can handle the video so lets wait and see, in short check the cards are proven to handle HD video in 550D before purchase just any old class 6 card may not work!
10.0|#|Solid, well designed camera with the feel of a great film camera.  Great viewfinder.  Really like the sensor that makes the rear viewfinder picture image disappear when you put the camera to your face. Quality of the lens and the images are extraordinary.   Loads and loads of clever features which will take me months to work through.  I was an avid Film EOS user, and am really pleased so far with this new digital version.|#|None
9.0|#|The Canon EF-S 18-135 Lens is a reasonable good all rounder, especially when on holiday.|#|The Canon 550D does not have a swing out LCD viewing screen which makes low level photography difficult, unless you buy an additional viewing screen.
9.0|#|Battery life is also excellent.|#|Shame the rear screen doesnt come with a screen protector, but thats easily rectified with aftermarket ones available
9.0|#|Having previously purchased the Canon 300D and 400D cameras, I had no reservation in purchasing the 550D as an upgrade. The camera produces outstanding performance with ultra crisp sharpness. I was very surprised at the quality of the images from 6400ASA setting which corresponded to that from the 800ASA setting on the 400D. All the features are ergonomically laid out for ease of operation and no twitching fingers which could unintentionally change the ASA setting as on the 400D.|#|The battery and memory card are not interchangeable with the 400D but are of superior quality, otherwise I can't fault the product.
9.0|#|The camera is very fast to operate in manual mode with nice clear menus and display. Although I found I use it most in aperture priority mode.  The bundled 18-55mm lens is better than expected too.  I bought it with this lens as I can't afford the lens I really want yet and thought this would get me started. I was very impressed with it.|#|mode it's slower than I expected for still images because the mirror has to lift out of the way so I don't use that feature except when shooting video.
10.0|#|The performance across the range is at the point where the most important/limiting thing that effects the photographs that you take is the lens not the camera itself -- save on the body by buying the 550D and put the money towards 'L' series lenses!|#|(Portrait, Landscape etc) ones
10.0|#|The video quality is great although it can be a bit tricky at times.|#|Also when shooting using the built in mic you get the noises of the lense and focusing picked up in the film.
9.0|#|manufacturing methods. After over five decades of serious commitment to the chemical process and to low tech, high build quality, equipment, I took some winning over to the value of the digital process. The 550D is not just a high tech lump of plastic, as I would so often regard such kit, but has the potential for serious image production. Once I accepted that it is not a Lieca, a Hassle, or a Broni, I was able to settle down to some serious photography.|#|What am I to do, now, with the darkroom ?

10.0|#|So versatile. A good mid-range camera with excellent still and movie capabilities. Compares very well with the direct competition.|#|Intensive instruction booklet.

10.0|#|having used a hybrid DSLR / Compact style camera for the last 3 years (Panasonic DMC-FZ18) i needed to upgrade to a better more professional style DSLR camera, and this fits the bill perfectly.  It has great ability to control every aspect of each shot to the finest of changes in Exposure, DOF, Focus, Flash adjustments which makes taking photos a lot more fun as the result can be viewed using the DOF preview button before you click.  I have not used the on-screen preview as i prefer using the eye-piece.  This camera has taken my photography skills and results to a higher level.|#|the on-body lenses are very expensive and can cost as much as the camera did for the mid-range models.  i wish the kit lens had a longer zoom length as this is something i really miss from my old camera.

Was going to buy when it first came out but decided to soldier on with the excellent 350D and wait for the price to reduce. When it did, I bought it and have been more than impressed, especially in low light conditions.|#|Still trying to find one!
9.0|#|An awesome entry-level DSLR with a great kit lens.  The body and lens is of a good build quality.  The menu system is simple, with many beginner and more advanced features.  The LCD is large, bright and crystal clear.|#|I recommend purchasing the Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS telephoto lens, as the EF-S 18-55mm IS kit lens is only suitable for portrait and wide-angle shots.  The built-in flash is also not great (but this is the same with all DSLRs), and you might want to purchase a separate flash unit.
9.0|#|If you have had a Canon before it's like meeting an old friend who has had a makeover. Very easy to use, clear menus, lovely to hold.|#|I can't think of any, its a fab camera in the price range. The kit lens is a bit limiting but most people have/buy other lens to go with it.

10.0|#|image quality is on par with the canon 7d, hd video is great.  typical canon menu system, works well.  quite a light camera, so maybe a battery pack would give better balance for some.  doesnt have the build quality and weight of the 7d and comparible camera - but then it costs a huge amount less.  somewhat smaller than 7d and similar too, but this isnt necessarily a bad thing.  all in all brilliant cam for the money, punches well above its weight, iso noise control is astounding.|#|none

And it also produce a good video. I intend to use the camera for photos only but sometimes you really can capture precious moment with a great video which is very handy with this model. Price-wise, i think i got myself a bargain.|#|Why did canon name the same camera in different country. 550d in UK and T-rebel for USA. It just confusing for us amateur whos looking for a descent dslr.
10.0|#|The screen menu and buttons are easy to use/ navigate for an amaetuer like myself and the jog dial is excellent. Produces very good quality images.|#|However, I also use a 55-250 mm IS lens and focusing at the telephoto end might be a liitle slow for just point an shoot- which I assume is expected I suppose.

Whilst the EOS600d was also available this was much more expensive for little gain (flexible lcd screen). Overall very satisfied with 5550d. Easy to use, great picture quality and lots of manual options to explore.|#|Build quality is ok but slightly plasticky. Overall feels like it can take the odd knock or two. Much better builder quality than 1100d.
10.0|#|New metering mode gives really good white balance, compare to my old DSLR. High ISO, which makes picture fully usable/printable even with slow shutter speed. Gotta say, the kit lens really surprised me. I was expecting it to be completely useless, but it's quite good. What about movie mode, it shoots 1080p videos 24/25/30 fps - what else you need?! The best thing about 550D is it's price.|#|Built quality. But no, don't imagine that it's made out of CocaCola bottle, like I did before i took it to my hands. The worst thing about the built quality to me is probably main dial's, reduce/magnify buttons and maybe (not sure) even shutter button quality. Talking about the video mode, well there's no continuous AF during filming and the mic catches every little noise from the camera itself, like manual focusing. But all these flaws comes to a body/it's built quality. Note that I couldn't find any cons in picture/video quality or camera performance.

10.0|#|I love the combination of the EOS 550D with the 18 - 135mm lens.  This is fine for most situations, an avoids the need for too many lens changes.  (The image quality is good enough to do any further zooming later digitally)|#|It's a bit heavy, but no more so than any SLR with a similar lens

9.0|#|The camera is quite easy to use, and also not too heavy to carry around.|#|I haven't really used it enough yet but one thing that does annoy me is that if you are using some of the different modes like close-ip, it doesn't seem possible to turn off the flash which is really annoying.
9.0|#|Everything!|#|Nothing yet
8.0|#|A lot of features, good step up from earlier models.|#|Body is plastic and feels cheap.  Expensive for the quality of the body
10.0|#|Very easy and intuative for a point and shoot/keen amateur user. I love the image quality and my partner loves the noise it makes on continuous shoot!|#|Haven't found one yet but then I'm mainly using it in auto mode just now.
9.0|#|Lightweight, good build quality, good photos and video, included kit lens are very light and the image quality is acceptable, the only extra required to start taking pictures is a SD card|#|Nothing wrong with the product, but a few extra accessories would be nice (bag, extra battery)
9.0|#|I had my 1000d stolen and up graded to 550d. the picture quality is so much bettet. I'm very new to cameras and not used all the features yet. The 18-135 lens is the best thing ever.|#|have none so far

9.0|#|- Well built.|#|- Also the lens you get in the bundle isn't great, but once you buy a slightly more expensive lens there isn't really anything to complain about.
8.0|#|really super, fairly compact camera -can't go wrong with the automatic setting, so you get great quality pictures immediately while you learn how to use the other functions properly|#|not a bad point but a wish that perhaps you could offer a left handed version! Find it slightly awkward to focus with my right hand....but getting better with practice
10.0|#|This is my first DSLR and it's a great camera, easy to use, build quality as expected of a Canon product.|#|None so far!
8.0|#|Really good mid-range Canon DSLR, fairly easy to use and change settings. You can get some cracking images once you get used to customising and working in the various modes.|#|The build quality doesn't feel excellent to me, also the prices aren't what Id call truly reflective for a mid-range DSLR.

10.0|#|Picture quality at all levels|#|None as yet
9.0|#|The camera is also lightweight and relatively compact.|#|The zoom is not that great if you want to take shots of something in the distance. I'd recommend buying a larger lens in addition (and its worth spending a bit extra for an IS lens).
10.0|#|Excellent brand (of course). Being a total beginner I find the many auto settings invaluable. Of course as experience is gained the many personalised settings can then be utilised. This means great photos can be taken almost immediately, without having to wade through a comprehensive instruction manual.|#|None.
9.0|#|User friendly, with a vast array of features that you would find on a more expensive mid entry camera. Video mode is exceptional with the ability to create quite stunning broadcast quality creations|#|I had the misfortune to drop my camera only 4 days after recieving it and although it was in a camera bag, the front piece below the flash broke off and the flash is smashed. I can only use the cameras with high iso until I can get an external flash or try to get it fixed.

8.0|#|Feels good to use - as a totally amateur user I could pick it up, set it to auto and take some really good looking pics.|#|Manual is very difficult for a raw beginner
10.0|#|Has a CA screen where you can easily get to a variety of changes in one screen in cases where you need to take different photos quickly.|#|Flap over connection doesn't look like it'll last long.
10.0|#|As an amateur, this camera is very easy to use and photographs look very professional. Swapping between manual and auto is very simple|#|Sometimes the auto focus can take a while and if there is not enough lighting, it occasionally refuses to take a photograph but I am sure I will find a setting that prevents this.

9.0|#|EXCELLENT CAMERA, easy to use and gives professional pictures.|#|Did not realise i had to buy memory card in addition.
9.0|#|Great Bundle.  The 550 D is much better value than 600 which has only marginally better features.  The EF-S 18 -135 lense  is great walk about lense|#|18-135 Lense should have better definition but could not afford the 24-105 professional lense at 800 euro
8.0|#|Love the manual focusing as very quick!|#|The auto focusing can sometimes take long and decides not to take the photograph.
10.0|#|bought this for my trip to the states and have no regret took over 2000 pictures. once you use an SLR all other cameras seem useless|#|sometimes depending on lighting the camera takes a while to focus and you can miss your window of capturing a picture, but im sure with more superior lenses its even better.
8.0|#|Très bon objectif, qualité de photo vraiment extra|#|Aucun
8.0|#|The camera is great, very happy!|#|It doesn't come with a memory card which means you can't use it straight away. Also unless you have a good knowledge of real photography, you will need a book to help with fully utilising the camera.
10.0|#|Very good starter SLR camera recommended to beginners.|#|None

9.0|#|Ease of use, handling and picture quality|#|cost!
9.0|#|The Camera is excellent alrounder|#|Price has decreased a lot since before Xmas
8.0|#|Overall an excellent Camera. Feels more substantial in your hands than a 600D. Excellent screen. Well laid out menu controls.The camera will easily take more than 400 pictures in raw format on a single battery. The 17-85mm kit lense is ok and seems sharpest around 50 mm.|#|To do that you'll need to buy a decent prime lense. When you see the output from that combination, it will put a smile on your face.
9.0|#|It is an excellent camera for the serious hobbyist - the camera feels solidly built, picture quality is very good even under some difficult cinditions, the burst speed for sports shots is impressive!|#|Not so much a bad point but more  a sign of how much a novice I am, it is less than intuitive to find some of the settings and quite often you have to trog through menus to find what it is you wish to adjust. It is expensive and hence not as good value for money as it might have been, particularly with the 600D coming onto the market - I did consider this but prefer the weight and features of the 60D.
9.0|#|A very good camera with a nice feel about it, easy to use and good instruction book|#|
9.0|#|I am used to using a full Pro body( Nikon D2xs and Nikon D3) but I didn't need these any more and made the move to This canon!! Not something I am regretting! Great Camera!|#|It is a plastic body, which while still robust, is not as reassuring as a magnesium body which I am used to. If you want a magnesium alloy body, buy yourself the 7D
10.0|#|series lens on it.  Flip screen has it uses when you need to hold the camera up high to get a shot.  Camera can turn RAW into JPEGs and can fire most canon flashes remotely.|#|
9.0|#|Although its a higher level DSLR than the entry level cameras it doesnt confuse the amateur user but enables you to learn more complex features and produce better pictures.|#|
9.0|#|Great images. Easy to use. I can still use my older Canon lenses which saved me a lot of money.|#|Nothing but I've a lot to learn with this new camera.
8.0|#||#|These are really quite minor issues though, the camera is still an amazing bit of kit, possibly not worth upgrading from a similar or recent model but from a 20D, oh yes, do it, now.
8.0|#|It's my first dSLR and I love it. Everything is fantastic, right down to battery life.|#|Can't decide which lens to get next.

8.0|#|no  doubt about the product which is good i have been using it from last four months|#|
9.0|#|I have achieved good audio by attaching a Zoom H2n via its headphone socket to the 3.5mm mic socket on the camera. By fiddling with the camera's manual gain, and the Zoom H2n's headphone volume, I was able to match the audio meter on the Zoom with that on the camera. This way I can still monitor audio levels while shooting video (using the Zoom), even though the camera won't let you see its audio meter while shooting.|#|3. an xlr input offering phantom power, not just a 3.5mm mic socket
10.0|#|Good balence and body shape. Higher quality at higher ISO values allowing for faster shutter speeds in low light. 18-55mm lens has been improved and has a more solid feel which is better on manual focus setting.|#|Lock on exposure setting control seems unnecessary but not a big problem.
9.0|#|Good image and video quality. Good build quality too for the money.|#|Lens EF-S 18-55mm IS have poor build quality.

1.0|#|None|#|The charger will not work
10.0|#|I purchesed the Cannon SX210 IS to provide an alternative to my SLR and it does that with style. It's compact size gives easy yet professional performance. It is fun to use because the range of features offers the opportunity to shoot in all conditions without having to spend valuable time 'setting up'. Offering the settings choice of 'easy shot' and 'auto' as well as manual really does give this camera a powerfull edge. I love it's descreate size which makes you feel comfortable in crowded places. It's just packed with user friendlineness and photographic features all at a very competative price.|#|None!
9.0|#||#|Despite this, a great camera!
10.0|#|Oh yes - 720p video what more can you want.  My Sony HD Camcorder is getting worried now!!|#|Small niggle re the popup flash being right under the position where I naturally want to put my left index finger when holding the camera.  In reality I'm getting used to this and you can keep your finger down holding the flash back - manual says this is ok.
10.0|#|The 14x is fantastic. Fantastic picture quality. My son doesn't sit still for 10seconds so getting a pictureof him that isn't blurred is a struggle - my Nikon coolpix  was never up to the job (or maybe my photography skills weren't) but this Canon is just perfect on Auto and there's just never a blur. The red-eye reduction feature works a treat - it's not the double flash, it actually has a feature that finds red-eye after the photo is taken and removes it for you in the photo. I'm still getting used to all the features (eg panoramic stitching) so having it work well on Auto is a relief. There's lots of comments on here about the positioning of the flash but you get used to it, and if you have your finger holding it  down by mistake you can easily flick the flash back up manually - not an issue at all.|#|I'm really struggling to find my way around the camera. This is partly due to still after 3 wks of owning it not having had a chance to go through the manual, and partly due to the number of features that lead you off in various directions as you play with them. But really if you're paying this much for a camera you need to invest the time in understanding the more detailed functions so I know I'll get there when I have a moment.
10.0|#|Can be used in manual or automatic.|#|Flash pops up atomatically every time you switch on.
10.0|#|Simple point and shoot with a degree of flexibility for creativity. Fantastic zoom yet still retaining adequate quality at max zoom. Bought as a back up to my DSLR's but seems to be supplanting them.|#|Minor niggle - have to view through rear screen - no visual viewfinder which can be difficult in certain circumstances.
10.0|#|Its extremely easy to use, all functions are easy to follow, its just so easy to get to know your camera, it has a few extra functions that my XS200 dos'nt have  which makes going from framed pictures to moving pictures without having to change.|#|On and off button a bit to small or in the wrong place, if you have long nails or big fingers its a bit of a struggle to turn it on, but thats all.
9.0|#|Point and shoot! Good image quality.|#|Also, the camera does not feel very ergonomically comfortabe to hold.
10.0|#|I LOVE IT!|#|Dial to select scene option is irritating as very bulky - the options could have been done using a menu option
9.0|#||#|The camera is quite heavy compared to other compacts.
9.0|#|Just slips into your pocket so you can take it anywhere........surprising performance and easy to use|#|Great zoom but wide angle is limited
10.0|#|Superb pictures.  The people at Canon really made this to be a great camera.|#|A bit narrow to be held easily, and it's too easy to accidentally disable the flash by bumping it.
9.0|#|The image quality is fantastic! The pictures take every little detail of the object you are taking a photo of. Even when you use the video part of the camera, it still keeps the same high level of quality. The zoom is absolutely fantastic as well! Could not believe that I could still take such a sharp picture of an object so far in the distance. Also, I love the feature that automatically takes a picture of you when you smile! Absolutely fab.|#|I can understand what people are saying about the flash on the camera, however it's so easy to adjust to! The flash doesn't have to be up all the time, obviously unless it is needed.
10.0|#|Very good value for money.|#|There isn't any really - the only thing is possibly - if you plan to take a few videos carry a spare battery as that really drains the battery.
8.0|#|This is an easy to use camera which gives good results in even quite poor light.  Excellent focusing system.|#|Although the screen is large, the image does not fill the screen so it might as well be smaller (I ordered it for the bigger screen!)  I also feel that this camera needs a viewfinder - used in bright light, it's quite difficult to see the screen.
9.0|#|Just about all of it. I love that it turns on and it ready to take pictures really quickly. You do have to take time to learn it, but that is not a bad thing as there are so many features. However, it functions really well as a point and shoot too so you really get the best of all worlds. Also, I have had mine for a while, taken loads of photos and videos, done loads of playback and still on the first charge of the battery. All good!|#|Only learning to move your finger off the flash when you turn it on, and really that is not difficult to do.
9.0|#|Great as a day to day camera for concerts etc|#|Flash is located in top left hand corner which can be annoying as this is normally where i hold the camera
10.0|#|It is very easy to use and has so many features that make it seem like a 'big' camera but this fits easily in a handbag or pocket.  I love it the more I use it.|#|ummmmm.....................can't think of any yet!
9.0|#|Solid built Canon product with easy use, excellent features as per other Canon cameras. I also own and use two Canon non digital SLRs|#|On/off button small and awkward to operate for big hands. Takes some time to get used to holding the camera without covering the flash when switching on.
10.0|#|Amazing zoom quality and  many features that make taking great photos easy.|#|The pop up flash takes some getting used to as it is just where you want to hold the camera.
10.0|#|Image quality and close focusing,I do a lot of flower studies and this camera is ideal for this. Ease of carrying, I am used to the weight of an SLR Canon, 450D, so this new toy is far more convenient, and less heavy, in use.|#|None really, getting used to a new way of holding the camera was a problem but I am coping quite well and the results are more than acceptable.
9.0|#|compact, loads of features (still yet to find them all), very easy to use and great zoom!|#|Flash a little annoying when turn on, finger stops it opening. But I knew this when I bought it, just takes getting used to.
8.0|#|Exelent manual functions which are very easy to navigate. I like that when you change the settings manually, that you can see the adjustment as you look through the screen. The camera does not have a view finder so you use the display screen as a view finder which is great as it gives you more freedom when taking photos. It is a nice size camera and feels sturdy, the image quality is excellent aswell as having excellent quality video. I have to say im a happy snapper with this one :)|#|The zoom button is a bit fiddly and the flash is in a bit of an inconvienient place but to be honest the good points far outweigh these small bad points
9.0|#|Durable and attractive with many excellent features. Love the way when you view images the screen changes from landscape and portrait.|#|Loading software for a camera is a bit of a nuisance!!
10.0|#|i am a novice at taking photos, but even my photos look good. the picture quality is fantastic and i and playing around with it rying different things and enjoying myself|#|the bad points are the flash. every time i turn the camra on i leave my finger on the flash and it dosent pop up. i know i should not put my finger there but its when im holding the camra with my left hand and turning it on with my right it happens. and only with this camra.
10.0|#|various lenses.|#|I find menus somewhat confusin,but I suppose I`ll get used to them..As all previous reviews I`ve read,the flash is poorly positioned
7.0|#|easy to get started, zoom does what it says, pictures are good.|#|Camera is not easy to hold, or get a grip on, its very slim, shiny and slippery! The on/off bottom is so small it needs a fingernail to 'touch' it on/off and hard to find by touch; also the shoot button is not so easy to find by touch. Camera good for young, nimble fingers, but not having those any more I would have preferred a camera that was more sturdy to hold when shooting, and buttons more clearly defined.
9.0|#|Amamzing photo|#|I'd perfer a better manual or DVD to teach me how to use the camera to its maximum.
8.0|#|Surprisingly powerful optical zoom.  Overall picture quality very good with natural colours.  Contrary to some reviewers, I rather like the pop-up flash as you can be sure it won't flash by mistake if the unit is not allowed to pop up.|#|The Jessops own brand case that came with the bundle is a disaster because of the large velcro pad on it.  The hooks of the velcro embed themselves in the rather silky strap that comes with the camera and has almost destroyed it.  Not a good design and I have had to remove the velcro.
10.0|#|Has the feel of a quality product as soon as you pick it up, but compact enough to carry around in your pocket. It has masses of features, which I am still learning about, but it is as easy or as complicated as you want it to be. It has an automatic setting if you just want to point and shoot, or it has all the manual settings for light, shutter speed etc. plus it has various integral colour filters. Great value little camera.|#|None, that I have found.
8.0|#|white function but hey, you can't have it all.  It's sometimes too quick for me, so it takes abit of getting used to if you're an amateur like me.  Well worth it though.|#|w function would've been the icing on the cake :o)

10.0|#|there are no gimmicks....it is easy to use. I bought this product as a gift,so the package with the extra battery was extremely useful. Also to add to this package, I want to purchase an underwater housing as the recipient wants to use when diving.|#|I desperately want to buy the underwater housing.....However the advert promoting it implies that the housing is not waterproof!!!  I would appreciate advice please.

10.0|#|The HD video quality is really good u can zoom right in as far as it will go and you don't loose any of the quality.|#|the camera is not very good at night time ( if ur at a concert) if the room is dark with flashing lights. Just doesn't focus very well
8.0|#||#|Disappointed that no instruction manual was provided in ENGLISH yet instruction manuals provided in Finnish, Swedish, Danish. The camera came with a 3 pin UK style plug so why no instructions in ENGLISH. It is a menace to have to refer to the English version online instead of having a handy booklet.
8.0|#|Provides detail on screen for the different shooting modes so you don't need to keep referring to the manual. Well worth using these to get the advantage of the setting in differing conditions.|#|The manual could be better quality printing and paper for a digital camera in this price range and quality.
9.0|#|Brilliant zoom, fits in my handbag, full manual capability|#|Some of the dial combinations are not intuitive.  Tendency to hold where pop-up flash is housed!

Good battery and recharger, especially as included with the product.|#|mode, rather than retaining the full picture view - very disappointing and very annoying.  I think the camera is somewhat overpriced for what it offers.  Compared to the SX120 IS, the SX210 IS is sadly lacking and I would not recommend this particular camera.  The SX120 IS is a far better camera and exceptionally good value for money.
10.0|#|Bought it for my mum - she is not very good with cameras. But this one was easy to use, with good quality pictures and video - everything she needed. Plus, the screen is bright and big!|#|The flash is definitely in the wrong place. You want to put your finger there when you hold the camera.

The life of the battery is quite good. But i bought an extra one in any case. There is so many good things about this camera. You have to try it. I recommend to everyone who enjoying amateur and home photography.|#|I didn't find any and i hope i wont.

9.0|#|Very impressive features and size for a 14x zoom camera. Ideal if you want to go out without too much stuff, just put it your pocket! With a camera this good, you don't need a DSLR unless you're a pro really. I'm still finding features I didn't realise it had.|#|The hand strap seems very prone to snagging on the velcro parts of my Lowepro pouch. Even after a couple of snags it's not looking like it will keep its form for long and it's quite difficult to pull it off the velcro without causing any damage. But it's only a strap!

9.0|#|Good quality images for a compact camera. Once you get the settings right you can happily use it on full auto, semi auto or manual. Built in flash is suitable for most uses. Lens goes from fairly wide to super zoom (~28mm-400mm in 35mm terms). Overall this is a suitable replacement for my DSLR when a SLR is too big to carry.|#|Anything above 400 ISO is pretty unusable. Manual settings are tricky, and manual flash power setting requires going into a menu - I've found myself using one of the auto scene modes for dark environments like bars and clubs. No 2-second review in anything but auto mode!! Flash pops up right under where your left index finger naturally sits.

8.0|#|My 'main' camera is a Pentax K-m DSLR, but I often find it too bulky to lug about, which is why I wanted a good quality compact to go with it. I was attracted to the SX210 IS by the long lens and good reviews, so I took the plunge. I never use the 'auto ISO' setting, as higher ISOs always have too much of a negative effect on picture quality. Set to ISO 80, the picture quality is so good in good light, that it is almost on a par with my Pentax. Considering the sensor on the Pentax is around 13 times bigger than on the Canon, this is a quite astonishing result and significantly better than any other compact with a similar size sensor that I have ever owned. I have always found the 'in camera special effects' to be a waste of time in the past, but several on the SX210 IS are genuinely good and combined with that long telephoto lens, really makes we want to get out and find things to photograph in a way I haven't felt for a while now, which is great.|#|Now the negatives, the biggest of which by far is the video quality, which is so poor as to be almost shockingly bad. Maybe it's the bad, dull weather recently forcing the camera to select a high ISO (you can't set it manually in video mode) but I've checked it over and over again to make sure it is actually on the HD setting (it is). Colours are dull and lifeless, detail is simply non existent and both focus and exposure are all over the place: unless you or your subject are static, the focus spends longer than it should 'hunting' and auto exposure is set way too high, so everything looks over-bright and washed out. HD video was certainly not the main reason I bought this camera, but it was one of the influencing factors and the fact that it is all but unusable is very disappointing. Battery power: I've taken around 160 shots so far (mostly photos + a few short videos) and the battery is now reading low - sometimes capacity increases after a few charge cycles and I can only hope that will happen here, as 160 shots is really not good. Awkward to hold: I may just need to get more used to it, but the sleek design, big screen and pop up flash position doesn't leave much to comfortably hold on to.

8.0|#|Simple to use.   The automatic lens cover is a great feature as it means no separate cap to keep hold of.   The Panorama featuere is also very easy to use and very effective.|#|The camera takes a couple of seconds to confirm its auto-focus, so if you are too 'snap-happy' you can get some blurred pictures.
10.0|#|the photographs taken on auto are fantastic. Very few red eye photos and the quality of the prints from the camera is great. I havent had time to read any of the book so just put it to auto and point and shoot - took fantastic photos of our daughter's wedding. Would thoroughly recommend it. I have always used Canon Ixus cameras and still have an Ixus 915 which is a great wee camera and I was worried about this one being a lot bulkier. It is not a problem and the quality of the photos make any difference in size irrelevant.|#|None that I have discovered so far

8.0|#|Excellent features in a compact digital camera. The powerful 14X optical zoom is rivaless in this class of cameras. The disign is also very attractive. Probably the best compact digital camera for this price range.|#|Although this camera features a big LCD display, the entirety of this big screen is not utilised the playback stills. The flash pops up when you power up the camera regardless of the ambient light level. The body of the camera looks very plasticy. This sort of minimizes the capability of such powerful camera.

The build quality is good - but it isnt stylish and a bit of a lumpy piece of kit when compared to similar and equally capable cameras. Shame its only available in black as the look of it would be enhanced if it were available in silver.

10.0|#|Viewfinder - 2.7 inch LCD screen - general handling i.e. easy to get a good grip; the raised area on the front is ideally shaped for you to lock your index finger on.   This also acts as an anchor and helps keep the camera steady.|#|Only one - zoom limitations.   It is difficult to judge the amount of zoom to create the perfect composition.   I am guessing practice makes perfect!

8.0|#|Easy to use and user friendly|#|The number of shots i was told the battery could take wasnt what it turned out to be. Took less than 45shots within a week,and the battery went flat
9.0|#||#|The basic controls are in a Getting Started booklet, but the User Guide is on CD which I don't find very useful, although the on screen text compensates.  This is my third Powershot and the previous ones managed a User Guide booklet.
7.0|#|I bought this as a handy compact camera that would supplement my more expensive, and larger, cameras. As it is, I believe, the only compact camera with an optical viewfinder in current production, this was the only choice I had. Being of a certain age, I find using cameras with only a display screen a great nuisance. Get reading glasses out every time you want to take a picture is hopeless. The Canon is light, simple to use and produces acceptable results.|#|The pictures do not compare with a 400 pound camera obviously and it is not as slim as some other compacts, but overall a good chioce for a point and shoot pocket camera with an optical viewfinder.
9.0|#|Really is a point-and-shoot camera in easy mode.  Macro pics are well-focussed and look really professional. Liked the structure of user manual i.e. the basic easy stuff in a small instruction book, plus the more complicated info. on disc.  That way you don't have to search through reams of text for the answer to a simple query.|#|The batteries don't last long at all if you take lots of shots.  ALWAYS have some spares with you ...
10.0|#|Lots of good features and found it easy to use. Images like all Canons are top notch.|#|I don't think this camera has any bad points.
10.0|#|Excellent quality pictures from uch a cheap camera. Has a usable view finder when needed. Very easy to use menu system. Uses standard AA or AA rechargeable batteries. Video quality is outstanding.|#|Optical zoom not available once you are in video mode.
10.0|#|Nice compact camera with the advantage of having a view finder for looking through as well as the screen. this is very convenient when the sun is shining brightly and makes it very difficult to actually see anything on the screen.|#|None found as yet.

10.0|#|4) Great price|#|Non really....
9.0|#|Having used a compact with only a screen which was useless in bright light, I looked for one with a viewfinder. This one does not dissapoint. Although quite small, the viewfinder is all that's necessary, so much so that I only use it instead of the screen.   The main purpose of having a canera is to take pictures and this one takes good ones. The sharpness and colour are as good as I have seen. The quality of movies puts some camcorders to shame. The movie capacity depends on the memory card. There are more features on the camera than I am likely to use, but the layout makes selection easy. The main control wheel is positioned so you are unlikely to move it accidentally while in your pocket (or handbag) The A1200 ticks most of the boxes for a compact. For me, the decider was the viewfinder.|#|The instruction booklet is just a 'getting started' guide. The main instructions are on the disc. If like me you are not too hot on computers, you will struggle to find what you want. Then when you are out taking pictures, you will think 'what did it say'?
9.0|#|very useful view finder, my elderly mother finds it alot easier to use as had trouble with traditional digital cameras.|#|view finder quite small takes time to get used to
10.0|#|The view finder is invaluable in very bright conditions and I like the use of AA batteries (which you can pick up almost anywhere in the world). Good quality photos and very easy to use. Excellent camera.|#|Card and battery compartment a little 'fiddly' to open (especially if trying to change them in a hurry).
10.0|#|Viewfinder invaluable for bright sunny conditions, (doesn't happen often in UK), but great for foreign holidays when I take 90% of my photos anyway.  Have been a fan of Canon for years and have several Powershot SLR's (still all in working order). Love the date displays and versatility of A1200.  EXCELLENT.|#|Can't think of any off-hand.
5.0|#|Viewfinder, nice design, simple layout, solid buttons and switches, takes AA batteries, brand name reputation.|#|but nevertheless is something to watch out for. As such my review can only be based on my experience of two identical models - if picture quality was as expected I would have given the camera a high rating.
9.0|#|Fantastic point and shoot Camera with excellent results|#|None,  Canon got this one spot on
9.0|#|Viewfinder incorporated. Uses AA batteries.|#|User manual in CD format. Would prefer booklet included.
8.0|#|The camera is quite rugged, simple to use and the great thing is it runs on ordinary AA batteries.|#|Like all the point and shoot digital cameras I've used it is a bit too slow. Taking shots of anything that's moving is a bit hit and miss due to the shutter delay. Guess that's one of the reasons people buy expensive cameras though.
9.0|#|Very easy to use in auto mode and has user modes when more creativity and control is desired.|#|Use of standard AA batteries is disappointing since they deplete rather quickly. We are now using rechargeable AA's.
8.0|#|Compact and easy to handle.  Viewfinder as well as screen is useful.|#|Instructions for use a little confusing.
10.0|#|As a retired person the most important feature is the eye viewfinder.This is a very important feature for my peer group and since my acquistion a number of my friends have indicated an interest in purchasing this model solely because of htis feature.|#|

9.0|#|Very pleased with the product|#|None so far
9.0|#|A nice easy to use pocket camera with a viewfinder, so the screen can be switched off to save the batteries (I use re-chargeables).  Can usually get good results with Program mode.  Not as well made as some, but doesn't feel as though it will break with normal use.  Battery life is quite good and it uses standard AA batteries.|#|Plastic tripod socket.  Some of the effects such as 'Toy Camera' are not very useful.  No case with it but it fits in your shirt pocket so you don't need one.
9.0|#|Lightweight, has a viewfinder for difficult light conditions, has good wide angle - better than older models|#|None at this price and size.
9.0|#|An excellent starter option, and a good cheap camera small enough to carry around at all times for pictures of opportunity ( the pictures are good enough, losing or wrecking it are only a small disaster).|#|small range of settings, unless you know how to program it.
8.0|#|The optical viewfinder is indspensable forshooting in bright sunshine, despite a good screen image.  The use of readily available AA batteries avoids the dependance on a power supply when traveling in remote areas.  Both features, which I consider essential, are not offered by many manufacturers.|#|None spring readily to mind!
8.0|#|The camera is very easy to use, with quite a few interesting features (although I prefer to use the auto-setting). The viewfinder is also useful and I chose this camera partly because it's one of the few to use AA batteries.|#|It's a bit bulky but that's the price to be paid for using AA batteries. There's probably some technogical reason for it, but if this camera could operate on AAA battries, it would be better.
9.0|#|the canon a1200 has an optical viewfinder which is very rare on a compact camera so is excellent in strong sunlight|#|it uses AA batteries which tend to make it comparatively heavy
9.0|#|This camera has a viewfinder, which most point-and-shoot digital cameras lack. It makes a world of difference to what can be done in bright sunlight, when the screen is virtually useless.|#|None of any consequence. This is a very good camera in its price range, and I would recommend it without hesitation.
10.0|#|Rotary dial for selection of mode, unlike the IXUS 75 where the slide switch could be moved when inserting or reving from the carry case. Theviewinder is a good feature, especially in that the optical zoom view is provided.|#|The viewfinder is rather small and can be difficult to locate when you are in a rush to take the picture. Also the field of view through the viewfinder is less than what is actually taken on the photo. This can be  annoyoing at times as a better picture would have resulted from the greater accuracy of the viewfinder, although obviuosly extraneous material can be edited out later.
10.0|#|Light and very compact so easy to slip into a pocket or handbag. Takes very good pictures and downloads quickly.|#|
8.0|#|It has a view finder, which is a boon to anyone having to wear glasses, who wants to take a quick snap.|#|AA batteries make it a bit more cumbersome than it need be

9.0|#|It has a viewfinder which is invaluble in bright sunny weather. Fits easily in ones pocket. Needed something handy to just point and shoot without having to take a camera bag with me everytime.|#|Have not found any so far
8.0|#|Very easy to use.|#|The reason I bought this is because I wanted a compact camera with an optical viewer. This is the only compact that has this feature I believe. It is useless and just shows that same image whether you are zooming or not. It also doesn't show any information - in fact it seems to be just a superficial extra that didn't actually DO anything. This is the only part of the camera that was a dissapointment.
10.0|#|Cracking little camera that has exactly what I wanted.  It has a simple setting which guides you through how to use it as you learn all about the new toy.  Not too costly, lovely picture quality.  I read that it had a cheap plastic bulky body - completely disagree, yes it's plastic but it's a good buy.  Completely understand why it was a which top product.|#|

9.0|#|Great features and flexibility; very good image quality for the price; has a viewfinder too (regard this as vital in some lighting conditions).|#|Quite heavy on batteries; using alkaline AAs now since didn't find NiMH batteries lasting without camera complaining. Like many other cameras now, no doubt the plastic catch on the battery compartment will be a weak point ...
7.0|#|No 1 priority for me - has a viewfinder.  Small, fits in a pocket/handbag.  Takes good pictures in ideal conditions - light and preferably outdoors.  AA batteries so easy to carry spares and don't need power source to recharge.  nice little camera for 'snaps' but a bit disappointing for anything more complex.  Next camera with viewfinder is much more expensive and complicated.|#|Low light setting did not compensate for low light conditions. Not much difference between different settings and auto. Pictures not as good as my very old 3m pixel camera.
9.0|#|Nice compact camera wih good features. Very good image quality. Helpful to have the viewfinder but quite small. Good fun playing around with the different settings i.e monochrome, fish eye lens etc. Haven't used the video yet so can't comment on that aspect.|#|Does feel quite plastic-ey and the battery compartment is quite difficult to close sometimes - quite easy to turn it on whilst doing this! It does feel like it (the battery door) could break very easily, wish this part was more substantial.
9.0|#|Close to the 'ideal' digital point-and-shoot for most users. I use the camera as a back-up to my Canon 450D.|#|None really. Lens could have a few lines of resolution more, but adequat for the price.
10.0|#|Easy to use|#|
8.0|#|Viewfinder - the reason I bought this camera as I find it impossible to use screen in bright conditions.|#|especially removing cover to access battery and memory card.
8.0|#|for me in sunny or very bright conditions); AA Batteries (readily available almost everywhere); the various modes make it suitable for most occasions/requirements.|#|I found the focus frame(s) a bit confusing; the viewfinder is somewhat tiny.

9.0|#|Optical viewfinder! Very rare on a camera of this price, but it means you can take pics in sunlight when others are struggling and squinting at screens! Well done Canon. Perfect and pocketable. Love it.|#|Not a lot! It's cheap and cheerful and you get a fine little camera for your money.
8.0|#|Not too expensive, compact and light. Moulded slightly so it can be held securely when taking shots.|#|Would be better if the shutter button was on the outside of the mode button.

10.0|#|Great camera, does exactly what it shouldm have tried others but always go back to cannon. Even my husband who is more pro user than me is impressed with this camera. You can't go wrong.|#|Would have been nice to have had a case with it, but this is a minor problem as they are easier enough and cheaper enough to purchase.
9.0|#|Very good macro facility, excellent quality sharp close ups of insects etc.  Lightweight, small, packed with features. Autofocus is quick and accurate. Amazing value|#|Runs on 2AA batteries which can run down quickly, particulary if using flash - would recommend 2 sets of rechargables and keep a spare set with the camera
9.0|#|. Though not my main camera it means I can always have a camera with me. Quality is good enough for most purposes as long as I don't want very large prints.|#|Care must be taken in poor light as focussing can be slow in these conditions.
9.0|#|Great camera, really easy to use.|#|
9.0|#|The eye level viewfinder.|#|As far as I can see, the video is only usable in landscape.

9.0|#|Picture quality is excellent. Ovferall a very good camera at a bargain price.|#|Suffers from excessive shutter delay.
9.0|#|I bought it for my 11 year old, but wished I'd had one on a recent trip as lugging the DSLR around was a pain at times! And where I would have need a £300 telephoto lens on the DSLR this camera was able to zoom in and focus sharply.|#|Like most cameras in its class that take AA batteries it hasn't been designed to run on rechargeable ones. That doesn't mean it won't run on rechargeables, but it does show a low battery indicator from an early (if not initial) stage and when it finally refuses to work with the batteries you'll find that their charge is only part spent, so unless you have a smart charger that discharges them before charging them you'll be shorting their life. (I'm talking about NiCad and NiMH batteries; Lithium's may be better.)
9.0|#|This is a canon an d like all canons it has a glass lens which gives sharp pictures. It is very compact and pocketable. Very easy to use. I would describe this as an excellent beginners camera. It has an opticle viewfinder which is usually only available on expensive SLR/Bridge cameras.|#|The functionality is basic compared to more up to date cameras.
10.0|#|Has optical viewfinder (useful for someone like me who needs glasses to see a camera screen). Takes pictures nearly as good as my digital SLR camera.  Extremely cheap for a top quality camera. Without it's case, it easily fits my pockets.|#|Battery life is low but I have bought some rechargeable 2500mAh batteries and the problem appears solved.
10.0|#|Stagering image quality for the money - I have some great A4 prints already.....|#|Haven't found any yet!
9.0|#|I wanted something small and portable with good resolution - mainly to photograph meeting notes from wallcharts/whiteboards, as smartphone cameras just don't give the clarity. I got some nice close up shots of the bird that tried to steal my crisps in the New Forest|#|Personally, I would have preferred a better hard copy manual rather than the disc

9.0|#|Fantastic! Takes great quality photos, is compact and has a lot of good effects. Seems like it should be more expensive, would definitely reccomend!|#|It has a lot of effects, so it takes a bit of time to figure everything out.

9.0|#|It has a viewfinder!!!!  I'd almost given up hope of finding a compact camera with a viewfinder.  I use a Canon SLR for most photography, but like to have a compact in my handbag.

9.0|#|A viewfinder - how many compacts have one? Have just returned from a holiday with a lot of sunshine, The screen was useless, and all 200-odd pictures were taken through the viewfinder. The A1200 is worth the price for that alone. Altogether a nice camera to use, if just a bit slow.|#|The only real criticism is of the viewfinder, but a small one. Being optical, it does not respond when using the zoom!! A bit of imagination helps, though

10.0|#|I bought this camera because it had an optical viewfinder having only just abandoned film cameras.It is well built small and light and I like the ability to recall your picture on the large clear screen and cancel all the dud shots.The pictures are good and crisp too.The price, considering all the facilities is more than reasonable.|#|I have to say that this is the second 1200 ,the first returned under guarantee because the electronic display went haywire.This did not put me off however.I would have liked a more compact battery system but then perhaps their bulk gives a more solid feel to the instrument.Very little to dislike and a lot to like.

10.0|#|Great photos taken, brilliant quality and good value for money|#|Could have more functions like black and white or maybe you can blur the back or the front of the image
8.0|#|I bought this camera for my wife who can't stand trying to see what her camera was looking at when the sun shines! The viewfinder although small is perfectly adequate for holiday snaps and the picture quality seems fine to me. I had read some reviews which said the quality was not good but it's better than my more expensive Olympus.|#|Not too happy about 'AA' batteries but at least the're cheap and easy to get.
10.0|#|A great pocket-sized back up for (or alternative to) to your SLR.|#|No guide marks in the viewfinder to help correct alignment in close-ups.

8.0|#|bought for elderly relative wanting basic camera with viewfinder, so this was just about the only one that fitted that requirement.  Also, using AA batteries makes it easy for her to buy new ones without having to worry about buying the right ones.  More features than needed so the basic 'set and forget' setting is an excellent idea.|#|On/off and shutter buttons not best placed and the openings for battery/card fiddly for less than perfectly agile fingers.

7.0|#|Bought for taking pictures largely in difficult coastal conditions, the camera is simple to use.  The video is surprisingly good.|#|The camera was bought to replace a brilliant Canon Powershot (with viewfinder) that was stolen.  The viewfinder is its bad point. I regard a viewfinder as essential for the many occassions when the screen cannot be properly seen.  The eyepiece for the viewfinder is too small and it is hard to frame a shot.  It is a pity that Canon has effectively dropped the viewfinder as an essential part of compact cameras.

9.0|#|The use of standard AA batteries is brill. I feel relieved from the tyrrany of a specific battery needing a specific charger. This will be an ideal camera for electricity free camping holidays.|#|It doesn't have some of the snazzy colour options - but I don't need them.

9.0|#|Optical viewfinder - AA batteries - single hand operation is easy|#|
10.0|#|nice and compact, easy to use, but also has extra features if you are more knowledgeable. The macro feature is excellent. I used to have a canon A1,many years ago and am looking forward to playing with this more...|#|the zoom is probably the week point, but it is still ok .
7.0|#|Fast start up. Good autofocus. Bright images. Neat styling.|#|Feels flimsy compared to their a480. Battery cover looks like it won't last long.
7.0|#|View finder to help see what you are framing when it is a bright day|#|None found yet- still learning how to use it all
8.0|#|Compact, light-weight and takes great pictures in low light. Impressive zoom and no annoying pop-up flash. Cool colour and smart metal body. Easy to follow menus and clear screen.|#|Battery life could be better and battery quite fiddly to replace. Will definitely need to buy/carry a spare. Cover for USB and mini HDMI sockets feels flimsy. Pricey.
8.0|#||#|No hard copy manual.
9.0|#|I bought this as a camera to take travelling and provide me with first class photos without having endless features that I don't know how to use. The IXUS 230 is excellent in all respects. Small, light and compact, and cuts to the chase by removing a lot of the manual features that the majority of us don't know how to use, without sacrificing picture quality. Would definitely recommend.|#|Cant really think of any.
9.0|#|Easy to take quality photos. Looks good. Feels robust|#|Battery cover a bit flimsy. Menus not as intuitive as others I've used before
9.0|#|Perfect pictures, great colours, great manual options|#|Nil
9.0|#|Superb image quality for a (relatively) cheap compact.  Low light performance is excellent.  Plenty of scene modes and the ability to make some limited manual adjustments if you want to.  Slow motion video is absolutely amazing and the main reason I chose this camera|#|Menu system takes a little getting used to.
9.0|#|The camera is nice, sleek and stylish. I got it in the colour blue and it looks amazing. It takes good quality pictures and its got great camera modes. This is my first personal camera and its pretty decent.|#|You need to a memory card to start taking pictures apart from that I couldn't find any faults with it
10.0|#|Overall a very easy to use camera. We have a digital SLR and wanted a small camera to slip into a pocket. This camera meets our needs exactly.|#|
9.0|#|Really high quality images in low light conditions. Large viewing screen and accurate face recognition. HD video is also really nice too!|#|Auto focus can be a bit inaccurate but only while your getting use to the camera. Also the shutter button and surround is plastic; asthetically metal would have looked and felt better but thats me being picky!
9.0|#|Auto scene selector and facial recognition.|#|Haven't found any yet!
10.0|#|Excellent camera and made a great present for the wife.  She wanted a camare that would take good photos in low light and this works well.|#|Feels a bit 'cheap' with plastic components.  Cheaper Nikon that this was replacing felt better in the hand but did not take pictures of the same quality.
9.0|#|Only had it for a month but what I have seen so far: The many features and functions are surprisingly simple to use. It produces excellent image quality, indoor even 'very good' without flash. The metal casing gives it a robust feeling.|#|As I only had it for a month, I may not have noticed everything but one thing I noticed is that it doesn't give me as good a grip in my hand compared to my previous Canon Powershot A710 IS (that side of the camera is fairly smooth but not 'slippery' though...)
9.0|#|Bought to replace ageing Pentax which which didn't always focus in low light situations, but you couldn't always tell on the tiny screen. This camera focuses sharply every time no matter what the light levels are and the size of the screen gives a very good indication of the photo quality.|#|Sound recording level from video is not all that good, but it was not bought for video use.
9.0|#|just a fabulous point and shoot camera. Absolutely love it and have had some stunning photos of a range of subjects since buying it less than a month ago. Amazing|#|I find the menu really confusing and hard to work out. Hubby hasn't had any problems though, so I think I just need to get used to it.
9.0|#|Small, good image quality, fast, great zoom for such a small camera, great price.  As this model is now not the newest, you don't pay for the unnecessary gimmicks such as 16MP and wi-fi that newer ones have, but you still get a great camera.  A significant step up from all phone cameras.|#|For the serious photographer this doesn't measure up to an SLR or bridge camera, but for its size and price you'll struggle to beat it.
10.0|#|Fabulous camera, very easy to use and small enough for your pocket.|#|
10.0|#|Compact, easy to use|#|None
8.0|#|good image quality in low light conditions eg gigs|#|
8.0|#|Small, neat and great images|#|expensive for what you get
9.0|#|This is a great little camera. Compact, light-weight and very handy for popping in your bag or pocket. I upgraded from the IXUS 120 recently, which I took with me anytime I went anywhere interesting. It's perfect as a 'point and shoot' camera, although the 230 HS has plenty of other features. The movie facility is handy for capturing street scenes, events, people etc. Highly recommended.|#|This model is slighly bigger and heavier than my old one, but this is mainly to compensate for the bigger screen.
10.0|#|There have been criticisms of its controls, but they follow the previous Canon style and I don't have any problem with them.|#|It is too early to judge, but I do just wonder if it is really robust enough.
8.0|#|Qual of image massive improvement on what I had before.|#|Takes a long time to find and get used to and use the features.
9.0|#|Solidly built, good image quality, clear large screen|#|Manual / auto switch fiddly to use

10.0|#|A very easy to use small compact camera which is ideal for everyday use. Good images on both prints and video|#|
8.0|#|The picture quality is really good, even compared with a previous canon ixus.  I haven't looked at all the features available as just wanted to take some snaps and it did the job brilliantly.  Very happy with my purchase.|#|
7.0|#|easy to use pretty much intuitive controls.|#|in auto mode outside on a dull day i had to keep putting the flash on manually or photos were almost totally black even with the flash on the photos were not good
10.0|#|Perfect for casual photography, although I have used on some Olympic sporting events and it coped well.|#|Hard to discover/use some of the functions on the manual settings
8.0|#|Reasonable price|#|
10.0|#|Excellent value easy to use.|#|None
9.0|#|The camera itself is also very aesthetically pleasing to look at, and for who want it, the camera is available in a range of colours.|#|Would prefer to charge the battery within the camera rather than having to remove it but gin this is probably just becausey old camera worked in this way. I'll get used to it.
7.0|#|Not had a chance to do very much with it yet - still getting to know my way round the functions.|#|No user manual included.  It takes so much paper and ink to download it all and is bulky to store.  The old little manuals that used to come included with the camera were so useful and so much better.
10.0|#|Bought for a parent who didn't want anything too complicated, no complaints|#|If you are wanting a camera with a lot of manual controls then this is not the camera for you
10.0|#|Easy and portable camera, well worth the money. You can even mute it so you don't get all the annoying sounds!|#|None as yet!

9.0|#|Great Image quality, fast power on time so ready to take photos very quickly, slow motion video for fun shots of bomb diving a pool! good zoom at x8 but with digital zoom too you can get really close to the action without too much depreciation in quality.  Very neat and smart camera.|#|Because of the amount of features available the menu system, which is well thought out, can be quite extensive, if you want it to be - but you can just leave in AUTO mode for easy use. The buttons could be a little more pronounced to make this the perfect little point and shoot camera.
8.0|#|Stylish design, a wealth of functionalities and, most important, quickly ready to take a picture.|#|Compared to my 5 year old IXUS, I don't think the image quality has improved that much. It is good, no question, but I expected more to be honest.

9.0|#|Compact, lightweight though sturdy quality build, very clear image, reasonably easy to work out the general features .|#|Would have much preferred it to have a small hard copy of the Users Manual rather than having to download a number of A4 size pages which are not so easy to carry around.
9.0|#|Being used by multiple people, needed something easy to use but with good quality .|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use, good compact size that easily fits into the pocket.  Good screen size.  Very good for point and shoot photos if that is the requirement.  Quick to set up and start using.  Battery lasts well.|#|Limited instructions in pack but more available on- line.
9.0|#|So good for such a small camera!|#|None

10.0|#|Small and compact. Easy to use as I previously owned a Canon IXUS and many of the features are easy to use, and in some respects they are even easier on the IXUS 230 HS Compact Digital Camera. I tend to use mine for close up, normal and zoomed in images. Good viewing display and larger than on my previous camera.|#|Shutter noise seems louder than on my previous IXUS and the shutter itself is more delicate  (This probably has some relevance to the shutter speed) and is easily moved if touched with finger when the shutter is closed, although quickly moves back to its resting position. I would recommend that the camera is always carried in a camera case as I would not trust the shutter to remain intact if put in a bag without protection.

The buttons are small and fidley.The sound volume when replaying a video clip on the camera is very poor and nowhere near my old IXUS960is.

If the camera is not a complete package it should be stressed in the product description so buyers are not caught out,

10.0|#|Picture quality is excellent in my opinion.  There are so many features available I am still working my way through them all, so far so good. The G.P.S does work, it located the pictures to within a couple of metres of location although the tracking doesn't seem to follow the actual route taken when displayed on PC.   Maybe I just don't fully understand it yet!   The camera feels solid and well built.  The price I paid was great value, I don't think I would have paid full price.  For me the camera does all I want.|#|Only problem I am having is keeping my fingers out of the way of the pop up flash.  Just got to learn to re-adjust my hold on the camera!
9.0|#|A compact camera which does everything I want it to. It has a brilliant zoom - although a little 'fuzzy' at full zoom. The camera looks good and I found it very easy to get started. I took children having fun and it coped with the movement well. I haven't yet tried the video and there are a lot of other features which I haven't had chance to look at yet!|#|Quite heavy for a small camera. My finger is always where the flash 'pops' up and so registers an error. Will have to re-educate myself to hold the camera in a different place!

10.0|#|Small,portable and with many features found on much more expensive cameras. Good value.|#|Some features hard to find if you are not very intuitive. Paper manual a great help.
10.0|#|'macro'. Still getting to grips with other features. Pictures so far have been great, even at night.  Huge improvement on previous camera (pentax). Would highly recommend particularly for a casual user like me.|#|Not really a bad point, but if taking a large amount of photos in one day, it would be useful to have a second fully-charged battery.

9.0|#|looks good and sturdy. Easy to use and takes very good pictures|#|difficult to keep my finger from covering the 'pop-up' flash. This prevents the flash from rising to its full height. This does not stop the flash from working.
2.0|#||#|I found the battery is sometimes hard to remove and the cover over the usb points a bit fiddly.
9.0|#|Takes good quality photos for the type of camera it is. It has an excellent zoom.|#|The flash is in an inconvenient place. It pops up where my finger is to hold the camera. I just have to remember to hold it a different way when I need the flash.
8.0|#|Clear pictures, GPS is good.|#|Zoom good but you have to hold the camera very still, tricky to do.
9.0|#|Excellent still image quality. Movie quality also very good. Anti-shake works well on long zoom. Well built and simple layout of controls. With a good class 10 card, the shot to shot time is reasonably quick. Battery life good. Small enough to carry anywhere, but still big enough to provide decent handling. This is my third Canon in this series.|#|Like almost all cameras of this type, there is no viewfinder - whatever the manufacturers claim, this is a serious problem with strong sunlight behind you. A Delkin shade helps. the option of Raw would have been welcome.

8.0|#|Easy to use and seems quite sturdy. The price was the main selling point for me. Seems a good quality camera for the money but I have not used it much yet. Time will tell.|#|A lot of people have been complaining about the flash popping up where you finger sits naturally when taking a picture, newsflash, move your finger and it wont get in the way!!! The only point I will bring up is the picture quality at maximum zoom isn't as clear as I was expecting, I think a tripod might sort this problem out though.
9.0|#|I wanted a bit more than a point and shoot, and also small enough to put in my bag, but big enough I could actually hold it and press the buttons.  So after looking at several cameras we came up with this model.  So far I am very pleased with it, and the Picture quality seems very good.  There are also enough programmes to make it interesting to experiment with but not so complicated to put you off.|#|None so far.

10.0|#|I have had two G9s so the G15 is an updated version of what I am used to.  It has a faster lens, which is great, and is excellent for video.  I am pleased the makers still use mainly metal in its construction, so it is more rugged than its rivals.  Also pleased to see Canon returning to a fixed screen, rather than the swivel screen that has limited use and made the camera bulkier.|#|A disadvantage of the fast lens is that it is reluctant to use flash when I want it to, but I will just have to play with the settings.  The box included a CD with a manual, but only in Chinese!  However it is easy enough to find the pdf on the internet.

9.0|#|Small enough to pop in a pocket and take anywhere with good quality build and plenty of features.|#|Pushing it into a tight pocket can accidentally rotate some of the dials on top, so when you pull it out to take a quick shot expecting it to be on  'auto' it may be on portrait, and the exposure compensation on +2 for example.  Not a major issue, but check before you shoot.

I am a commercial photographer and use to use my iphone as my main casual camera but wanted a camera that had images big enough to edit and use without the light being blown out.

9.0|#|Very easy to use, the battery charged very quickly and the camera was ready to shoot within 2 hours and obtained very good results on full auto first time out. Very impressed with lens quality and ease of use. There are many features and it will take sometime to discover its full capabilities. A big plus and the reason for my choice is the HD video and the ability to view through the view finder and also on the screen. Very pleased with my choice.|#|but I suppose some economies needed to be made to keep price down. The instruction manual is printed in very small type face and is not the easiest manual I have ever read, however there are pleanty of online tutorials.

10.0|#|I was looking for a DSLR camera for a very long time and after reading all the reviews I decided to buy the Canon EOS1100D, I have taken atleast 3000 Pictures in the last 1 month but I havent explored the Manual focus yet , I am still using the Auto focus which makes life a lot easier so I am not really bothered about the Manual Focus and cant comment on it.When you zoom a nearby object and take a picture in Auto Focus mode in normal day light , the picture quality is simply Mind Blowing...I would definitely recommend this camera over Nikon D3100 ( exactly the same spec as Canon Eos1100D ) as there is an option to atleast use another lens , just in case.Nikon wont take any other Lens...|#|Night shots are good , wont say excellent.
10.0|#|initial lense 18-55m. I've only had the camera for 1 month, so am still finding me feet with it. However, I'm glad I made the purchase.|#|Camera is bulky, however, I knew this when I purchased it! I also felt a little intimidated with all it's buttons etc, however, I brought myself a Dummies Guide to EOS 1100d. Lastly, again this is no fault to the camera directly, however, be warned once you buy a product of this kind you do end up buying 'extras' battery, sd card, which all adds up!

9.0|#|This was my first SLR, and in all honesty, I expected to have to learn the manual before using.

I recommend it to all!|#|Haven't found any

9.0|#||#|My canon 300 400 all use CF memory cards for which I own a number of high quality rather expensive CF memory cards.  Now I have to start over again to purchase high quality SDHC/SD memory cards.  The quality of the basic kit lens (18-55mm) is well below the expected quality of a canon lens.  The slower frame rate to achieve HD video.  Lack of an external mike output.

10.0|#|I have never owned a DSLR before but found it easy to pick up the camera and get going without any reading up. Learning by fiddling about with settings is fairly easy. More advanced things require reference to the manual, which is small enough to keep handy. The photos look brilliant, and comparisons with other camera-owners seem to suggest that the 500D has more features for the price than anything else. The light weight of the camera is a bonus when carrying it around all day or shooting single-handed.|#|Some features are not adequately explained on screen (and don't have an obvious effect) so reference must be made to the manual.
10.0|#|great images ~ really sharp with excellent colour reproduction . The camera copes extremely well with wierd lighting too ~ like a shot I took of a lit candelabra.

10.0|#|I upgraded from a Canon EOS 400D (which I loved) as I have become a lot more proficient with my photography skills. I got to the stage where there were limitations with what my 400D could do for me. I was torn between going for the 500D or this 50D. I wasn't bothered about the videoing capabilities of the 500D so opted for the 50D. I like the sturdy feel and can look forward to getting to grips with the many different features available.|#|As I expected it is heavier and have therefore had to invest in a new sturdier bag to carry it and my equipment over a period of time. I expected this though and do not see it being a problem.

9.0|#|I have just upgraded from a 450d and I can say this 50d is real quality at a bargin price. It just feels right, for shooting horses showjumping it is great with just over 6 fps I never miss a good picture, the 450d just couldn't quite keep up. battery life is great, just shot about 900-1000 frames on first charge (admittedly no flash used). I shot some photos at a wedding yesterday and they've come out great, even with low light in the church, images have come out sharp and clear. All in all its a great camera and I would even recommend it over a 7d if all you need is a still camera, I still don't understand why people want to use a Dslr to shoot video, but then again I'm probably short sighted. I recommend getting some quality glass to go with this beauty, I bought a canon 24-105 L and its ace. By far the best two purchases I have made towards better photography.|#|Had to buy compact flash cards as my 450d used SD's, no big problem though

10.0|#|Haven't had it for too long, but I'm able to take great pics fairly early on with the kowledge that there is still huge amounts of untapped potential once I get the many features sussed. A well built body that,for me, feels comfortable when I handle it.|#|As yet, I haven't a great deal of negativity to share with you all. I thought it might take a while to get to know all the features and therefore not get any good pics but this is not the case.

9.0|#|Excellent low light perfommance.|#|Can be a bit confusing.
9.0|#|I've had the time to test the camera for a couple of months over a few jobs (wedding/portrait/personal) and it has performed without fault. Image quality is great. Untouched RAW files (I havne't shot in jpeg) seem to have a much deeper colour to them. (My previous camera was a 30D.) Low iso is amazing, though not as good as D700. I tested them both together in the same conditions. Focus at central point is good. Could always be better, but this is just like saying I could always do with more money. Have not tested camera in rain etc so can't say how it performed but it does take the careful use I've given it so far. Viewfinder much better. Live view focusing very useful for still life - however don't forget it will murder you batteries!|#|HD video may not be all you thought so check out it's shortcomings in other reviews, as it is NOT a video camera in a SLR body! Focus points outside central focus points are fairly rubbish. Make sure you have the money for more storage space because RAW files are rather large (approx 24mb). But this is inevitable of better images. Could do with more photography features rather than HD video. OR, video features could be more complete. Even after the firmware upgrade.
9.0|#|love the upgrade view screen on back, the detail in your images can be seen very clear when zoomed right in or out great feature. all in all very good camera, as i only have taken about 500 pics I have got some true good images. The full frame images it produces is a real bonus having not had a camera like this before, but I can get used to this very quickly.|#|not many to talk about, one thing it would be is the video button lock up, as it is very close to the menu I seem to press it by mistake more the often as I try to select menu.
10.0|#|This has to be the camera of choice within the Canon range.  Already owning and well practiced on the Mark 1 5D it is very easy to use as there is very little difference between the two in function applications.  The main differences are:- 1) It has an automatic sensor cleaning function.  The lack of this on the Mark 1 was very annoying. 2) The build quality - better dust and water proofing. 3) Fantastic depth of image with 21 megapixels. 4) Very clear image screen.  There must be more, but having been spoilt with the Mark 1, the other advantages over lesser cameras have been lost on me.|#|It is not light to lug around when combined with a good lens.  THat however, is the price you have to pay for the superb quality.
10.0|#|Image quality is the best I have seen. The detail is astounding. High ISO noise performance is great as well. Much better than my 40D. I was extremely happy with my old 40D but the difference in image quality between that and the 5DMk2 is incredible and certainly justifies the extra money.|#|Access to the side ports (PC, HDMI) don't have individual covers. Could do with a mode dial lock.
9.0|#|I've been a Canon user all my photographic life and the familiarity is great. The full frame chip brings all the lenses back in to play and the 21mpx allows me to use this camera proffesionally. The screen on the back is large, clear and crisp and the new menu system is much easier to use. Starting to play with the HD video and that with the 35mm lenses is superb.|#|The nine focusing points are too center weighted. They need to fill more of the area so that less decomposing is needed. I shoot children's fashion, and if I'm shooting with a low aperture then focusing and the decomposing can result in a slight miss of focus. Not being able to lock both aperture and shutter speed is frustrating. Nikon have had this feature for years, and the 1Ds mkiii has it, why not the 5D mkii? The third stop aperture increments for video is clunky and really shows in playback.
10.0|#|It's like having two cameras for the price of one, each of which I would have been more than happy to buy for the price. You get a great full-frame stills camera that uses the full focal length of the lens and has gorgeous bocah. Then you get to transport much of this across to an full hd camera which uses all the lens. This camera is justly praised and its popularity and people-power leads canon to update the firmware to allow for 24p and manual audio.|#|Just wish audio could be monitored during recording as well as visually looking at levels during record (these are buried two layers down within the menus and only available prior to recording! Doh). But that's really it...
9.0|#|Overall a stunning camera with superb image quality and features.|#|None really but the RAW image size may be a problem to many people who do not have fast(ish) PC's with plenty of memory. As can be expected from such a camera, it is not light and therefore can become a burden when carrying for prolonged periods.
9.0|#||#|- Anything less than prime lenses and L series will seriously effect image quality so again get the credit card out.
10.0|#|It is a stunning piece of equipment. Sturdy, well built. Even though it is heavy, it feels comfortable to hold. Image quality is superb, but watch out for the lenses you use. You really notice the difference between an average lens and a great lens on this camera!|#|None
10.0|#|Image quality is excellent, both stills and video|#|The sound recording system is a bit basic, so you need to record sound separately. But it is really a still camera not a video camera!
9.0|#|Very good as I already have the 5D Mk I|#|Unable to use third party batteries.
10.0|#|A full frame DSLR with excellent image quality. Very good value for money when compared against the other Canon option of a 1DSMk2. Easy to upgrade to from a 40D or similar with all controls virtually the same. Battery life so far has been excellent and well in excess of the Canon stated value. Autofocus with moving subjects like aircarft has been very good.|#|None found so far
10.0|#|outstanding. Everything I'd been waiting for|#|just too bad they didn't update the autofocus. Seems to be better than the original 5D, but still not perfect.
10.0|#||#|NOt as robust as the more expensive ID and 1 Ds I have but for everyday use that is OK. The lightweight makes up  for the disadvantage in most cases

10.0|#|Great pro spec camera with lots of mega pixels. It does the job very well.|#|Big and quite heavy. Accessories for it are very expensive by comparison to lesser Canon DSLR models.
9.0|#|There is a optical correction for your eye's dioptric, which is an excellent feature.|#|It is difficult to understand why canon has saved it when they have the design and they have the production technology. Just not a too wise saving.
9.0|#|Fantastic DOF, image quality and ISO Performance.|#|Autofocus points not amazing in low light, but i knew this when buying it and the good points far out weigh this.
10.0|#|Best digital camera canon have made no bad points.|#|None
9.0|#|Great picture quality - the ability to control and manipulate what you want to. Love the sensor cleaning feature.|#|Slightly complicated menu structure
10.0|#|Great image quality, good noise levels, if you upgrade from a 40d you will be familiar with most of the menu settings, very easy to use considering the quality of images it produces, but you do need top quality optics to do the camera justice.|#|Had the camera 4 weeks and havn`t found anything yet, although AWB in artificial light isn`t great, but this is easily resolved. Would have liked to be able to use batteries from other models.
10.0|#|Lack of noise even at very high ISO. Auto ISO is great for weddings coming from inside a church to bright sunlight. The very clear and concise menu.|#|It wont use my EF-S 60mm
10.0|#|Summarizing: I'm very happy to be the owner!|#|the shutter is a bit lauder than in my old Canon, but if you don't hunt for wild life it doesn't matter really
10.0|#|Absolutely a beauty! I was tempted in going for the 7D for some extra features but finally i decided to go full Frame! Perfect!|#|Its a bit pricy for being quite an old item though...
10.0|#|farily simple to get to grips with the features of this camera and if you have owned a Canon 30D it is so simler to gether that you soon get to grips with all the features and enhancements. Value for money you can't beat the Canon camera range.|#|none that i can think of

9.0|#|High ISO speeds, New Battery Maintenance System, new Batteries, faster shooting, HD recording, improved resolution, improved interface, sensor cleaning, large LCD screen, live view.|#|New Batteries very expensive, still 9 point AF, battery door is poor build, no fire wire just USB.
9.0|#|A truly awesome piece of kit for still images resolution. This 21 megapixel beast will knock spots off 10 megapixel resolutions when blown up to A3 and larger. Good solid build quality and feel. Worth every penny although the HD movie mode has some way to go on the sound recording - picking up all extraneous noise. Nice clear viewfinder from this full frame model is reminisscent of the early 35mm film cameras. Built in flash would be handy but with ISO of 6400 extendable, low light possibilities are good. Nice clear screen for playback and live-view.|#|Fiddly power on switch. If you want excellent image resolution especially for landscape this is the one, but 3.9 frames per second may be a bit slow for action/sports wildlife photographers compared with other faster models. The 21 megapixel sensor will eat up your camera and pc/laptop memory - you will need 16Gb CompactFlash to get just under 600 images in RAW. You will need to purchase a external microphone kit to get best use of the HD Movie mode as built in microphone picks up all ambient noise including changing settings on the camera. No bulit-in flash.
9.0|#|A fantastic full frame sensor still camera, and with the new firmware update it's possibly the most versatile video camera available - achieve depth of field effects simply unavailable for anything at this price.|#|Lacks some of the features of the 7D (60fps shooting, burst rate) but more than made up for by full frame sensor.  Note you will need to spend a lot of money on lenses to make good use of this camera.
10.0|#|Having used various Canon SLR's I am most impressed, I just cannot fault any part of it.|#|None
9.0|#|Excellent full frame image quality, big resolution images that easily print at A3 at 300DPI, a significant leap over my old crop sensor EOS 50d, fantastic quality video footage especially with L series glass,  superb contrast and colour reproduction,|#|Autofocus system not matching the speed and accuracy of the EOS 7D, but very happy with the full frame sensor and overall image quality, If only the shutter speed / Frames Per Second was a little faster it would be the perfect all round camera. EF Lens mount only so all of your old EF-S / crop sensor lenses will need replacing.
9.0|#|Superb image quality, full frame sensor, excellent LCD display, greatly improved menu layout and options compared to 5D Mk 1, video capability, particularly like the 3 custom settings available on the main mode dial|#|Mediocre build quality - OK but as solid feeling as comparable Nikon

9.0|#|Very high pixel count for the money, in an excellent body. When you factor in the video capability, there is little in the way of competition. Batteries last well and can be topped up. Get a good quality glass protector for the viewing screen.|#|Batteries were expensive and were very hard to source at launch. Could have done with more focus points.
10.0|#|Perfect body. I used 40d then 50d and 60d but 5d is much better|#|60d have flash, better screen, movies
10.0|#|Great to use, excellent results especially with the large screen.|#|A very heavy piece of kit when combined with L-Series lens, flash gun and battery grip!
10.0|#|If you are upgrading from a smaller Canon camera you will find the 5D comfortable and easy to use. Plus it is simply superb quality.|#|
9.0|#|Fantastic camera all round. High-end quality at a really cheap price. Photos and video look amazing|#|nothing yet, i really love this camera
8.0|#|Pic quality is excellent, you can take natural pics, high ISO capability means that you don't have to rely on flash (camera does not have an in-built one anyway).|#|You do need to spend some time with the manual, checking vids on youtube etc. to get the best out of this camera. But that time spent will pay huge dividends.
9.0|#||#|no flash  .  the need to buy the english battery charger, instead of the european/american provided
10.0|#|I have used the 5D MKI for many years so was unsure whether to upgrade to the MKII but am extremely pleased that I have.  The image quality is excellent and I am loving shooting at high ISOs.  Having the built in sensor cleaning puts my mind at ease and so far I haven't had any problems with dust spots despite numerous lens changes. I also really rate the screen brightness which I have set on automatic and can now see my shots perfectly even in bright sunlight.|#|I am a bit unsure about the auto colour balance which doesn't seem as good as the 5D MKI in mixed lighting, especially tungsten.

9.0|#|Light, relatively easy to use for a digital newby like me, great pictures, easy to use software.  The only reason I didn't rate it 10 for everything but price is I'm still really learning what it can do.|#|Price!
10.0|#|The 5D Mark II is a different world from the 400D I came from when I upgraded.  Not only does the full frame capture a great range of detail, but the resolution and ISO performance are really amazing.  The build quality is fantastic, the camera is a good size and weight even when using larger lenses like the 70-200 or 100-400.  Battery life is great, you can even track battery performance via individual batteries and their serial numbers (if you use canon stock.)  Overall, this is a knock out camera, highly recommended if you're looking for a reasonably priced full frame body and already have an investment in Canon/EF glass.|#|No easy way I could find when using Bulb mode for long exposures to display the exposure time on the LCD.  This means counting off your exposures when working pre-dawn.  Nothing a watch can't resolve though.
10.0|#|Fantastic camera. The quality of the images are outstanding. Obviously requires L lens. If used to Canon cameras it is easy to use. I bought it for the image quality also the increased ISO SETTINGS.|#|None

10.0|#|Amazing image quality|#|Batteries and lens are expensive
9.0|#|Stupendous image quality and great colour rendition.|#|Very little. A faster continuous shooting speed than 3.9fps would have been useful when photographing birds. Personally I miss the basic zone options on the mode dial but that is more out of habit than anything and you can fairly easily configure your own.

9.0|#|Already a Canon user, this was a short learning curve. Image quality is what I was after and it is superb. Save money, don't by the fastest lens or the longest lens, just use higher ISO (low noise) and pull up the centre of the image if you can't fill the frame. Seemples!|#|Pricey but actually more bang for your buck compared to the 5D when it first came out. I've no complaints. Why not mould on a bigger battery compartment like my 1Dmk111?

Long lasting battery (I have taken 1000 pictures in 2 days without a recharge).|#|Noisy shutter ( 5 pics a second mean things have to move fast ), high ASA/ISO  1600+ pictures can have a pattern that looks like printer banding on them ( mostly in the shadows ). The small image sensor makes it expensive to get a true wide-angle lens
10.0|#|I bought this as an update to the iXus 700 and was not disapointed both with  the build quality and the end results.

As a previous owner I was familiar with the controls, but if I'd have been a first time user I wouldn't have been too happy about having to wade through the disc to find out how to use it!

9.0|#|I bought this camera to my holidays in Greece this year. The features in this camera are amazing. This camera's got different modes such as portrait, fireworks, night, beach, snow... Pictures taken on the beach or landscape were perfect. A good tip is - if you want to take pics from sunset put the camera on night mode - the result is fantastic. Batteries last long, and the video quality are very good, since it's a camera, not a camcorder. As I read the manual, I could make the most of this camera so I think this is the best value for money and I recommend it!!|#|The shut lag is too long when using the flash, but for me this is ok.

10.0|#|The best all round digital camera I have ever owned, including DSLRs.  It is simple to use, has loads of features, gives fantastic quality images even when enlarged, looks and feels like a very high quality item and fits easily into a shirt pocket, even with the massive screen.  Overall it's about the size of a deck of playing cards.  Excellent quality video recording as well.  Also fits into a Canon waterproof / underwater case to use whilst swimming / diving / snorkelling or just to protect it from knocks.|#|No bad points but with anything that is miniaturised like this, you do have to treat it with care so that it doesn't get damaged.  Therefore, it's not really suitable for young children or for using in serious activity sports.
10.0|#|I was bought for quick quality snapping and it does what it says!!! Love the really big screen and the fact that it is so compact that I can easily take it anywhere with me. Feel that it is very competitively priced against similar cameras and designed really well. Like the reasurance of buying a quality make.|#|Can't think of any yet!!! Would certainly recommend it.

9.0|#|It's great that you can remove red eye/change the colours and edit the pictures on the camera itself/ Outdoor pictures and portraits come out really well. It's compact and looks great. The viewing screen is huge, so you can review pictures easily.|#|It takes a bit of getting used to using it bcause there are so many functions. There are lots of functions that I haven't yet used as a result. The flash is quite powerful, so I'm experimenting with getting better colours/exposure on indoor shots.

10.0|#|Easy to use, large screen with big clear instructions visable and easy to read. This camera is lightweight, good to look at and looks more expensive than it actually is, especially compared to the same model in silver/black. It's great value for money and the pictures are up to the standards of Canons higher spec models. In camera red-eye correction is excellent and even works on childrena and animals eyes. whick are usually a problem when using flash.|#|Can't think of any execpt I didn't like the leather strap that came with the camera as I prefer a smaller light strap, but this is only a minor niggle that is easily altered.

10.0|#|This camera is absolutely wonderful.  My daughter had it first and I was so impressed I checked out all the reviews and saw how people raved about it so I bought one myself.  I can find no fault with it whatsoever.  The screen can get a bit greasy but that's not a problem.  It's a great little camera.|#|Everybody likes it and everybody I know wants one - if you could say that's a bad point!!

The new IS range has come out and these prices are already falling.

10.0|#|Ease of use|#|
8.0|#|This is an excellent camera with most of the features you'd find in a DSLR, but at a size that fits in your pocket. Image quality is outstanding and the ability to shoot in RAW format gives you the ability to make more adjustments after shooting than you can with a camera that only shoots JPEG. If you're after a top-end compact camera this is definitely worth looking at.|#|For all its features, it is a little on the pricey side.
8.0|#|The G9 is a very competent camera and produces very good recordings of the image taken. Its slightly larger size and weight from other cameras allows for better control and handling and most of the controls fall easily to hand. 12 megapixels is impressive in its own right but the ability to join pictures in the supplied software allows for monster sized images to be produced.|#|The supplied memory card is woefully small and should be replaced at the soonest opportunity. I personally did not like the suite of software supplied with the camera finding them 'too idiot proof'
9.0|#|Sturdy and feeds comfortable in the hand. Excellent LCD screen. Able to shoot various file sizes including RAW.|#|Don't use 1600 ASA - terrible noise. Lack of remote control. Canon capture software useless! Use Breeze.
8.0|#|Great image quality and excellent features.  The RAW files are great but limited support available in imaging software as yet.  Superb build quality.|#|Short battery life, buy a spare.  Not much else.
10.0|#|Its size, it has a lipo battery, a view finder and add on flash all that I wanted from this product|#|the manual is not very clear - I am very much a beginner
9.0|#|Manual features that empower the photographer. Solid build quality. RAW enablement. Great Macro. Sharp images with good light.|#|Low light capability. High ISO= High noise.
8.0|#|RAW option, extensive manual control, great build quality|#|Resolution maybe too high, quality might've been better if resolution remained at 10mp like the G7. Limited performance for night photography due to small sensor compared to a DSLR
10.0|#|comfortable grip, exellent display, ease of use and downloading.|#|None

10.0|#|handling is superb access to dials and buttons is simple, the quality of build and look makes this camera a prise to own.|#|Would like to see more coverage at wide angle, rather than having to buy adaptors.

10.0|#|I can't fault the camera|#|None
9.0|#|solid build and packed with features.  Raw capture is the biggest bonus though.|#|
8.0|#|Has full manual control for those that want to think about taking photographs. A great compact compromise, you don't need an SLR.  Very good battery life, easy downloading.  Full auto features for snap-happy moments (which I use a lot) but a pleasure to over ride when time, opportunity and subject permit.  Some 'wow!' shots with the macro and I can't believe the stitching results.|#|controls.  For me reading the manual was essential (something less than common) and as a new user I have to wonder a bit where to find the control I'm looking for.  But it's this control which elevates the quality of the experience.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality, easy to get use to if familiar with SLR controls, clear bright 'big' LCD display.|#|Not experienced any yet!  But I am new to digital photography.
8.0|#|This is simply a first class camera for the user looking for a slightly more professional bit of kit than the average point and shoot machine. I've never been a huge fan of the viewing screens on digital cameras (preferring to use the eye viewfinder) but the quality of the one on this model is excellent and its size makes it easy to frame what you're shooting. I'm still getting to grips with all the facilities it offers but so far I'm delighted with the camera.|#|The only minus point so far is the lack of a hard copy of the full user manual. I much prefer to have an instruction book to flick through rather than scrolling around the CD rom manual.
10.0|#|Easy to use, clear large screen, sturdy and good handling. No fuss, no nonsense.|#|style!
8.0|#|Good battery life, quick power on time, good photos in varying conditions.|#|Not much grip to hold camera tightly.
10.0|#|all good|#|just that you can see the nose of the lens in the viewfinder
10.0|#|For a compact digital camera it has to be the best outside bying an expensive SLR. With 12mp whats there to grumble about. Both my wife and myself have found it easy to use with it being user friendly from the off. Need to learn a little more about some features but who doesnt when bying a new camera. We wanted the best of both world. a compact camera with the features and photos of an expensive larger SLR. This ones a winner.|#|Not really a bad point about the camera but more of my experience with cameras. Theres a bit too many features but I'm sure with time I'll learn to use them to get the most out of the camera. Is this a bad point????
10.0|#|This camera has a wonderful macro at only 1cm from the subject. You can shoot in RAW and manual. Very unusual for a compact camera. It's very easy to use and feels substantial in your hands, not at all plasticy. If you use it on manual it gives you a very good rendition of what you were looking at. I bought this camera as I wanted one that I could carry around with me. I have two DSLRs and they're too big for my handbag! :) I slip the strap over my grandson's head, put it on auto and off he goes. I also bought it for the macro. I do wedding photography and I wanted to use the macro on the G9 rather than change lenses on my cameras. I've been REALLY pleases with the results.|#|I haven't found any yet.
9.0|#||#|dont like plastic lens casing
9.0|#|incredible image quality  , a joy to use , and build quality that gives pride of ownership .Even for the occasional photographer , you'll struggle to put it down . I don't think I'll ever tire of it . A little bit quicker and it'd be faultless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!|#|manual only on cd
9.0|#|There are too many good points to mention. Each time i take it out to use i discover something new about the camera.|#|It is a technical camera in a small camera disguise. This is not a bad thing. but with the product being more technical than the smaller compact point and shoot cameras it would be nice for the instruction manual to be pre printed for you.
9.0|#|Build, image quality, range of advanced easy to access features, large LCD, 6 x zoom. Image stabilization. Easy program shift feature by using exposure lock. Great for serious photographers when you don't want to carry a lot of kit.|#|Expensive, LCD gathers fingerprints too easy, wide end only 35mm, poor viewfinder.
9.0|#|am disabled with the loss of my right arm and I find at I can use his camera without having problem's as long as I plan what I am going to shoot, I have taken some good sunset's and also some moveing shots ie horses in full gallop on the beach, I am realy happy with my camera and never leave the house without it, we live very close to the beech andthere is alway's somethig to snap|#|nil
10.0|#|very easy to use and a great image|#|none so far
6.0|#|This is a sturdy camera.It has an excellent array of functions and settings including Raw image files.|#|When shooting in auto mode the colour green looks flourescent and artificial... never seen this before in other cheaper! digital cameras. also if you tilt the camera upwards in a cathedral eg. to take a picture of something on the wall, everything looks really dark and the green box goes hazy! so am a bit dissapointed considering the cost of this camera I would not have expected these problems.

10.0|#|Brilliant compact camera.  I bought it to replace an old Cannon digital camera and I am very pleased with my new one.  The menu system is similar to the old camera so I found it really easy to find my way around.|#|The shutter delay is a little slow in my opinion but looking at other online reviews it is comparible to most cameras of the same price range with similar features.  Disapointingly it is slightly slower than my old camera.
9.0|#|SD card compatible|#|
10.0|#|This camera is the best I have ever had! Image quality is absolutely superb. It is easy to use and feels sturdy. I bought this camera 3 days before going on a big holiday. I learnt how to use it the night before I went and the end results (540 pictures) were fantastic. I took fireworks pictures, low light, glare from the sun etc. and really used the camera to test its ability.|#|There aren't any!
9.0|#|white features|#|Sometimes overexposed pictures in certain lights
9.0|#|Picture quality is excellent, numerous shooting modes help get the best shot, even in a ordinarily lit room at night ist possible to get noise free shots with decent colour.  Panormic mode is easy, with a line electronically displayed on the screeen showing where the join will be!|#|Fiddly connection for USB, menus not as easy to grasp as other makes I have tried eg Olmpus.  Tiny memory card supplied.
9.0|#|Very simple to use, features adequate for my use as a very amateur photographer. Easy access to features. Love my camera look forward to learn as much as I can about all the features.|#|Very disappointed with lense, in hindsight would have just bought the body and then purchaesed a good lense seperately, 70-300 for example. The viewer is rather small should have gone that little extra and bought the 400.
8.0|#|Good first time slr with excellent quality of image.Also a good range of additional accessories which are compatable.|#|none to mention

9.0|#|excellent performance generally, image quality very high, many good features and versatility, as small and light as could reasonably be expected.  Battery life is amazing and spare batteries cheap.|#|Finish a little cheap, quality of plastic poor, with a tendency to scratch easily, also dust on sensor from new!  Controls a little too compact and can be fiddly, especially with large fingers.  Kit lens is not the best and does limit the performance of the camera.  The grip is not as good as it could be, it is a bit small and smooth and makes the camera easy to drop in some situations, especially with a larger lens.  Default settings did not give the best image; it took some time and experience to get the results I expected.
9.0|#|Compact,light and yet with all the features of a much bigger camera|#|Only had it a couple of months, but cant find any yet.
9.0|#|Excellent easy to use quality digital SLR with interchangeable lens capability|#|Rather small body - I prefer the 300D for size but the 350D has improved features - can't win them all I suppose!
9.0|#|Very quick start up.  The most frequently used features eg. ISO setting, metering and white balance have short cut button so that you don't have to scroll through the menu to change them.  Good ergonomics - it fits nicely in the hand.  Simple to use - it can be used straight out of the box.  Battery life is excellent.|#|Haven't found any yet.  It is bulky but that is to be expected with an SLR.
9.0|#|Instant on - no descernible shutter lag. Best spec. for the money at this time.|#|It's got 'Canon' printed on it so all your accessories cost more than they would with a non-Canon/Nikon.
10.0|#|The Canon 350D is a superb camera offering excellent photographs. The clarity is beyond any other camera I have found for the price, it is also very easy to use in full auto mode but can be set up to be used by a more expeienced photograher.|#|None
9.0|#|The image quality is supurb and with the different modes you can experiment and improve your technique and results.|#|For people with large hands it can be a little awkward to hold but with the Battery Grip added it's brilliant.

10.0|#|Brilliant Digital SLR at very good price, makes it very easy for anyone to enter the world of semi profesional photography at a realistic price.|#|Only bad point I have encountered is if you fill the memory card fully, you cannot delete any images, as the camera lcoks up and tells you its full. Transferred images across using a card reader, been fine since I now keep a close eye on the available space.
10.0|#|Excellent value for money, image quality outstanding for a camera of this price bracket.|#|Kit lens covers a useful focal range but is of basic build quality and is non USM drive.  I would imagine most users will want to upgrade to better optics in the medium term, to get the best out of this camera.  Having said that, I managed to take some stunning images with the kit lens!
10.0|#|This Camera is fantastic and the quality is second to none that I have owned or experienced.|#|There are no bad points and I can only say that it never ceases to amaze me just what I can do with it.

Don't get me wrong it's not a Nikon D90 or a Canon EOS 50D, but saying that the functions are well balanced and take's great photo's..  Now I have had one, wouldn't swap it for a D90 or a 50D...  Maybe a Canon 7D or 5D Mark2....  /dream|#|You need decent batteries for this one.  I got some 2500's and they are doing me well..  normal 600's got chewed within a couple of hours..

9.0|#|easy to operate|#|As yet i have not found any bad points
9.0|#|The camera is of the high standard and quality you expect from Canon giving excellent results.  Being a bridge camera it is just what I wanted with SLR facilities but not the need to keep changing lens for different situations.  I would highly recommend this camera to anybody who is looking for more than an ordinary compact but not wanting a full blown SLR.  In short it is solidly built good quality Canon camera with lots of scope for the beginner to advance with.|#|None discovered so far.
9.0|#|HDMI is fantastic.|#|I am a bit concerned about the picture quality but have not had enough time to experiment with the different modes and features, so could be my lack of knowledge in using it properly.

8.0|#|Good build quality and image quality|#|A little expensive for a bridge camera
9.0|#|Feels good and solid, and easy to pick up the basics. Even for a complete novice like me.|#|Minor point, but I would prefer a proper user guide manual, instead of the cd version.
9.0|#|I have not had much time to use it yet but so far it seems extremely good.|#|A complex product if you really want to use it in depth which will require quite a bit of study.  A paper manual would be helpful.

A custom leather case would be a much better option than the cloth fabric case offered.
9.0|#|Small, light and pocket size. Good quality photos can be achieved. It is great as a point and shoot but also has manual settings for more advanced use.|#|The manual is on a CD but it would be better to have a manual in paper form included to check operation points while out and about.

9.0|#|Overall I am extremely pleased with this little gem, and feel it was well worth the effort of researching the market.  And worth the effort of reading the 170 page user guide.  If you want a lot more than a snap-shot camera, download the Ixus 980 IS full specification and get ready for some real enjoyment!|#|flush.  You can switch on using the easier 'playback' button.  This immediately shows your last photo and you can easily scroll back, but pressing the shutter button half way brings the lens out and you can shoot as usual.  But you still have to switch off with the awkward ON/OFF button.  The video function is quite good but... I have not found a way of keeping the focus in operation, so it starts off sharp then loses focus if the subject moves in or out.  If video is important to you, there is another Ixus model (cheaper) which has HD. It might manage auto focus, but I have not checked.  The User Guide is a reduced photocopy effort- not up to the standard of the rest of the product.  But it is readable and fairly thorough.
10.0|#|small good to put in pocket|#|none
10.0|#|There are numerous good points.  The camera is feature packed and spec'd to a level which you'd expect to find in a DSLR.  The pre-programmable print button is great feature for assigning various options (I've assigned mine for one touch manual white balance control- great for vivid underwater shots [although the scene underwater mode is also excellent]).  The battery life is great, build quality superb and image quality fantastic.  Having just returned from a diving trip to Scapa Flow (Orkney's) I now have a SDHC card with over 300 high res images both on land and underwater.  It'll be a struggle to decide which ones to print, as there are many gems!  These cameras are a must for any diver wanting to purchase a camera with manual white balance control, without running to the expense of a DSLR.  The camera is a doddle to operate and the supplied software allows for a good degree of post image editing.....not that you should really need to with this camera in your pocket!  For those wishing for a similar spec but with a large zoom I'd suggest the G10, which has the same number of features but comes with a larger zoom lens.|#|Due to its compact architecture, the flash is a little close to the lens.  Consequently when used with an underwater housing a shadow effect occure owards the lower right hand side of the image.  This can be eliminated with the use of a separate underwater strobe, a worthwile investment for any keen underwater photographer.  The digital zoom isn't worth using unless you have a very steady hand or tripod, as the noise created even in lower res shots can dramatically reduce the quality of the image.  VGA movie recording rather than high definition has its drawbacks (although the camera was launched in October 2008, and technology has moved on.  HD isn't the be-all and end-all in fact I've heard that people need to reduce the number of frames per second in order to playback many HD movies shot on cameras as their frame rate exceeds current DVD playback speeds.)
9.0|#|Handy size that packs in a good file size, easy to slip int your pocket.|#|
9.0|#|The camera is a little chunkier than the Ixus 55 but you hardly notice it due to the overall quality of the product. Definitely well worth buying this camera. I spent ages researching this item and found it to be a lot cheaper on this website.|#|The round switch tends to flick to other settings easily so you have to double check before taking a photo.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality, even in low light conditions. The 'auto' setting is adequate for pretty well any conditions or situations that I have so-far encountered. It's very useful to have a viewfinder, an item that is beginning to disappear from digital cameras. The movie-clip quality is very high, including the sound. In an editing suite it's almost impossible to distinguish between the video from the IXUS and the video from my Sony Handycam. The camera is very small and light and an underwater housing is available for scuba.|#|It's quite difficult to get perfect focus when using the 'macro' setting to photograph very small objects. It seems to work best if you position the red dot from the camera's led beam slightly in front of what you want to photograph. Once you get the autofocus right though the image quality is excellent. It's sometimes difficult to know whether you have successfully switched off the flash, as both 'on' and 'off' symbols are very similar and very small. The combination of zoom and macro seems to throw the autofocus out slightly. It's better to move the camera closer to the subject.
9.0|#|Very neat and compact mid-price camera with a good feel in the hand. Small enough to carry around easily. Gd LCD quality. Still v new so haven't had a chance to explore all the features.|#|

Manual (etc) options make it very flexible for creative shots. Feels well made. Surprisingly good flash coverage. Joy of joys, it has a viewfinder.|#|Pictures display vingetting (dark corners). Delayed reaction when pressing the shutter - even if pre-focussed. PIctures seem to lack sparkle and most are improved by 'auto correction' on a PC. Digital zoom (only) on video gives unacceptable results. The viewfinder is not very clear and does not show the whole of the image. Menu navigation is not intuitive (to me). Lens cover 'leaves' do not close flat every time.
9.0|#|This camera has lots of features, we particularly like the colour accent setting. The picture quality is very good and easy to take good pictures.|#|The dials are a but fidly and the menus take a bit of working out, if you've had a canon before it only takes 10 minutes with the manual and you can see where all the more advanced settings are.

10.0|#|It had so many good points it is difficult to pick out just one or two.   I certainly found many things that I didn't have on my other Digital Camera which gave me a much wider menu to pick from, also the number of Pixels which I can now control and use less if I want to. .|#|I did find it a little difficulty with the Zoom button placement as it tended to take  a little time for me to control it at the Zoom distance I wanted. Perhaps it was just me as I was so used to to my other digital being very  precise and better placed on the back away from the shooting position button.

10.0|#|Excellent product. Although I have larked 'Ease of Use' down, the only reaon for this is that as it has leading features in 'manual' mode that require learning, it would naturally not be as simple to use in this mode as other 'just Auto' camers. That said, in manual mode, it's excellent.|#|Would have been nice to bundle with a case.

9.0|#|The macro was brilliant, very easy to check live focus, it will be great for small criters like the Pigmy sea horses and nudibranch.|#|If using the flask and the underwater housing a shadow is produced by the lens extension 'tube'.. I will need to buy an external strobe.
3.0|#|Build quality|#|For a high end compact camera from Canon it is very disappointing.  Far too slow to focus/take and process the image.  The moment is missed most times. Image is not very sharp considering this is a 15 mp camera.  I don't think it is any better than a cheap Casio or Samsung, certainly much inferior to the Panasonic Lumix which is less expensive.  I will not be keeping this - a waste of money.  I already have a Canon digital SLR and was expecting almost as good quality

Because of the AA batteries it is quite heavy but it does mean you can change the batteries in the middle of the day!|#|The dial is hard to use to move between the scenery settings - it takes some getting used to.
8.0|#|Why carry the extra weight and bulk when this has 95% of an SLR's capabilities.|#|Needs a standard screw thread on the end of the lens to take filters (UV, Polariser, Cokin Filters etc).

10.0|#|I bought this as an update for the SX1IS as I had found this to be a great camera but it has sadly gone wrong. The update to 20X optical zoome is amazing. I find the camera easy to use as separate dials/buttons do different things rather than having to trawl through a menu on a single control. It feels sturdy in the hands and makes photography comparable to my old film SLR but with the bonus that you don;t have to worry about wasting film.|#|Haven't found any as yet

9.0|#|Terrific Camera....The super zoom with image stablisation is great. I like the bigger feel of the camera and this suits me. With a little knowledge, you can achieve almost anything that you want|#|If you are inclined to use auto setting only, you may be disappointed. I find myself using the program mode and + 2/3 exposure as I find auto pictures a bit dark.
9.0|#|Well made and easy to use on auto. Fantastic lens and fantastic anti shake feature. Good stereo sound. Feels good in the hand. My best camera so far.|#|The lens cap is easily lost. The menus are a bit confusing (or is it the manual).
8.0|#|shot modes produce excellent results with little or no effort.  Intelligent face recognition that follows your face, multi AF settings galore, the list goes on and on.  The colours it produces are vibrant and realistic and in low light it does a decent job even at long focal lengths.  If you're brave, you can set this baby into full manual and configure everything to your heart's content.  I think the best mode is 'Program mode'.  You can also attach a standard flash beam or additional lenses/filters. This camera is almost SLR quality but for digital camera money.  Have I mentioned it does wide-screen photos too?|#|This camera is not small, it's much bigger and heavier than my previous camera the SX110 and a lot of that bulk is consumed by the gargantuan lens and zoon function.  It can be held easily in the average hand but you will normaly need 2 hands for taking shots.  You will need a proper camera bag - don't be tempted to try and fit this in a handbag!  The stated batttery life in my experience is nowhere near 340 shots, it nearer to 250 but maybe that was becasue I was playing so much with the features and the zoom.  The viewfinder, although it has manual focus adjustment is not very good against the competition.
9.0|#|Well-designed and easy to handle with good locations for the controls.|#|There are a lot of features on this camera.  It would have been good to have a printed copy of the whole handbook for quick reference when using it, rather than have to use the PDF on a computer.

9.0|#|Takes pictures very quickly and easily, picture quality and zoom outstanding.|#|When looking through picture library the round scroll bar is easy is accidentally move, meaning you suddenly end up looking at a picture you weren't expecting. Flash is a bit too strong at first but this is easily fixed with a bit of fiddling with the settings.
10.0|#|Build quality is excellent, the LCD screen is large and clear plus it is still clearly visible even in the sunlight. The different scene settings give plenty of flexibility.|#|A little heavier than I would have liked but that is most likely due to the robust build quality. It is too easy to catch the selection ring which is positioned around the main button arrangement.
9.0|#|I bought this cam to replace my Sony P72 in preparation for a visit to Florida. The camera is easy to use when set on automatic and it copes well with most situations. Image when fully zoomed was much better than expected. Battery life is excellent and the flash seems upto most tasks. The movie feature is good, allowing editing which was not available on my last cam, would have prefered mpg instead of mov format. The cam is ready for action quickly, much faster than my old Sony. It's also fairly robust (it has been dropped a few times). The face detection mode waits for you to join the photo, by counting the faces then waiting for one more, it actually works !|#|The flash cannot be forced on when in auto (it can be force off), this sometimes leaves some unwanted shadows. Using one of the program modes gets around this. Nightshots can be trouble for the canon, mainly trying for focus.

9.0|#|Image Quality is just great, much better than I expected. Really am impressed. Video is amazing too. Very light weight, I carry mine in shirt pocket it`s so small. Battery life is ok, altho I`d recomend carrying a spare as back up. Start up time for first shot is very quick.|#|On/Off button is poorly designed. Cannot find it by feel alone. Taking photos of animals can be problematic unless you learn how to skip through menu quickly enough for pet shots otherwise a blurred image results.
10.0|#|Simple to use in auto mode, spend time exploring the features and be even more amazed what this little camera can do. I bought it to use at a friends wedding and got some fantastic pics, I used it for about 14 hours taking pictures and recording HD videos on the day and the battery ran out when it was time to leave the wedding party. I viewed the pictures and videos on the telly and was really impressed! All in all, if you want a small camera that does so much and record HD videos with great functions and ease of, I would thoughly recommend this camera.|#|It's difficult to list the bad points because I'm so pleased with the camera. If I was to mention thing it would be the size of the circular control button, it's small, but I do have big hands! You get used to it after a short while, like the buttons on a new and unfamiliar phone.
9.0|#|Nothing was straight). Image quality is fine for a camera of it's size. It's not amazing quality compared to the 90IS or something bigger, but for an ultra compact with this many features I don't think you could get much better.|#|Please note that I list all these points being as critical as I can. I would still buy this camera dispite them all. And still recommend it to anyone after a great quality ultra compact. If you want better quality, then go look at larger things that won't fit in your pocket.
10.0|#|Great little camera. I was almost going to get the Cybershot but this Cannon takes much better quality pictures when printed. It's very little, so perfect for the pocket or handbag. I only use the auto setting, but will aim to investigate the manual settings as I think I could take some great shots manually.|#|
9.0|#|video quality are amazing compared to my last Sony camera.|#|Because of the small size and flush rear buttons its can be difficult to change settings or view pictures unless you have child size fingers.
9.0|#|LOVE the colour accent feature - you can select a colour that stays and the rest goes black and white! also fab macro images. i love this camera!!!!!|#|night shots seem to come up with blobbly aura bits (as though there's dust on the lens... i'm sure it's because i've not got to grips with the settings yet but it does this on auto mode as well...
4.0|#|Light camera at a good price. This is easy to use once you understand the available settings.|#|Having to remove the battery to charge is a real let down. Having used the Canon ixus i7zoom which had a docking station for both charging and transfer of photos, this camera seems a little lacking. The Camera Window software seems to have regressed as it has less features than previous versions.
9.0|#|It's tiny! Can easily fit in the same pocket as my phone. It has intelligent auto so is great as a capture anything point and shoot|#|It's got no wide angle - loads of close up shots you just cant get when out with friends in a group. The lens isn't wide enough so you have to step back which means you miss anything spontaneous

9.0|#|Love it love it, very crisp photos and all the photos come out very good. the design is so sleek and mine (red) is a great colour to have, its easier to see the buttons in the red colour than say, the gold one.|#|sometimes but slow with taking the photo if the camera feels to close or light problems, the camera will take time to automatically adjust (e.g- macro) and then will take the photo fine. i havn't found it myself, dont know if anyone else has? but you cant seem to keep flash on for every photo, the camera will decide whether it has flash or not, and i really like to have flash on most of the time.

Ie on a night out...

My last camera was a Canon Ixus 70 which was brilliant but died due to water damage, and was pleased that not only were the controls and menus very similar, but the batteries were identical, so I already have a spare. Haven't printed any photos yet, but they look great on screen.|#|None as yet

8.0|#|Outstanding quality pictures and Hi-Def video. Very quick to turn up - no delay taking photos (never miss a special moment!). HD video recording is amazing - better than having a camcorder at 720p resolution. The thinnest camera I have seen with these features - slips into jeans pockets with ease. Recommend getting a genuine Canon case and a large SD card (minimum 8GB)|#|HD Movies are in a format that can be difficult to play - without a top-of-the-range computer the video playback on Windows is poor (stutters) or audio is not synchronised. This is not a fault of the camera - the HD video files created (.MOV) are high quality and intact, you just need a high-quality media player to play them! Try GOM on a high-performance PC.  I play them back on the WDTV Media Player connected to my HDTV via HDMI after first converting the audio using the mov2avi utility.

9.0|#|A neat compact little camera that doesn't have too many features to make it complicated. Great if you want a camera for taking holiday snaps that fits in your pocket.|#|
10.0|#|It was very simple  for me to use as I'm not a professional photographer.|#|I don't know yet about any bad point. The only thing I know is that I videoed  a bit and my card was full so quick. I thought the card was 4GB. My nephew will check it and let me know whether I filmed too much.

5.0|#|Good quality pictures|#|Cannot believe that I had to purchase a memory card.  Until I did I could not take any pictures.
8.0|#|Very light compact camera. Whilst it is not Canon's latest model, on average it produces excellent quality photos|#|The back coating on the camera has started to come of quicker than expected. Some images taken in low light are not clear on Auto setting
10.0|#|This is a great go-anywhere camera. Superbly portable and wonderful images - including reduced light. I have used it every day for 3 weeks on holiday and the battery was still almost full - after over 160 images. An excellent buy.|#|Can't think of one.

10.0|#|Will also record video in HD.|#|
10.0|#|Ideal for slipping into handbag or pocket, no bulk. Being a 'point and shoot' user it is very easy, However I have been tempted to experiment a little. Having a viewfinder was really important for me as I have difficulty with the screen when it is sunny. So far I am delighted with the camera.|#|The 'Getting Started' Manual was far too basic and the Manuals Disk for use with the computer was far too inconvenient for me to use, so my son downloaded and printed the much larger 'Camera User Guide' which was a lot more use to me. I haven't yet found any bad points with the camera.
9.0|#|Easy to carry.Tele photo good.Quality and photos very good.|#|On off button to awkward.View finder to small.Difficult to hold needs a case..

10.0|#|Great pictures, very compact and easy to carry.|#|Lots to learn on how to operate all the features. Small instruction booklet but full information on CD. Would like to be able to keep flash turned off for some photos but when you turn camera off and then on again the flash is automatically on.
9.0|#|Very compact and all in all takes a great photo.|#|When zooming in pictures become blurred.
10.0|#|Takes very good and fast photo's, perfect for my wife storing it in her handbag ready to take pics of the kids at the drop of a hat. If you are expecting a camera with slr like zoom etc then this won't be what you need, if however you want a good solid camera for taking quick photo's and that gives a good picture and is very compact then this one will fit the bill. Filled with good and well thought out features that some at twice the price struggle to have, excellent picture quality for such a small camera. It takes loads of photo's on one battery charge. All in all a good buy. I'd say the best camera in its range|#|None that I can think off, apart from the wife hides it in her handbag so I never get to use it!
7.0|#|value for money|#|apart from that its great little pocket camera.
9.0|#|The fact it is so small means you can pop it in your pocket and carry it around a;ll the time so I find myself taking much more pictures that I did with my old compact camera.|#|Controls might be a bit too small for someone with large hands, it may actually be 'too small' for some people.

8.0|#|Its very small for carrying around. Takes good pictures but havent used it enough to comment further|#|Being very small it is rather fiddly. That said I would buy it again.
9.0|#|Small, extremely portable yet still takes lovely pictures and preserves the manual settings that I love about Canon cameras.|#|Wish it were easier to find a case that matches it perfectly. The one that I got free with my camera (Swordfish) is great colour and of course, great quality, but just a little bit too big...
9.0|#|Sleek design.|#|Some images come out a bit more blurred than with other cameras and pictures take slightly longer to take.

8.0|#|I am very impressed and would highly recommend this to anyone! Worth every penny!|#|The only negatives i could mention is that if you wanted to use all the features of the camera, due to it's small size, the buttons are obviously very small so will be a tad fiddly. But in reality that is not what this camera is about, it takes good quality pictures without the need change settings for conditions. If that's what you want, this is the camera for you.

9.0|#|Very Compact with reasonable battery life and takes a decent picture. Has a view finder as well for sunny days on the ski slopes!|#|A manual focus would still be useful every once in a while.
9.0|#|Amazingly there are very few compact cameras now available with viewfinders. Anyone who has tried to take pictures outdoors cannot usually compose their picture without, even with additional shields (have noticed even canon is stopping this feature-which is stupid). Camera neat and compact. Not yet had a lot of use but have taken both still and video.|#|The viewfinder is good but it would be better if not quite as close to the edge of the body.

8.0|#|Living in Malta with bright sunlight all year round, I needed a good camera with an optical viewfinder. This is the best I found in the category and the price range I was seeking.|#|I would have preferred a 5x optical zoom instead of 3x. This camera would have been the very perfect choice.
8.0|#|Great size, small and light.|#|Didn't come with case.

10.0|#|The camera is very handy, easy to use. I use it as a second camera to my DSLR. I don't always have the DSLR on me but the Ixus 100 is always in my pocket ready to shoot and I love it. I can take pictures whenever I need to and the quality is very good and it also features HD movies which is pretty impressive.|#|I was missing a SD card as part of the purchase but it seems to be standard that these are not included with the camera. Would be nice to have a kit with SD card so one is ready to shoot with the camera right out of the box.
9.0|#|I like the fact that it has a viewfinder.  I don't need to put my reading glasses on to take a picture and if it is very bright the screen is sometimes difficult to see.  Lovely photos particularly if subject is moving.  I took some great photos of my grand daughter jumping in the water on holiday.|#|The buttons are a bit small but with a tiny camera that is to be expected - I am glad I have stopped biting my nails!

7.0|#|Feature rich, nice little camera, good video, great to carry around in pocket.|#|Noisy pics with auto (anything above ISO 100). I guess too many pixels for such a tiny optic coupled with trying to balance this out during processing causes this noise.

9.0|#|I wanted a camera that was really easy to use, that takes great photo's and that is what I got.|#|A bit noisy.
8.0|#|Controls very easy to use.  On screen menu self explanatory.  Large display screen.  Zoom control incredibly easy to operate.  Picks out faces and shows green box around the central focussing element.  By moving the camera slightly, you can change where the camera focuses.  Excellent battery life.  Can see on screen how many shots you have left.  Instruction book very easy to understand.  Auto setting makes point and shoot very simple and produces excellent results.|#|Fireworks setting produces really weird visual effects.  For night time shots, pixels go down to 3mp.  Flash fires automatically on every setting unless you remember to cancel it.

10.0|#|A typical Nikon - good solid feel and produces excellent quality output. The large screen makes reviewing images a breeze. Mac users, get the Nikon RAW converter for Aperture, plug in and go.|#|Lots of features mean lots of buttons - bewildering to begin with, but a thick book to help.
10.0|#|High spec and good build quality. It has a good array of features and the controls are easy to find. Comprehensive menu which is easy to navigate. The camera feels substantial in the hands without feeling bulky.|#|Cannot fault it.
9.0|#|Solid build, great image quality, spot metering, 10 MP, very easy to use.|#|No anti-dust. No image stabilisor (not a problem if VR lenses are used though).
9.0|#|The nikon d80 is a brilliant camera, In a hour or so it seems like you have owned it for years it is so easy to use, the image quality is very good.|#|None, but I think Nikon should brought out a DX 100- 300 zoom, they stopped at 55-200
9.0|#|Very fast focus-tracking ability comparing to canon 350D. Very good handling and clear menu.|#|I had to exchange the camera as there was hot and dead pixels on the censor but the new one works perfectly fine :)
10.0|#|Handling is excellent, all function buttons are at fingertips.  In camera menus are simple to configure.|#|Packaged software is not very comprehensive.  New SD cards can be lost down the couch!

10.0|#|Fast and reliable workhorse, good battery life and extensive features makes the EOS30D a joy to use.|#|None to speak of.
9.0|#|As I expected from Nikon the camera is very good.  As it is my only camera it fits with my ability, and what I was prepared to spend. I also purchased a 18-200 VR lens to go with the camera.|#|None for me, I would have bought a D200 but it was to expensive for me.

10.0|#|Serious camera combines sophisticated SLR with powerful digital processing. Handles well, copes with everything from point and shoot to creative work.|#|None
8.0|#|Chunky, robust and high quality camera, easy to hold and use. We've got the ultra-wide angle lens fitted as an option, and the panorama shots are truly impressive. Large LCD screen for reviewing images, all the controls fall neatly to hand, and for the price, you get a lot of pixels for your money.|#|Can take ages to photograph a detailed shot - whether you've got noise reduction on or off, and whether you're in landscape or auto modes. You can't preview the shot on the LCD screen, so you have to use the viewfinder, and there's no way to turn off the shutter noise which makes it impractical for photographing conference speakers, for instance.
9.0|#|Big solid build.  Plenty of camera to hold onto if one has large hands. Very user friendly.  Very good quality pictures.|#|None apparent.
9.0|#|As you would expect with anything Canon it's fantastic, the build quality is spot on, no loose bits or things that just dont quite work. Mines been through the Sahara Desert, and always continues to do exactly what it says on the box.|#|If I had more money I'd buy the 5D or if I won the lottery I'd buy the 1DS

10.0|#|This is a great camera with excellence image quality and very simple to use, its also has a very large screen which with zoom and crop image features|#|I like the body of my old D70, the D80 is a smaller body which is suprising  with all the added extra features
9.0|#|among us. The ability to manipulate shots  after taking them  allows for errors when using non CPU lens.|#|none
8.0|#|It's a Nikon product which gives it a flying start. Layout and function are familiar from D50 experience. 10 Mpixel resolution is just right for my purposes to enable cropping of images and still be able achieve good sized prints. It has more facilities (D-lighting, extra focus points, etc.) than my previous D50 - with which I was very pleased.|#|Lack of anti-dust facilities as per D60 or Canon. Apart from that nothing (taking price into account).
9.0|#|brilliant clear photos|#|beware of slightest  knock have damaged the digital display
9.0|#|Good size display, excellent image quality, the overall weight and feel of the camera lets you know you are holding a good quality SLR.

10.0|#|The software suite with the camera is also very good although it isn't a photoshop.|#|Can't really think of anything except maybe a bit pricey and ocassionaly the autofocus goes a bit crazy -- but that's probably user error!
9.0|#|great camera excellent image quality|#|none
8.0|#|Contains a lot of the features of the more expensive D200 without the extra bulk of that camera.  As light and portable as the D50 but with more quality and advanced features.|#|Instruction book isn't the world's best read!  Having two command dials takes some getting used to.

10.0|#|It's a professional camera, it takes professional pictures. It has a good solid feel. It does low light shots very well.|#|There is a tendency to overexposure on sunny days resulting in loss of detail, so you have to stop back a bit; this is more marked with the Nikon 50-200 mm lens than the Signa 28-50 mm.

9.0|#|Great handling camera with plenty of great features for the discerning amatuer. Fantastic high ISO performance and image quality. The kit lens is an OK starter lens but to take advantage of the fantastic CMOS sensor, quality glass is recommended. I have the EF-S 17-55 f2.8 IS and EF 70-200 f4 IS which are ideal companions for walkabout. I also have some specialist primes for more creative shots.

Does not have HD video (don't have a real need for it at the moment).

9.0|#|An excellent camera for those considering a compact camera to compliment their SLR, or someone wanting to experiment with more creative shooting modes (manual, aperture priority etc).|#|Expensive! However, not as pricey as a G11, and has the same sensor.
10.0|#|This is simply the best compact I have owned. I bought this as a companion to my DSLR and for shooting when I don't want to carry a lot of equipment.|#|It's a bit on the pricey side.
9.0|#|A digital camera with a high specification. It is small and compact so can replace a DSLR when it is not convenient to carry a heavy and larger camera. It produces pictures equaly as good  as a DSLR of similar specification and will even take RAW pictures which is certainly a plus for the experienced amateur. Although there is no view finder this is no disadvantage except in very strong sunlight. However the LDC screen is quite bright and works quite well in framing a shot. The zoom range is limited but easily controlled with the large ring around the lens.|#|There are few bad points such as the circular control on the back of the camera which can be moved accidentally when setting the rocker switch controls.  In the centre of all this is the function control wich is very small and needs care when operating it so that other switches are not altered. The cd which comes with the camera contains a very full instruction manual but has to be printed out as continual reference is necessary when first operating the camera. It would be helpful to have a full printed manual but that of course would add to the cost.
9.0|#|Great camera. For a small compact it takes fantastic quality pictures. Really, there is little you can't love about this camera.|#|Shame because otherwise, you can't fault this camera.

8.0|#|Image quality is good bearing in mind this is a compact camera.  It is very compact and easily carried in a shirt pocket.  Battery life is good.  Low light level image quality is good , ISO 800 pictures are quite acceptable.  Makes a good second camera to partner a DSLR.|#|Small size means it's a bit tricky to use sometimes. Not that good on AUTO mode (tends to use too high ISO at expense of picture quality) really need to take more control with P, Tv or Av etc.  I set ISO to 80 and use P mode. Video quality only AVI so not up to latest HD.

It just doesn't feel right in your hands.  It's not comfortable at all.  I have to use two hands on many occasions becuase the camera feels like it's slipping from my hands when I use one.  The design team needs to be fired over this one.  I cannot believe they could not come up with a better design.

10.0|#|It takes amazing pictures.  On my last camera I always had to set up the motion function to catch anything not standing still, but this captured a wallaby mid-bounce just on the auto function.  I love the scroll wheel (especially when you need to find the pic you want quickly) an the fact that you can bulk erase selected pictures rather than having to do them one at a time, or erase the whole lot.  The LCD screen is a good size, and once you've taken pics and rotate the camera in your hand, the pic moves round too, a bit like on an iPhone.|#|Only thing I think they need to add to the package is an in car charger for the battery, as currently you can only charge it off the mains.
10.0|#|The camera is small light and extremely easy to use.  The quality of the photos taken were excellent, you dont have to be an expert to use this camera.  The wide angled feature is extremely useful, especially when taking panoramic photos, which you can also stitch together with the software available from cannon.|#|None that I have found yet.

Have only just started using it, but, so far, it has coped very well with some difficult conditions and I am very happy with it.|#|Difficult to see the display screen; a view finder would have been good. The flash, which comes up automatically, has been commented on by others as a nuisance. I don't find this a problem, and an advantage is that you don't forget to use the flash when needed.
9.0|#|LCD display. Good build quality.|#|Also the wrist strap is too big and serves no real purpose. Wrist straps on the IXUS range with a sliding ring are much better, hence the camera stays attatched to your wrist!!
10.0|#|Nice big and clear display.|#|A bit bigger than many other compact digital cameras but that's a small price to pay for the zoom and resolution.

9.0|#|Great camera, excellent number of features and takes amazing photo's.|#|The pop-up flash is a little annoying because it sits where you hand hold the camera ... but the quality of the camera outweighs this issue and you soon get used to it!
9.0|#|Switches well between best-fit settings when on automatic.  Takes crisp, clear photos in lots of different conditions.|#|Quite chunky-looking.  Lens jammed with tiny amount of sand blown onto it at beach.
9.0|#|Vaguely retro styling is very appealing.|#|It tends to over-expose on auto although you need a photographer's eye to be overly concerned by this in most shots
9.0|#||#|It would be useful to have a viewfinder as a screen alone is inadequate out of doors when the sun is shining.
9.0|#|Weight|#|The cover for the USB port is plastic and tacky, detracts from the build quality. The pop-up flash cannot be retracted while the camera is switched on. This makes holding the camera slightly awkward for the left hand.

10.0|#|This is a great litle camera. It isn't as small as our previous cameras as we do tend to prefer compact models but this performs brilliantly. We took it on holiday and have some fantastic scenery and sunset shots. The viewing screen is a really good size. Since purchasing the camera for ourselves we have also bought it for our father who is equally impressed. There is a setting which is for capturing moving children and pets which works excellently...we have some great images of our lively dog and niece and nephew who are always on the move!|#|The pop up flash takes a little getting used to but the performance outweighs this small problem.

Battery life is good.  It feels good in the hand and is very easy to operate.  When I have time, I will look into the manual use but with the other options, this hardly seems necessary!|#|Camera strap is too short.  I like to attach the camera to a belt or bag in order that if it is dropped, it won't hit the floor or more important, others have little chance of removing it from your possession.

8.0|#|Once you get used to the navigational and manual features, it is a breeze to use with a user friendy interface to boot. Macro photography and HD movie record is a definate stong feature for the camera. A decent sized camera for fun and experimental photography.|#|This is a my second one as the first suffered a cracked screen  with a little accidental pressure . It is a weighty product and is quite fragile to handle. My advice, don't get too adventurous unless you have insurance for peace of mind.

8.0|#|Very impressed with the results, especially with using the Manual setting.|#|The biggest draw-back with this is that it eats up batteries. It takes only 2 AAs (my previous Canon had 4) and even Duracells lasted only a day or two on holiday. Rechargables are obviously the ones to use with this model. Also, when uploading the photos onto computer using the software provided, changing the target directory and generic image nameis very fiddly. The software with my previous Canon allowed the user to change both directly from the import dialog.

9.0|#|Really good quality and easy to use.  We haven't learned a fraction, yet, of the camera's capabilities, but we are very impressed.  The camera is a really good bridge between an SLR and compact.|#|Not easy to see the image on the screen in sunlight, so taking photos can be a bit of a lottery - made worse by my photo-chromic glasses.  A little pull-out awning over the screen  might take care of this
9.0|#|excellent image quality and 10x zoom. Loads of features including manual control.  Small enough to fit in your bag and good size screen.  Very good value for money compared to similar spec compacts.|#|Would have liked a view finder as sometimes its difficult to see the image on the screen without getting a reflection.  A bit difficult to open battery compartment quickly !

10.0|#|excellent image quality, usable images upto iso 1600 and beyond if you're printing A4, fast accurate af, no problems at all, nice file size allows a little cropping if needed, 1D build quality but that's what you'd expect, nice screen compared to the other 1D range|#|A little too expensive, the screen is good but can make a slightly out of focus picture appear sharp, the af settings could be all in one menu rather then custom settings but a minor nit really, the video mode, though useful for some was something Im not going to use, I'd prefer a cheaper version without this option.
10.0|#|Great camera with great images and power. The FPS are a wonderful thing. Buying this camera takes lots of thought and research but I can assure you that once you own it you'll not regret your decision.|#|Cost, but you get what you pay for and this is one mega-camera.
9.0|#|Robustness ,pictures quality ,noise management ( especially in low light), quickness...|#|nothing for the moment....
9.0|#|This camera allows you to keep autofocus when using a 1.4 or 2 x extender depending on the lens used. Autofocus is still possible at f 8. It has many custom functions, but you only need to use the ones, which are helpful and suit your type of photography. It is rather intimidating at first, but the internet has lots of advice and then put everything into practice. It is a solid made camera with a good feel to it. The weight is reasonable and with a long lens is still not uncomfortable. HD video is easy to use and superb.|#|None that I have found.
9.0|#|The camera has exceptional build quality and is extremely rugged. Its very adaptable to different situations making it very versatile. The image quality is the best I have seen yet in a canon body and I cant wait to use it more.|#|It has movie mode which I very much doubt I'll use, therefore I personally would have prefered them to leave this out and make the camera cheaper.
10.0|#|I have ben using the !D Mark III for wildlife photography and have been pleased with the resulting images.  The results from friends who have bought the 1D Mark IV were even better, especially where image cropping was required.  It is very fast with massive flexibility on focusing points. It is superbly robust and water resistant.  It also provides incredibly fast focusing with my range of AF/IS lenses. I also find the ISO range is much better than the MkIII. I get very little noise even at 800 ASA.|#|The main one is that against a dull background focusing of moving objects becomes difficult but still better than the MkIII.  Also the point focus is not as good as the 7D which I also have. However, the 7D has for me some noise above 400ASA.

9.0|#|Great camera with beautiful images produced from it. Its extremely well made and robust. Very customisable. Great screen and controls.|#|Its quite heavy and its complicated to set up. I would prefer having a video button to start and stop video
10.0|#|Fantastic build quality and features, with picture quality to go with it.|#|None found, yet.
8.0|#|I previously a pair of 1D Mark II's for 7 years.  I loved those cameras and got some great images from them over the years.  But, the Mark IV is a huge improvement to the II's.  The ISO range is wonderful, the battery life is absolutely incredible, and the extra resolution gives me a lot of options when needing to crop a little.|#|After having owned the Mark II's so long, I got real familiar with the controls.  I'm still trying figure out a few of the equivalent controls on the Mark IV.
9.0|#|Fantastic camera|#|None so far
9.0|#|Really great low light ability, no image drop when a field monitor is plugged in to the hdmi slot|#|full frame should have been involved due to the cost and maybe an extra frame rate higher then 50fps like 120fps for slow mo and a raw codec
9.0|#|It does everything that the 50D does but has the video option which is fantastic. I didnt realise that you can also take a still photo whilst in video mode until I read the manual. The quick control screen is a major bonus over my old 350D. Being able to change ISO, Image quality and metering in seconds really helps with my nature and bird photography. Although the build quality is not the same as the 50D its lightness helps when carrying all my lenses with tripods when birding.|#|Only one. Why does the flash pop up in good light whilst in automatic mode. I still havent figured out how to stop it. Can anyone help.
9.0|#|provides common (or difficult to find) options quickly. Creative modes allow beginners to use it as well as more experienced users. Excellent screen display and resolution. Resdesigned grip is excellent. Depth of Field setting provides quite good results, but usually badly fails to include all captured focussing points when using flash.|#|Live View is fiddly and not quick to focus. 20fps on HD video is sadly short of 30fsp, but its OK I guess? High ASA settings negated by Auto Picture corrections (in Custom Functions), meaning limit on ASA top settings. Why on earth Canon decided to put the video start/stop button separate to the shutter release I don't know!
9.0|#|The quality of image, High ISO level in dark conditions and HD movie are the strengths of this product|#|I am still looking for...
8.0|#|Very small and light comapred to my main 5D Mark II body, easy to use, favourites menu, built in flash.|#|Reduction in resolution and contrast is noticeable compared to 5DII, but as it is less than a third of the price, this has to be taken into account.  Personally I  would only use the 500D up ISO800.
9.0|#|It continues the build quality that I have learnt to expect from Canon|#|doesn't always present information in logical sequence. There are occasional instances of a lack of familiarity with standard english.
9.0|#|Ease of use,  fairly intuitive controls,  large high-def screen.  I bought this to replace an ageing EOS300D which was brilliant,  except that with slightly failing eyesight the controls and indicators were getting a bit difficult to read.  The large display on the 500D  is a major improvement in that respect.|#|A bit flimsier than the 300D....  fingernails seem to mark the plastic near the handgrip quite easily.... only a cosmetic thing,  though.
10.0|#|I can still use my original lenses from the 350D so it has saved me money.   It is very simple to use and the photographs are outstanding when viewed either on the computer or TV screen through the DVD player.|#|None that I have found
9.0|#|Fantastic screen, good photo image quality|#|None found yet
10.0|#|Allows you to point and shoot with very little set up but also has the capability to let you select all settings manually. With the addition of Full HD video makes it a very comprehensive and versatile camera for the price. Also will take all EF/EFS lenses|#|LCD display is fixed in the back which restricts its use but is viewable at an angle which helps a bit but a fully articulated screen would have made the camera unbeatable at the price.

9.0|#|I have been using the 400D for 3 years, and have found that the upgrade to the 500D is currently good value. I wanted the extra quality of 14 bits rather than 12, and the extra few mega pixels. I also wanted to move to SD cards. Live view and camcorder modes are not essential to me, but work pretty well and are a nice bonus. I also think that some of the menu options have been improved, and I like the addition of spot metering. I have played with the raw images in Adobe Camera Raw, and the improved quality has so far not disappointed.|#|The battery life is not as good as previous models, and I'm not sure why the button for switching between metering modes has been relegated to a menu option. This is something that I use often, so this is slightly iritating.

9.0|#|Additional features such as video (HD) introduced but a pity we have to use the screen instead of viewfinder|#|Battery life now much shorter due to power absorbed by stabiliser

10.0|#|good quality product|#|none
9.0|#|Having previously purchased a 450D, the extra features of the 500D justified the purchase of  the 500 D body. The extra pixels, the extra range of ISO and the option to use as a cam 'corder proved excellent value for money.  Not only that but I could now keep my canon 17 - 40 mm lens on one body and my Tamron 18 - 270 mm lens on the other body. Allowing me the option of lens without the interchangable aspect.|#|None, only regret not getting the 500D sooner.

10.0|#|Compact, and has own special battery and charger so charges from mains and doesn't use up our other general rechargeable batteries.|#|
9.0|#|A good, small, quality build camera which is compact and easy to carry in a shirt pocket if you need to.  Good features for a compact camera and I would recommend it.|#|We bought a case with the camera to match the body.  Unfortunately the case is a shade of blue which is good for girls, but not blokes if you know what I mean.
7.0|#|Good value for money. Bought it to replace a Panasonic Lumix FS10 that I lost - This camera was less money and performs better. Overall happy with the results.|#|Only thing I have noticed is that sometimes there is a red line on the LED screen - don't know if I should be worried about this but it only occurs occasionaly and disappears again.
9.0|#|Its a very good buy for somebody that needs an everyday digital camera that doesnt cost a fortune. It takes quality pictures day and night (brightest sunshine and nightclubs) even on auto, saving the hassle of messing around with the ISO. The images dont come out blurry (and im an amateur) and are best when the flash is on (even during the day). Close up images (flowers, any people that try semi-professional nice pictures from an angle or just focusing the front bit of the image) are absolutely amazing. The wide lense is a lovely feature, even I wasnt expecting to make such a nice difference. Would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera for everyday/holiday use, Im sure its nothing you will regret!|#|8 on image quality), though that might be due to only standard auto settings I use, as I tend to prefer the point-and-shoot. More features/functions might be more fun, though for the cost it is a good selection.
9.0|#|For price, this camera offers an excellent alternative to more expensive brands which do basically the same thing. It's small, compact and versatile with good image quality. Feature menus are well set out making quick adjustments to your image easy.|#|In low light quality the image quality suffers a little. However, with a more thorough understanding of the camera features this can probably be overcome.

8.0|#|A highly versatile camera, with many of the same features available on the 'higher end' 7D semi-pro model. I was planning on purchasing the 7D, but having felt the sheer weight of this camera and compared the spec with that of the 550D, only the shooting speed and minor differences in sensor processing seem different to me. The lighter body of the 550D, and much lighter price, swayed me. Whilst the top dial presets suggest it is marketed as a 'beginner' dslr, there is plenty for the more serious amateur to get to grips with. Indeed, the fact that I haven't really captured the quality of photo I was hoping for as yet suggests that 'tweaking' is an important skill to get the best from it.|#|Not sure the quality of the kit lens is a match for the quality of the camera. I'm a little disappointed at the results indoors, where I thought the DSLR would really shine over my little FUJI, but there isn't that much difference. I'm considering splashing out on a better lens (as I saved several hundreds of pounds against the 7D), such as the 1.4 50mm, or even the 'cheapy' 1.8 50mm - which I hope will generate even better results, especially of portraits of my family.
9.0|#|Great Camera, very pleased!!!|#|Finding a good memory card that can handle the HD video speed - I bought a new Samsung 16GB SDHC class 6 card (550D (Canon) said the card had to be a minimum class 6) the card worked great for stills but was not fast enough for video. I have now purchased a Transcend 16GB class 10 SDHC - internet reviews indicate this card can handle the video so lets wait and see, in short check the cards are proven to handle HD video in 550D before purchase just any old class 6 card may not work!
10.0|#|Solid, well designed camera with the feel of a great film camera.  Great viewfinder.  Really like the sensor that makes the rear viewfinder picture image disappear when you put the camera to your face. Quality of the lens and the images are extraordinary.   Loads and loads of clever features which will take me months to work through.  I was an avid Film EOS user, and am really pleased so far with this new digital version.|#|None
9.0|#|The Canon EF-S 18-135 Lens is a reasonable good all rounder, especially when on holiday.|#|The Canon 550D does not have a swing out LCD viewing screen which makes low level photography difficult, unless you buy an additional viewing screen.
9.0|#|Battery life is also excellent.|#|Shame the rear screen doesnt come with a screen protector, but thats easily rectified with aftermarket ones available
9.0|#|Having previously purchased the Canon 300D and 400D cameras, I had no reservation in purchasing the 550D as an upgrade. The camera produces outstanding performance with ultra crisp sharpness. I was very surprised at the quality of the images from 6400ASA setting which corresponded to that from the 800ASA setting on the 400D. All the features are ergonomically laid out for ease of operation and no twitching fingers which could unintentionally change the ASA setting as on the 400D.|#|The battery and memory card are not interchangeable with the 400D but are of superior quality, otherwise I can't fault the product.
9.0|#|The camera is very fast to operate in manual mode with nice clear menus and display. Although I found I use it most in aperture priority mode.  The bundled 18-55mm lens is better than expected too.  I bought it with this lens as I can't afford the lens I really want yet and thought this would get me started. I was very impressed with it.|#|mode it's slower than I expected for still images because the mirror has to lift out of the way so I don't use that feature except when shooting video.
10.0|#|The performance across the range is at the point where the most important/limiting thing that effects the photographs that you take is the lens not the camera itself -- save on the body by buying the 550D and put the money towards 'L' series lenses!|#|(Portrait, Landscape etc) ones
10.0|#|The video quality is great although it can be a bit tricky at times.|#|Also when shooting using the built in mic you get the noises of the lense and focusing picked up in the film.
9.0|#|manufacturing methods. After over five decades of serious commitment to the chemical process and to low tech, high build quality, equipment, I took some winning over to the value of the digital process. The 550D is not just a high tech lump of plastic, as I would so often regard such kit, but has the potential for serious image production. Once I accepted that it is not a Lieca, a Hassle, or a Broni, I was able to settle down to some serious photography.|#|What am I to do, now, with the darkroom ?

The results from the camera are very pleasing, the auto focus and range of metering options are excellent.|#|I have found no bad points as yet.
10.0|#|So versatile. A good mid-range camera with excellent still and movie capabilities. Compares very well with the direct competition.|#|Intensive instruction booklet. Would recommend slightly larger type face is used. Canon accessories are very expensive compared to the compatible stuff like lenses.
10.0|#|It's perfect! The quality of video is amazing! And the camera itself is quite light!|#|Not enough zoom for me, but that's the matter of the lens
10.0|#|having used a hybrid DSLR / Compact style camera for the last 3 years (Panasonic DMC-FZ18) i needed to upgrade to a better more professional style DSLR camera, and this fits the bill perfectly.  It has great ability to control every aspect of each shot to the finest of changes in Exposure, DOF, Focus, Flash adjustments which makes taking photos a lot more fun as the result can be viewed using the DOF preview button before you click.  I have not used the on-screen preview as i prefer using the eye-piece.  This camera has taken my photography skills and results to a higher level.|#|the on-body lenses are very expensive and can cost as much as the camera did for the mid-range models.  i wish the kit lens had a longer zoom length as this is something i really miss from my old camera.

10.0|#|Now on my third Canon DSLR having previously owned the 300D and 350D. The 550D is nothing short of superb. Was going to buy when it first came out but decided to soldier on with the excellent 350D and wait for the price to reduce. When it did, I bought it and have been more than impressed, especially in low light conditions.|#|Still trying to find one!
9.0|#|An awesome entry-level DSLR with a great kit lens.  The body and lens is of a good build quality.  The menu system is simple, with many beginner and more advanced features.  The LCD is large, bright and crystal clear.|#|I recommend purchasing the Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS telephoto lens, as the EF-S 18-55mm IS kit lens is only suitable for portrait and wide-angle shots.  The built-in flash is also not great (but this is the same with all DSLRs), and you might want to purchase a separate flash unit.
9.0|#|If you have had a Canon before it's like meeting an old friend who has had a makeover. Very easy to use, clear menus, lovely to hold.|#|I can't think of any, its a fab camera in the price range. The kit lens is a bit limiting but most people have/buy other lens to go with it.

8.0|#|It does what it says on the tin and does it well. I haven't had the opportunity to explore all the features and I am sure there are many I will never fully use. The image quality is great which was one of the main deciding factors for choosing it.|#|The battery life is OK, but if you are going out or away and expect to use it heavily probably worth getting a second one.
9.0|#|The 550d has quality written all over it, would recommend a flash gun though, image quality is superb in particular using RAW setting.|#|None so far
9.0|#|Image quality is superb and obviously the Image stabiliser in the lens helps to shoot at lowere shutter speeds than ever before. Other than the comment below I cannot fault this camera.|#|Several times I have knocked the program dial when switching the camera on and off. The dial seems a bit too easy to turn in this respect and I have found myself shooting in Manual instead of  AV. Maybe it's me being clumsy but wonder if anyone else has noticed this.
10.0|#|image quality is on par with the canon 7d, hd video is great.  typical canon menu system, works well.  quite a light camera, so maybe a battery pack would give better balance for some.  doesnt have the build quality and weight of the 7d and comparible camera - but then it costs a huge amount less.  somewhat smaller than 7d and similar too, but this isnt necessarily a bad thing.  all in all brilliant cam for the money, punches well above its weight, iso noise control is astounding.|#|none

10.0|#|Canon 550d is a very good camera for budding photo ensuastic like me. It produce a good quality image, and with a small hand i can handle it features with such an ease. And it also produce a good video. I intend to use the camera for photos only but sometimes you really can capture precious moment with a great video which is very handy with this model. Price-wise, i think i got myself a bargain.|#|Why did canon name the same camera in different country. 550d in UK and T-rebel for USA. It just confusing for us amateur whos looking for a descent dslr.
10.0|#|The screen menu and buttons are easy to use/ navigate for an amaetuer like myself and the jog dial is excellent. Produces very good quality images.|#|However, I also use a 55-250 mm IS lens and focusing at the telephoto end might be a liitle slow for just point an shoot- which I assume is expected I suppose.
10.0|#|How long do you have? There are so many - too many to mention... okay, how about the self timer shot.  Not one, but you can take multiple shots in the same sitting giving you the option to pick a great image instead of having to retake.  Loved this feature.  The screen, live view, video - YES video and it's fab.  HD recording... SD card expanson.  Superb build quality coupled with a nice cannon lens.  You'll soon be wanting to upgrade the lens if you're into amateur wildlife or photography that needs a photo zoom, such as planespotting  - while I am mainly using this camera for.|#|Not cheaper - a bit below the belt but that would be the only bad point in my book.

9.0|#|Bought after fairly extensive research but opted for this over Nikon 3100 / 5100 and Eos1100d (poor build quality). Whilst the EOS600d was also available this was much more expensive for little gain (flexible lcd screen). Overall very satisfied with 5550d. Easy to use, great picture quality and lots of manual options to explore.|#|Build quality is ok but slightly plasticky. Overall feels like it can take the odd knock or two. Much better builder quality than 1100d.
10.0|#|New metering mode gives really good white balance, compare to my old DSLR. High ISO, which makes picture fully usable/printable even with slow shutter speed. Gotta say, the kit lens really surprised me. I was expecting it to be completely useless, but it's quite good. What about movie mode, it shoots 1080p videos 24/25/30 fps - what else you need?! The best thing about 550D is it's price.|#|Built quality. But no, don't imagine that it's made out of CocaCola bottle, like I did before i took it to my hands. The worst thing about the built quality to me is probably main dial's, reduce/magnify buttons and maybe (not sure) even shutter button quality. Talking about the video mode, well there's no continuous AF during filming and the mic catches every little noise from the camera itself, like manual focusing. But all these flaws comes to a body/it's built quality. Note that I couldn't find any cons in picture/video quality or camera performance.

10.0|#|what can i say, it's my first slr camera and it's as good as i expected, i suppose for what i paid it should be top quality pictures, quite easy to use  not to heavy but most of all image qualty is stunning, 1080hp video mode is fantastic|#|cannot believe not supplied with lens hood, most cameras come with a lens hood. 1080hp movie mode is fantastic but uses so much memory  12mins of filming will use about 4gb.

9.0|#|- Well built.|#|- Also the lens you get in the bundle isn't great, but once you buy a slightly more expensive lens there isn't really anything to complain about.
8.0|#|really super, fairly compact camera -can't go wrong with the automatic setting, so you get great quality pictures immediately while you learn how to use the other functions properly|#|not a bad point but a wish that perhaps you could offer a left handed version! Find it slightly awkward to focus with my right hand....but getting better with practice
10.0|#|This is my first DSLR and it's a great camera, easy to use, build quality as expected of a Canon product.|#|None so far!
8.0|#|Really good mid-range Canon DSLR, fairly easy to use and change settings. You can get some cracking images once you get used to customising and working in the various modes.|#|The build quality doesn't feel excellent to me, also the prices aren't what Id call truly reflective for a mid-range DSLR.

9.0|#|Brilliant Beginner Entry level Camera, Build quality is sturdy and feels great.|#|Menu system is a bit complex and slightly intimidating for a beginner
10.0|#|it is far easy then most cams for showing you all whats on offer on the top of the cam, its not heavy and its made really well and isnt too big.|#|havent found any bad points as of yet
10.0|#|Picture quality at all levels|#|None as yet
9.0|#|The camera is also lightweight and relatively compact.|#|The zoom is not that great if you want to take shots of something in the distance. I'd recommend buying a larger lens in addition (and its worth spending a bit extra for an IS lens).
10.0|#|Excellent brand (of course). Being a total beginner I find the many auto settings invaluable. Of course as experience is gained the many personalised settings can then be utilised. This means great photos can be taken almost immediately, without having to wade through a comprehensive instruction manual.|#|None.
9.0|#|User friendly, with a vast array of features that you would find on a more expensive mid entry camera. Video mode is exceptional with the ability to create quite stunning broadcast quality creations|#|I had the misfortune to drop my camera only 4 days after recieving it and although it was in a camera bag, the front piece below the flash broke off and the flash is smashed. I can only use the cameras with high iso until I can get an external flash or try to get it fixed.
10.0|#|Great little camera|#|none yet
9.0|#|Very easy to use and I am a beginner. Currently on a short course to learn how to use it better!|#|Could have come with a small case but just came on it own.
9.0|#|Everything, can be used as point and shoot or for some really creative pics|#|The nly thing i can thing of is the lens cap is not attached to the camera when removed
10.0|#|Very easy to use, Some good features for an entry level DSLR, It feels to have a good build quality, Very good image quality, Manual settings are very easy to use. Very good value camera and if you are moving from a Bridge or a better Point and Shoot you won't be disappointed.|#|haven't found any yet
10.0|#|Accessories easy to find|#|None yet!
8.0|#|Feels good to use - as a totally amateur user I could pick it up, set it to auto and take some really good looking pics.|#|Manual is very difficult for a raw beginner
10.0|#|Has a CA screen where you can easily get to a variety of changes in one screen in cases where you need to take different photos quickly.|#|Flap over connection doesn't look like it'll last long.
10.0|#|As an amateur, this camera is very easy to use and photographs look very professional. Swapping between manual and auto is very simple|#|Sometimes the auto focus can take a while and if there is not enough lighting, it occasionally refuses to take a photograph but I am sure I will find a setting that prevents this.
10.0|#|Find it easy to use in all functions|#|None

8.0|#|I love dis camera|#|
9.0|#|EXCELLENT CAMERA, easy to use and gives professional pictures.|#|Did not realise i had to buy memory card in addition.
9.0|#|Great Bundle.  The 550 D is much better value than 600 which has only marginally better features.  The EF-S 18 -135 lense  is great walk about lense|#|18-135 Lense should have better definition but could not afford the 24-105 professional lense at 800 euro
8.0|#|Love the manual focusing as very quick!|#|The auto focusing can sometimes take long and decides not to take the photograph.
10.0|#|bought this for my trip to the states and have no regret took over 2000 pictures. once you use an SLR all other cameras seem useless|#|sometimes depending on lighting the camera takes a while to focus and you can miss your window of capturing a picture, but im sure with more superior lenses its even better.
8.0|#|Très bon objectif, qualité de photo vraiment extra|#|Aucun
8.0|#|The camera is great, very happy!|#|It doesn't come with a memory card which means you can't use it straight away. Also unless you have a good knowledge of real photography, you will need a book to help with fully utilising the camera.
10.0|#|Very good starter SLR camera recommended to beginners.|#|None

9.0|#|The Camera is excellent alrounder|#|Price has decreased a lot since before Xmas
9.0|#|Excellent image quality ,large screen ,lovely compact and light weight body . great ASA range and fantastic quality of images taken at low light . very easy to use for the experienced amateur. great range of options ,very good high definition video images|#|note : requires a good knowledge of  SLR  photography to  maximise performance ,thus not suitable for beginners .
8.0|#|Excellent low light ability, HD video quality, and consitent quality metering in auto mode. Excellent exposure reading in most situations. Great compact pocketable size! And shoots in RAW! Mini HDMI conection good to.|#|Bit slippery in the hand. 10 megapixel sensor will sound a bit mean as the year goes on. Buy it for its size and low light ability which is when most compacts are used i.e indoors and poor lighting situations
8.0|#|All good except bad points below|#|2.no panorama
10.0|#|Excellent camera. Researched for ages. Looking for pocket camera to complement my 7D. Image quality is excellent and RAW is a bonus. Very good manual adjustments and auto is good as well (no RAW in auto). Bought another one for my father !!|#|Zoom is limited compared to some compacts but then I wanted a camera that fits in my pocket with high quality images.
9.0|#||#|The price is a little steep and the flash pop up is slightly annoying but you soon get used to adjusting your finger.
9.0|#|HDR, color accent, size, image quality, sensor size|#|battery life is not very good
8.0|#|Generally intuitive and easy to use. Good picture quality, particularly under poor lighting conditions.|#|Understanding when RAW is available was a little confusing and frustrating.
9.0|#|High Quality Camera which shows in reviews to be little less, if any, from its radically more exprensive big brother, the G12. Compact and easy to carry around. The pictures are beautiful in their colour and really do reflect the reality of the object you are photographing.|#|The most unfortunate point of the camera is that there is very little, if not any, grip on the surfaces of the camera. I am left worrying whether i will drop it or if it will just slip from my hand. In addition to this the grip is compromised by the fact that the flash pops out on the camera where you naturally take hold of the camera to most effectively secure it.  Cases and batteries are not cheap!
9.0|#|Picture quality is excellent, especially in low light. An impressive array of creative options.|#|Position of the flash and the mechanism to activate it. More often than not, the finger is over the position which has the flash. So it is often stopped from coming out when it is enabled, the camera needs to be restarted to make the flash operable again.
10.0|#|Excellent low light capability and high iso without substantial noise.|#|Fixed zoom and focus in the video mode.
9.0|#|Excellent picture quality in its class especially in dim light., Lots of DSLR-like features that can be customized. Basic features easy to handle.|#|Not so easy to handle with big hands. Advanced features require more than basic knowledge, which is quite natural.
8.0|#||#|call me old fashioned but a 'hard copy' manual would have been good
9.0|#|Lightweight and small but sturdy, with well designed, easily accessible controls in all shooting modes, including manual.  The image stabilisation generally copes well with my slightly shaky hands.|#|
10.0|#|A real joy to use for an enthusiast|#|Not weather sealed
8.0|#|Ease you use, Very light and small, One click solution|#|Bad for night photography
8.0|#|Very good images quality|#|Without optical viewfinder
8.0|#|Nice compact camera well build. Excellent images. Easy to use.|#|none
8.0|#||#|Cannot find camera case
9.0|#|Neat, Compact, Solid|#|Can be fooled on auto - flash may not trigger for fill with backlighting
10.0|#|Great camera, love it! It seemed a bit hard to hold originally (I'm left handed) and I had to practice a few different handholds. However, the features, image quality and build quality make up for this.|#|None I've found so far!
9.0|#|Raw images files, very quick and easy to manally adjust exposure if camera is fooled by the scene, nice solid feel to the camera but it could benefit by finger grips on the design to give the camera a more secure grip in the hand|#|The zoom is by far the worst part of this camera. The range is somewhat limited to start off with but the lever that contols the actual zoom actvates too quicly and is very corse and hence it is very difficult to finely adjust the zoom to whatever scene you are trying to photograph
9.0|#|Image quality|#|slightly confusing menu initially
8.0|#|Image quality is good for this size of sensor.|#|Should come with a snug fit case or pouch perhaps, to keep pocket fluff at bay.
9.0|#|JPEG modes (I find RAW is essential for underwater photography which is my specialty). Fairly good ISO sensitivity for poor light shooting.|#|The HD video mode is not full HD (1080) but only 720p. This isn't necessarily made very clear in all the literature. I find it somewhat confusing to have two control dials and never remember which I should be using for different functions, sometimes losing me precious moments for a shot.
9.0|#|being able to take photos in raw and full manual control|#|If the flash has been enabled from your last photo it will pop up the next time you power the camera up. Not a big problem but this is where you are holding the camera.
9.0|#||#|Can get complicated to use the advance functions.
9.0|#|Best compact camera I have ever had. You can take this anywhere, fits neatly in your pocket and picture quality is first rate.|#|
10.0|#|It's a fantastic all rounder. Which is nice to hold. have just used this camera on holiday and it's been a pleasure to use. Didn't do too well in low  light. but that could be because I've not set it properly. But I adore the camera and would buy this model everytime.|#|Not too good with low light settings.
9.0|#|Great camera takes awesome pictures|#|None
8.0|#|Small and easily portable.  Shoots in RAW.|#|None really, obviously not as good as my DSLR but is a much more portable alternative.
10.0|#|The s95 is an awesome piece of kit!!!|#|
9.0|#|Great little camera. Image quality is fantastic for the size. Low light performance the best I have used in a pocket camera. It's quick for a pocket camera too. vibration reduction works great. Stereo sound on the video capture!  screen bright and clear. Reviewing images and zooming nice and fast, as it should be. Good control dials (particularly the front lens-mounted wheel). Best pocketable camera for those who like cameras (Though I'm not getting rid of my D700, it certainly gets less use now...!)|#|Macro could go a bit closer. I don't much like the flash exposure, but canon always seem to me to get that wrong.
9.0|#|Easy to use. Intuitive menu layout. Great Image quality - ability to shoot in RAW makes the world of difference. Like the use and versatility of the lens ring. I experienced the battery life to be better than what I have read on reviews prior to my purchase.|#|It is a little bit more bulky than what I was looking for - however it is a very small price to pay for all the features and image quality it produces.
10.0|#|Absolutely first class camera - easy to use from the moment its picked up - takes great pictures in auto mode - brilliant for capturing those all important 'children on the move won't stay still to say cheese' moments!  Love the pictures and clarity.  All in all a brilliant little camera for the price.|#|The placement of the flash still catches me by surprise - it pops up right where you're holding onto the camera, but i'm sure i'll get used to it soon.
9.0|#|Compact body size; quality and size of display screen; excellent low light performance.|#|None so far.
10.0|#||#|Check if your edition of photoshop will process the RAWs.
9.0|#|very compact, x-small, fits into a pocket easily, good features, excellent image quality for this type of compact camera.|#|weak battery

9.0|#|Manual controls. Very good photos at low light conditions.|#|Many options not available when shooting in RAW format.
8.0|#|excellent images|#|difficult to learn how to use the features
8.0|#|Overall an excellent Camera. Feels more substantial in your hands than a 600D. Excellent screen. Well laid out menu controls.The camera will easily take more than 400 pictures in raw format on a single battery. The 17-85mm kit lense is ok and seems sharpest around 50 mm.|#|To do that you'll need to buy a decent prime lense. When you see the output from that combination, it will put a smile on your face.
9.0|#|It is an excellent camera for the serious hobbyist - the camera feels solidly built, picture quality is very good even under some difficult cinditions, the burst speed for sports shots is impressive!|#|Not so much a bad point but more  a sign of how much a novice I am, it is less than intuitive to find some of the settings and quite often you have to trog through menus to find what it is you wish to adjust. It is expensive and hence not as good value for money as it might have been, particularly with the 600D coming onto the market - I did consider this but prefer the weight and features of the 60D.
9.0|#|A very good camera with a nice feel about it, easy to use and good instruction book|#|
9.0|#|I am used to using a full Pro body( Nikon D2xs and Nikon D3) but I didn't need these any more and made the move to This canon!! Not something I am regretting! Great Camera!|#|It is a plastic body, which while still robust, is not as reassuring as a magnesium body which I am used to. If you want a magnesium alloy body, buy yourself the 7D
10.0|#|series lens on it.  Flip screen has it uses when you need to hold the camera up high to get a shot.  Camera can turn RAW into JPEGs and can fire most canon flashes remotely.|#|
9.0|#|Although its a higher level DSLR than the entry level cameras it doesnt confuse the amateur user but enables you to learn more complex features and produce better pictures.|#|
9.0|#|Great images. Easy to use. I can still use my older Canon lenses which saved me a lot of money.|#|Nothing but I've a lot to learn with this new camera.
8.0|#||#|These are really quite minor issues though, the camera is still an amazing bit of kit, possibly not worth upgrading from a similar or recent model but from a 20D, oh yes, do it, now.
8.0|#|It's my first dSLR and I love it. Everything is fantastic, right down to battery life.|#|Can't decide which lens to get next.

9.0|#|first DSLR so im no expert , but from a compact camera to the 60D my images are just brilliant now , the fun in now looking for things to take photos is getting me out so much more than i thought it ever would , early mornings to late evenings .. just a brilliant bit of kit.|#|18 - 135 mm lens that came with the package ...the zoom lens when tilted down on the neck strap moves out . not an issue BUT it isnt supposed to do this , small problem not anything im worried about .

8.0|#|Good zoom range, generally good image quality|#|At wide angle and extreme zoom settings chromatic abberation is very noticable for about 1/4 of picture width on each side of the picture, and at extreme zoom the right hand side of the image becomes very blurred

8.0|#|Good value|#|Plastic body
10.0|#|Good quality camera with decent lens.  Having had a lower range Canon eos before it was great that there are many similar features and functions in the same way.  The 60D has more features though which is great.  The camera feels nice a solid yet not too heavy and the video is easy to use and the built in sound is susrprising quite good.|#|No real bad points - there are lots of features on this camera and it may take some time to find out about them all!
9.0|#|Easy to use but it also has lots of features which can be grown into as I become more familiar with the camera. Also I can use a macro lens that I previously used with another Canon film camera.|#|

9.0|#|I have achieved good audio by attaching a Zoom H2n via its headphone socket to the 3.5mm mic socket on the camera. By fiddling with the camera's manual gain, and the Zoom H2n's headphone volume, I was able to match the audio meter on the Zoom with that on the camera. This way I can still monitor audio levels while shooting video (using the Zoom), even though the camera won't let you see its audio meter while shooting.|#|3. an xlr input offering phantom power, not just a 3.5mm mic socket
10.0|#|Good balence and body shape. Higher quality at higher ISO values allowing for faster shutter speeds in low light. 18-55mm lens has been improved and has a more solid feel which is better on manual focus setting.|#|Lock on exposure setting control seems unnecessary but not a big problem.
9.0|#|Good image and video quality. Good build quality too for the money.|#|Lens EF-S 18-55mm IS have poor build quality.

9.0|#|Then you move on to Program mode, Av; Tv, etc.!  An absolutely brilliant photo taking machine.  Highly recommended.|#|I spent a lot of time reviewing, trimming and experimenting with Av settings and taking bracketed shots, and soon ran the battery down.  Probably due to the energy requirements of the very large image area that takes up the full height and width of the rear of the camera body.  I will go out and buy a second battery without delay.
10.0|#|big touchscreen, easy to use, great quality photo's as expected from 12mp, better than expected photos in not so bright enviroment, I read up and purchased due to the f 2.0 which is the wide angle ability to allow light into the shot, but you loose a bit of the rear focus ( i.e. you focus on a person and the hills in the distance are not brilliant in focus) but I purchased for the light shot (indoor photo without flash) so is exactly what i wanted, brilliant camera...|#|large flush screen could have done to be slightly recessed to prevent damage while in the case.
9.0|#|Good quality of the pictures.good size,nice shape.worth money.|#|
7.0|#|Small enough to put into your pocket.|#|Difficult to understand the workings of the camera, too much on a very small unit. The CD is only a printout of the written manual, not too impressed with it, but will learn l hope.

9.0|#|Small quality camera for easy photo's and videos, i purchased an extra battery but have not had to use it as battery life good. I have not yet read the manual fully but found the features easy to use and find simply by trying the menu.|#|Only bad point, which is not the camera itself, is that on HD mode the videos only play on my one year old laptop and not on my six year old desktop. I have started to set the video on standard mode as this is still good enough quality for my needs and plays on both machines, also the file size is much reduced and the card can store more photos and videos.

9.0|#|The zoom is fantastic for such a compact camera.I had an ixus previously and wanted a better zoom and pixal. I have got this for a very reasonable price|#|
8.0|#|The lithium battery, as opposed to AA batteries, means that it can be used for a full day without the need to carry spare batteries.|#|Although I normally use my EOS 450D in manual mode, I am still trying to navigate the 115's menu and features - less rarely required and gimmicky features would make the camera more user friendly - so I almost invariably use it in Auto mode.
10.0|#|Very light and compact. Picture quality is very good for a camera this size. Lots of different shot modes and the full auto make it extremely easy to use. The full HD video is excellent. All in all a great camera in a quality well built package as you would expect from Canon.|#|Colours in the video are a bit strong.

9.0|#|There's a lot packed into this neat little camera. It's ready to take pictures almost as soon as the power button is pressed. Exceptionally good in low light situations - you can take photos indoors without the need for flash. The video facility is very easy to use and gives good results.|#|Make sure you've got the wrist strap attached, as the camera is small, shaped like a bar of soap and is just as slippery.
10.0|#|Brought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!!!|#|none
10.0|#|When I brought my first Digital Camera 7 years ago, I always intended to buy a Canon as they look far superior to others on the market. However the salesman talked me into buying a Pentax and although this has served me well and was a good camera, when I decided to buy a new one, I went for the Canon. The features seem endless and the camera is very easy to use. The build and print quality are very good. Would highly recommend. With the Canon cash back offer, it was an absolute steal!|#|The only real bad point is that it doesn't come with a case or memory card, however, due to the cash back offer, this more than covered the purchase of them.

10.0|#|Easy to use straight out of the box; ideal for someone who wants a camera that is simple to use, but with the options of being able to change some of the settings. Can't give a great deal more information as I bought this for a present for someone else but I did take a few test shots with it and the image quality was excellent.|#|I'm an amateur photographer trying to turn semi-pro, so for me there were not enough manual options. That's not the fault of the camera, which is ideal for a beginner.
10.0|#|Amazing range of features- my favourite being the ability to control the camera using your TV's remote when it is connected to it via HDMI. 1080p videos are superb.|#|No case included. Wrist strap poor quality, but that's about it.

8.0|#|It takes excellent pictures for a compact camera, it is very easy to use and has a very large screen on the back which is perfect for taking, and then reviewing, your pictures. While I haven't taken many videos on it, the video quality is superb and you don't need to change the mode from manual/automatic to video as there is a recording button on the back screen, useful for sudden developing videos! Plus, it looks very nice!|#|Taking a picture in motion is difficult when the flash is on as the camera takes a while to focus. Plus, there are not many features at all.

8.0|#|Easy to use and compact - fits nicely into a pocket which is what I wanted.   Haven't had it long but am satisfied that I can use it and that the quality of photos are fine for my use.|#|I really wanted a camera with a view finder - the only problem I have had with this is that I can take photos in full sunlight with the camera at a landscape angle but if I turn it to portrait I CANNOT see what I am taking.   I have got the brightness at the max.
8.0|#|I bought it to replace an ixus 40 which I was very pleased with.  I like the newer features but haven't had it long enough to try everything yet.|#|Do not like the terminal cover which seems very flimsy and likely to break so I use a card reader to transfer photos to my computer.
10.0|#|I purchesed the Cannon SX210 IS to provide an alternative to my SLR and it does that with style. It's compact size gives easy yet professional performance. It is fun to use because the range of features offers the opportunity to shoot in all conditions without having to spend valuable time 'setting up'. Offering the settings choice of 'easy shot' and 'auto' as well as manual really does give this camera a powerfull edge. I love it's descreate size which makes you feel comfortable in crowded places. It's just packed with user friendlineness and photographic features all at a very competative price.|#|None!
9.0|#||#|Despite this, a great camera!
10.0|#|Oh yes - 720p video what more can you want.  My Sony HD Camcorder is getting worried now!!|#|Small niggle re the popup flash being right under the position where I naturally want to put my left index finger when holding the camera.  In reality I'm getting used to this and you can keep your finger down holding the flash back - manual says this is ok.
10.0|#|The 14x is fantastic. Fantastic picture quality. My son doesn't sit still for 10seconds so getting a pictureof him that isn't blurred is a struggle - my Nikon coolpix  was never up to the job (or maybe my photography skills weren't) but this Canon is just perfect on Auto and there's just never a blur. The red-eye reduction feature works a treat - it's not the double flash, it actually has a feature that finds red-eye after the photo is taken and removes it for you in the photo. I'm still getting used to all the features (eg panoramic stitching) so having it work well on Auto is a relief. There's lots of comments on here about the positioning of the flash but you get used to it, and if you have your finger holding it  down by mistake you can easily flick the flash back up manually - not an issue at all.|#|I'm really struggling to find my way around the camera. This is partly due to still after 3 wks of owning it not having had a chance to go through the manual, and partly due to the number of features that lead you off in various directions as you play with them. But really if you're paying this much for a camera you need to invest the time in understanding the more detailed functions so I know I'll get there when I have a moment.
10.0|#|Can be used in manual or automatic.|#|Flash pops up atomatically every time you switch on.
10.0|#|Simple point and shoot with a degree of flexibility for creativity. Fantastic zoom yet still retaining adequate quality at max zoom. Bought as a back up to my DSLR's but seems to be supplanting them.|#|Minor niggle - have to view through rear screen - no visual viewfinder which can be difficult in certain circumstances.
10.0|#|Its extremely easy to use, all functions are easy to follow, its just so easy to get to know your camera, it has a few extra functions that my XS200 dos'nt have  which makes going from framed pictures to moving pictures without having to change.|#|On and off button a bit to small or in the wrong place, if you have long nails or big fingers its a bit of a struggle to turn it on, but thats all.
9.0|#|Point and shoot! Good image quality.|#|Also, the camera does not feel very ergonomically comfortabe to hold.
10.0|#|I LOVE IT!|#|Dial to select scene option is irritating as very bulky - the options could have been done using a menu option

9.0|#|Just slips into your pocket so you can take it anywhere........surprising performance and easy to use|#|Great zoom but wide angle is limited
10.0|#|Superb pictures.  The people at Canon really made this to be a great camera.|#|A bit narrow to be held easily, and it's too easy to accidentally disable the flash by bumping it.
9.0|#|The image quality is fantastic! The pictures take every little detail of the object you are taking a photo of. Even when you use the video part of the camera, it still keeps the same high level of quality. The zoom is absolutely fantastic as well! Could not believe that I could still take such a sharp picture of an object so far in the distance. Also, I love the feature that automatically takes a picture of you when you smile! Absolutely fab.|#|I can understand what people are saying about the flash on the camera, however it's so easy to adjust to! The flash doesn't have to be up all the time, obviously unless it is needed.
10.0|#|Very good value for money.|#|There isn't any really - the only thing is possibly - if you plan to take a few videos carry a spare battery as that really drains the battery.
8.0|#|This is an easy to use camera which gives good results in even quite poor light.  Excellent focusing system.|#|Although the screen is large, the image does not fill the screen so it might as well be smaller (I ordered it for the bigger screen!)  I also feel that this camera needs a viewfinder - used in bright light, it's quite difficult to see the screen.
9.0|#|Just about all of it. I love that it turns on and it ready to take pictures really quickly. You do have to take time to learn it, but that is not a bad thing as there are so many features. However, it functions really well as a point and shoot too so you really get the best of all worlds. Also, I have had mine for a while, taken loads of photos and videos, done loads of playback and still on the first charge of the battery. All good!|#|Only learning to move your finger off the flash when you turn it on, and really that is not difficult to do.
9.0|#|Great as a day to day camera for concerts etc|#|Flash is located in top left hand corner which can be annoying as this is normally where i hold the camera
10.0|#|It is very easy to use and has so many features that make it seem like a 'big' camera but this fits easily in a handbag or pocket.  I love it the more I use it.|#|ummmmm.....................can't think of any yet!
9.0|#|Solid built Canon product with easy use, excellent features as per other Canon cameras. I also own and use two Canon non digital SLRs|#|On/off button small and awkward to operate for big hands. Takes some time to get used to holding the camera without covering the flash when switching on.
10.0|#|Amazing zoom quality and  many features that make taking great photos easy.|#|The pop up flash takes some getting used to as it is just where you want to hold the camera.

Ease of carrying, I am used to the weight of an SLR Canon, 450D, so this new toy is far more convenient, and less heavy, in use.|#|None really, getting used to a new way of holding the camera was a problem but I am coping quite well and the results are more than acceptable.
9.0|#|compact, loads of features (still yet to find them all), very easy to use and great zoom!|#|Flash a little annoying when turn on, finger stops it opening. But I knew this when I bought it, just takes getting used to.
8.0|#|Exelent manual functions which are very easy to navigate. I like that when you change the settings manually, that you can see the adjustment as you look through the screen. The camera does not have a view finder so you use the display screen as a view finder which is great as it gives you more freedom when taking photos. It is a nice size camera and feels sturdy, the image quality is excellent aswell as having excellent quality video. I have to say im a happy snapper with this one :)|#|The zoom button is a bit fiddly and the flash is in a bit of an inconvienient place but to be honest the good points far outweigh these small bad points
9.0|#|Durable and attractive with many excellent features. Love the way when you view images the screen changes from landscape and portrait.|#|Loading software for a camera is a bit of a nuisance!!
10.0|#|i am a novice at taking photos, but even my photos look good. the picture quality is fantastic and i and playing around with it rying different things and enjoying myself|#|the bad points are the flash. every time i turn the camra on i leave my finger on the flash and it dosent pop up. i know i should not put my finger there but its when im holding the camra with my left hand and turning it on with my right it happens. and only with this camra.
10.0|#|various lenses.|#|I find menus somewhat confusin,but I suppose I`ll get used to them..As all previous reviews I`ve read,the flash is poorly positioned
7.0|#|easy to get started, zoom does what it says, pictures are good.|#|Camera is not easy to hold, or get a grip on, its very slim, shiny and slippery! The on/off bottom is so small it needs a fingernail to 'touch' it on/off and hard to find by touch; also the shoot button is not so easy to find by touch. Camera good for young, nimble fingers, but not having those any more I would have preferred a camera that was more sturdy to hold when shooting, and buttons more clearly defined.
9.0|#|Amamzing photo|#|I'd perfer a better manual or DVD to teach me how to use the camera to its maximum.
8.0|#|Surprisingly powerful optical zoom.  Overall picture quality very good with natural colours.  Contrary to some reviewers, I rather like the pop-up flash as you can be sure it won't flash by mistake if the unit is not allowed to pop up.|#|The Jessops own brand case that came with the bundle is a disaster because of the large velcro pad on it.  The hooks of the velcro embed themselves in the rather silky strap that comes with the camera and has almost destroyed it.  Not a good design and I have had to remove the velcro.
10.0|#|Has the feel of a quality product as soon as you pick it up, but compact enough to carry around in your pocket. It has masses of features, which I am still learning about, but it is as easy or as complicated as you want it to be. It has an automatic setting if you just want to point and shoot, or it has all the manual settings for light, shutter speed etc. plus it has various integral colour filters. Great value little camera.|#|None, that I have found.
8.0|#|white function but hey, you can't have it all.  It's sometimes too quick for me, so it takes abit of getting used to if you're an amateur like me.  Well worth it though.|#|w function would've been the icing on the cake :o)

10.0|#|there are no gimmicks....it is easy to use. I bought this product as a gift,so the package with the extra battery was extremely useful. Also to add to this package, I want to purchase an underwater housing as the recipient wants to use when diving.|#|I desperately want to buy the underwater housing.....However the advert promoting it implies that the housing is not waterproof!!!  I would appreciate advice please.

10.0|#|The HD video quality is really good u can zoom right in as far as it will go and you don't loose any of the quality.|#|the camera is not very good at night time ( if ur at a concert) if the room is dark with flashing lights. Just doesn't focus very well
8.0|#||#|Disappointed that no instruction manual was provided in ENGLISH yet instruction manuals provided in Finnish, Swedish, Danish. The camera came with a 3 pin UK style plug so why no instructions in ENGLISH. It is a menace to have to refer to the English version online instead of having a handy booklet.
8.0|#|Provides detail on screen for the different shooting modes so you don't need to keep referring to the manual. Well worth using these to get the advantage of the setting in differing conditions.|#|The manual could be better quality printing and paper for a digital camera in this price range and quality.

I think the camera is somewhat overpriced for what it offers.  Compared to the SX120 IS, the SX210 IS is sadly lacking and I would not recommend this particular camera.  The SX120 IS is a far better camera and exceptionally good value for money.
10.0|#|Bought it for my mum - she is not very good with cameras. But this one was easy to use, with good quality pictures and video - everything she needed. Plus, the screen is bright and big!|#|The flash is definitely in the wrong place. You want to put your finger there when you hold the camera.

The life of the battery is quite good. But i bought an extra one in any case. There is so many good things about this camera. You have to try it. I recommend to everyone who enjoying amateur and home photography.|#|I didn't find any and i hope i wont.

9.0|#|Very impressive features and size for a 14x zoom camera. Ideal if you want to go out without too much stuff, just put it your pocket! With a camera this good, you don't need a DSLR unless you're a pro really. I'm still finding features I didn't realise it had.|#|The hand strap seems very prone to snagging on the velcro parts of my Lowepro pouch. Even after a couple of snags it's not looking like it will keep its form for long and it's quite difficult to pull it off the velcro without causing any damage. But it's only a strap!

9.0|#|Good quality images for a compact camera. Once you get the settings right you can happily use it on full auto, semi auto or manual. Built in flash is suitable for most uses. Lens goes from fairly wide to super zoom (~28mm-400mm in 35mm terms). Overall this is a suitable replacement for my DSLR when a SLR is too big to carry.|#|Anything above 400 ISO is pretty unusable. Manual settings are tricky, and manual flash power setting requires going into a menu - I've found myself using one of the auto scene modes for dark environments like bars and clubs. No 2-second review in anything but auto mode!! Flash pops up right under where your left index finger naturally sits.

8.0|#|My 'main' camera is a Pentax K-m DSLR, but I often find it too bulky to lug about, which is why I wanted a good quality compact to go with it. I was attracted to the SX210 IS by the long lens and good reviews, so I took the plunge. I never use the 'auto ISO' setting, as higher ISOs always have too much of a negative effect on picture quality. Set to ISO 80, the picture quality is so good in good light, that it is almost on a par with my Pentax. Considering the sensor on the Pentax is around 13 times bigger than on the Canon, this is a quite astonishing result and significantly better than any other compact with a similar size sensor that I have ever owned. I have always found the 'in camera special effects' to be a waste of time in the past, but several on the SX210 IS are genuinely good and combined with that long telephoto lens, really makes we want to get out and find things to photograph in a way I haven't felt for a while now, which is great.|#|Now the negatives, the biggest of which by far is the video quality, which is so poor as to be almost shockingly bad. Maybe it's the bad, dull weather recently forcing the camera to select a high ISO (you can't set it manually in video mode) but I've checked it over and over again to make sure it is actually on the HD setting (it is). Colours are dull and lifeless, detail is simply non existent and both focus and exposure are all over the place: unless you or your subject are static, the focus spends longer than it should 'hunting' and auto exposure is set way too high, so everything looks over-bright and washed out. HD video was certainly not the main reason I bought this camera, but it was one of the influencing factors and the fact that it is all but unusable is very disappointing. Battery power: I've taken around 160 shots so far (mostly photos + a few short videos) and the battery is now reading low - sometimes capacity increases after a few charge cycles and I can only hope that will happen here, as 160 shots is really not good. Awkward to hold: I may just need to get more used to it, but the sleek design, big screen and pop up flash position doesn't leave much to comfortably hold on to.

8.0|#|Simple to use.   The automatic lens cover is a great feature as it means no separate cap to keep hold of.   The Panorama featuere is also very easy to use and very effective.|#|The camera takes a couple of seconds to confirm its auto-focus, so if you are too 'snap-happy' you can get some blurred pictures.
10.0|#|the photographs taken on auto are fantastic. Very few red eye photos and the quality of the prints from the camera is great. I havent had time to read any of the book so just put it to auto and point and shoot - took fantastic photos of our daughter's wedding. Would thoroughly recommend it. I have always used Canon Ixus cameras and still have an Ixus 915 which is a great wee camera and I was worried about this one being a lot bulkier. It is not a problem and the quality of the photos make any difference in size irrelevant.|#|None that I have discovered so far

8.0|#|Excellent features in a compact digital camera. The powerful 14X optical zoom is rivaless in this class of cameras. The disign is also very attractive. Probably the best compact digital camera for this price range.|#|Although this camera features a big LCD display, the entirety of this big screen is not utilised the playback stills. The flash pops up when you power up the camera regardless of the ambient light level. The body of the camera looks very plasticy. This sort of minimizes the capability of such powerful camera.

More likely to run out of battery power before running out of image capability.|#|The pop up flash is a bit of a pain - its position means you are forever preventing it opening by leaving your finger over it. The build quality is good - but it isnt stylish and a bit of a lumpy piece of kit when compared to similar and equally capable cameras. Shame its only available in black as the look of it would be enhanced if it were available in silver.

9.0|#|Small, well made and an excellent backup to a DSLR. On the basis that the best camera is the one you have with you, this is one that can easily fit into a shirt pocket or handbag, and for a compact, it takes excellent pictures. The ring around the lens is a real benefit for changing aperture, ISO etc. Intuitive and very easy to set up.|#|Manual is on disk. I downloaded one from the Canon website and printed it out. It is just over 231 pages so two ring binders will be needed. Possibly too many options for my use.

9.0|#|Picture quality excellent for a compact camera.  I especially like the night time function which allows you to get a clear picture without a tripod as it takes multiple shots.  I'm not very clued up on all the different functions but after playing around with it whilst on my honeymoon I've worked out quite a bit and got some really high quality pictures in different settings.|#|The flash pops up from the top left and as I usually hold the camera there i nearly always have to retake the picture or if getting someone else to take a picture of you - I guarantee they too will hold it down.

9.0|#|I read a lot of reviews about this camera and every one said how good the picture quality is. My previous camera - Nikon Coolpix P100 - the colour quality was very poor. I am delighted at the colour quality of this camera. I am still finding my way about the menu's, but so far I am impressed.|#|Pop up flash just where you tend to hold the camera. No manual flash control when in Auto - only Auto. I tend to use the flash when there is backlight, such as when taking a portrait against strong light. I'm sure, once I get used to the settings I will find a way round this.

10.0|#|Viewfinder - 2.7 inch LCD screen - general handling i.e. easy to get a good grip; the raised area on the front is ideally shaped for you to lock your index finger on.   This also acts as an anchor and helps keep the camera steady.|#|Only one - zoom limitations.   It is difficult to judge the amount of zoom to create the perfect composition.   I am guessing practice makes perfect!
9.0|#|The picture quality is good too.|#|
8.0|#|Easy to use and user friendly|#|The number of shots i was told the battery could take wasnt what it turned out to be. Took less than 45shots within a week,and the battery went flat
9.0|#||#|The basic controls are in a Getting Started booklet, but the User Guide is on CD which I don't find very useful, although the on screen text compensates.  This is my third Powershot and the previous ones managed a User Guide booklet.
7.0|#|I bought this as a handy compact camera that would supplement my more expensive, and larger, cameras. As it is, I believe, the only compact camera with an optical viewfinder in current production, this was the only choice I had. Being of a certain age, I find using cameras with only a display screen a great nuisance. Get reading glasses out every time you want to take a picture is hopeless. The Canon is light, simple to use and produces acceptable results.|#|The pictures do not compare with a 400 pound camera obviously and it is not as slim as some other compacts, but overall a good chioce for a point and shoot pocket camera with an optical viewfinder.
9.0|#|Really is a point-and-shoot camera in easy mode.  Macro pics are well-focussed and look really professional. Liked the structure of user manual i.e. the basic easy stuff in a small instruction book, plus the more complicated info. on disc.  That way you don't have to search through reams of text for the answer to a simple query.|#|The batteries don't last long at all if you take lots of shots.  ALWAYS have some spares with you ...
10.0|#|Lots of good features and found it easy to use. Images like all Canons are top notch.|#|I don't think this camera has any bad points.
10.0|#|Excellent quality pictures from uch a cheap camera. Has a usable view finder when needed. Very easy to use menu system. Uses standard AA or AA rechargeable batteries. Video quality is outstanding.|#|Optical zoom not available once you are in video mode.
10.0|#|Nice compact camera with the advantage of having a view finder for looking through as well as the screen. this is very convenient when the sun is shining brightly and makes it very difficult to actually see anything on the screen.|#|None found as yet.
10.0|#|Bought for my wife who just loves it.|#|The battery/card department not always easy to open.
10.0|#|4) Great price|#|Non really....
9.0|#|Having used a compact with only a screen which was useless in bright light, I looked for one with a viewfinder. This one does not dissapoint. Although quite small, the viewfinder is all that's necessary, so much so that I only use it instead of the screen.   The main purpose of having a canera is to take pictures and this one takes good ones. The sharpness and colour are as good as I have seen. The quality of movies puts some camcorders to shame. The movie capacity depends on the memory card. There are more features on the camera than I am likely to use, but the layout makes selection easy. The main control wheel is positioned so you are unlikely to move it accidentally while in your pocket (or handbag) The A1200 ticks most of the boxes for a compact. For me, the decider was the viewfinder.|#|The instruction booklet is just a 'getting started' guide. The main instructions are on the disc. If like me you are not too hot on computers, you will struggle to find what you want. Then when you are out taking pictures, you will think 'what did it say'?
9.0|#|very useful view finder, my elderly mother finds it alot easier to use as had trouble with traditional digital cameras.|#|view finder quite small takes time to get used to
10.0|#|The view finder is invaluable in very bright conditions and I like the use of AA batteries (which you can pick up almost anywhere in the world). Good quality photos and very easy to use. Excellent camera.|#|Card and battery compartment a little 'fiddly' to open (especially if trying to change them in a hurry).
10.0|#|Viewfinder invaluable for bright sunny conditions, (doesn't happen often in UK), but great for foreign holidays when I take 90% of my photos anyway.  Have been a fan of Canon for years and have several Powershot SLR's (still all in working order). Love the date displays and versatility of A1200.  EXCELLENT.|#|Can't think of any off-hand.
5.0|#|Viewfinder, nice design, simple layout, solid buttons and switches, takes AA batteries, brand name reputation.|#|but nevertheless is something to watch out for. As such my review can only be based on my experience of two identical models - if picture quality was as expected I would have given the camera a high rating.
9.0|#|Fantastic point and shoot Camera with excellent results|#|None,  Canon got this one spot on
9.0|#|Viewfinder incorporated. Uses AA batteries.|#|User manual in CD format. Would prefer booklet included.
8.0|#|The camera is quite rugged, simple to use and the great thing is it runs on ordinary AA batteries.|#|Like all the point and shoot digital cameras I've used it is a bit too slow. Taking shots of anything that's moving is a bit hit and miss due to the shutter delay. Guess that's one of the reasons people buy expensive cameras though.
9.0|#|Very easy to use in auto mode and has user modes when more creativity and control is desired.|#|Use of standard AA batteries is disappointing since they deplete rather quickly. We are now using rechargeable AA's.
8.0|#|Compact and easy to handle.  Viewfinder as well as screen is useful.|#|Instructions for use a little confusing.
10.0|#|As a retired person the most important feature is the eye viewfinder.This is a very important feature for my peer group and since my acquistion a number of my friends have indicated an interest in purchasing this model solely because of htis feature.|#|
10.0|#|It's very easy to use and takes care of all the technical stuff itself, just as I want it.  It's really nice to hold, and a brilliant camera at a great price.|#|I haven't found any yet.

9.0|#|Very pleased with the product|#|None so far
9.0|#|A nice easy to use pocket camera with a viewfinder, so the screen can be switched off to save the batteries (I use re-chargeables).  Can usually get good results with Program mode.  Not as well made as some, but doesn't feel as though it will break with normal use.  Battery life is quite good and it uses standard AA batteries.|#|Plastic tripod socket.  Some of the effects such as 'Toy Camera' are not very useful.  No case with it but it fits in your shirt pocket so you don't need one.
9.0|#|Lightweight, has a viewfinder for difficult light conditions, has good wide angle - better than older models|#|None at this price and size.
9.0|#|An excellent starter option, and a good cheap camera small enough to carry around at all times for pictures of opportunity ( the pictures are good enough, losing or wrecking it are only a small disaster).|#|small range of settings, unless you know how to program it.
8.0|#|The optical viewfinder is indspensable forshooting in bright sunshine, despite a good screen image.  The use of readily available AA batteries avoids the dependance on a power supply when traveling in remote areas.  Both features, which I consider essential, are not offered by many manufacturers.|#|None spring readily to mind!
8.0|#|The camera is very easy to use, with quite a few interesting features (although I prefer to use the auto-setting). The viewfinder is also useful and I chose this camera partly because it's one of the few to use AA batteries.|#|It's a bit bulky but that's the price to be paid for using AA batteries. There's probably some technogical reason for it, but if this camera could operate on AAA battries, it would be better.
9.0|#|the canon a1200 has an optical viewfinder which is very rare on a compact camera so is excellent in strong sunlight|#|it uses AA batteries which tend to make it comparatively heavy
9.0|#|This camera has a viewfinder, which most point-and-shoot digital cameras lack. It makes a world of difference to what can be done in bright sunlight, when the screen is virtually useless.|#|None of any consequence. This is a very good camera in its price range, and I would recommend it without hesitation.
10.0|#|Rotary dial for selection of mode, unlike the IXUS 75 where the slide switch could be moved when inserting or reving from the carry case. Theviewinder is a good feature, especially in that the optical zoom view is provided.|#|The viewfinder is rather small and can be difficult to locate when you are in a rush to take the picture. Also the field of view through the viewfinder is less than what is actually taken on the photo. This can be  annoyoing at times as a better picture would have resulted from the greater accuracy of the viewfinder, although obviuosly extraneous material can be edited out later.
10.0|#|Light and very compact so easy to slip into a pocket or handbag. Takes very good pictures and downloads quickly.|#|
8.0|#|It has a view finder, which is a boon to anyone having to wear glasses, who wants to take a quick snap.|#|AA batteries make it a bit more cumbersome than it need be

8.0|#|Very easy to use.|#|The reason I bought this is because I wanted a compact camera with an optical viewer. This is the only compact that has this feature I believe. It is useless and just shows that same image whether you are zooming or not. It also doesn't show any information - in fact it seems to be just a superficial extra that didn't actually DO anything. This is the only part of the camera that was a dissapointment.
10.0|#|Cracking little camera that has exactly what I wanted.  It has a simple setting which guides you through how to use it as you learn all about the new toy.  Not too costly, lovely picture quality.  I read that it had a cheap plastic bulky body - completely disagree, yes it's plastic but it's a good buy.  Completely understand why it was a which top product.|#|

9.0|#|Great features and flexibility; very good image quality for the price; has a viewfinder too (regard this as vital in some lighting conditions).|#|Quite heavy on batteries; using alkaline AAs now since didn't find NiMH batteries lasting without camera complaining. Like many other cameras now, no doubt the plastic catch on the battery compartment will be a weak point ...
7.0|#|No 1 priority for me - has a viewfinder.  Small, fits in a pocket/handbag.  Takes good pictures in ideal conditions - light and preferably outdoors.  AA batteries so easy to carry spares and don't need power source to recharge.  nice little camera for 'snaps' but a bit disappointing for anything more complex.  Next camera with viewfinder is much more expensive and complicated.|#|Low light setting did not compensate for low light conditions. Not much difference between different settings and auto. Pictures not as good as my very old 3m pixel camera.
9.0|#|Nice compact camera wih good features. Very good image quality. Helpful to have the viewfinder but quite small. Good fun playing around with the different settings i.e monochrome, fish eye lens etc. Haven't used the video yet so can't comment on that aspect.|#|Does feel quite plastic-ey and the battery compartment is quite difficult to close sometimes - quite easy to turn it on whilst doing this! It does feel like it (the battery door) could break very easily, wish this part was more substantial.
9.0|#|Close to the 'ideal' digital point-and-shoot for most users. I use the camera as a back-up to my Canon 450D.|#|None really. Lens could have a few lines of resolution more, but adequat for the price.
10.0|#|Easy to use|#|

9.0|#|Optical viewfinder! Very rare on a camera of this price, but it means you can take pics in sunlight when others are struggling and squinting at screens! Well done Canon. Perfect and pocketable. Love it.|#|Not a lot! It's cheap and cheerful and you get a fine little camera for your money.
8.0|#|Not too expensive, compact and light. Moulded slightly so it can be held securely when taking shots.|#|Would be better if the shutter button was on the outside of the mode button.

You can't go wrong.|#|Would have been nice to have had a case with it, but this is a minor problem as they are easier enough and cheaper enough to purchase.
9.0|#|Very good macro facility, excellent quality sharp close ups of insects etc.  Lightweight, small, packed with features. Autofocus is quick and accurate. Amazing value|#|Runs on 2AA batteries which can run down quickly, particulary if using flash - would recommend 2 sets of rechargables and keep a spare set with the camera
9.0|#|. Though not my main camera it means I can always have a camera with me. Quality is good enough for most purposes as long as I don't want very large prints.|#|Care must be taken in poor light as focussing can be slow in these conditions.

9.0|#|I bought it for my 11 year old, but wished I'd had one on a recent trip as lugging the DSLR around was a pain at times! And where I would have need a £300 telephoto lens on the DSLR this camera was able to zoom in and focus sharply.|#|Like most cameras in its class that take AA batteries it hasn't been designed to run on rechargeable ones. That doesn't mean it won't run on rechargeables, but it does show a low battery indicator from an early (if not initial) stage and when it finally refuses to work with the batteries you'll find that their charge is only part spent, so unless you have a smart charger that discharges them before charging them you'll be shorting their life. (I'm talking about NiCad and NiMH batteries; Lithium's may be better.)
9.0|#|This is a canon an d like all canons it has a glass lens which gives sharp pictures. It is very compact and pocketable. Very easy to use. I would describe this as an excellent beginners camera. It has an opticle viewfinder which is usually only available on expensive SLR/Bridge cameras.|#|The functionality is basic compared to more up to date cameras.
10.0|#|Has optical viewfinder (useful for someone like me who needs glasses to see a camera screen). Takes pictures nearly as good as my digital SLR camera.  Extremely cheap for a top quality camera. Without it's case, it easily fits my pockets.|#|Battery life is low but I have bought some rechargeable 2500mAh batteries and the problem appears solved.

10.0|#|Easy to use, a viewfinder for those bright days|#|
9.0|#|Lens, build quality and features are good for the price. And it has a viewfinder - one of the main reasons I bought it.|#|The viewfinder could be more accurate - only covers about 70% of the picture.
9.0|#|Viewfinder. I only use the display when necessary and use lithium batteries, they seem to last for ever. Using the viewfinder also makes it a lot easier to steady the camera. Size makes it an excellent pocket camera, I keep it in a sock type case and take it everywhere.|#|

9.0|#|Easy to use, compact size for pocket.|#|Did not include memory card, but then, people can choose exactly which they want.
8.0|#|The view finder.  I wanted a digital camera with viewfinder, not many available at reasonable price.  This one does the job.|#|Fiddly access to batteries, memory card and download connection.
9.0|#|A viewfinder - how many compacts have one? Have just returned from a holiday with a lot of sunshine, The screen was useless, and all 200-odd pictures were taken through the viewfinder. The A1200 is worth the price for that alone. Altogether a nice camera to use, if just a bit slow.|#|The only real criticism is of the viewfinder, but a small one. Being optical, it does not respond when using the zoom!! A bit of imagination helps, though
9.0|#|viewfinder useful, especially in bright light conditions. easy to use straight out of the box. fun special-effects. large monitor.|#|image in viewfinder when zoom used is not the same as appears as the picture, or via the monitor.
9.0|#|I bought it because it had a viewfinder and I could easily take photos in sunny conditions when I could not see the screen and so far am finding the camera excellent!!|#|No bad points discovered yet!

9.0|#|shoot, as used by my wife, works well.|#|Slightly bulkier than a 'normal' pocket digital camera - but still fits in the same case so the difference is not marked.
9.0|#|Very vesatile. The viewfinder is an important feature for us.|#|None so far
8.0|#|viewfinder|#|none so far
8.0|#|Small, lightweight and easy to handle.  I bought this camera because it also had a viewfinder which was essential for me.  I am very pleased with the quality of the photographs and I like the wider angled lens.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|Big bang for the buck. Easy to use. Quality photos.|#|None so far.
10.0|#|I bought this camera because it had an optical viewfinder having only just abandoned film cameras.It is well built small and light and I like the ability to recall your picture on the large clear screen and cancel all the dud shots.The pictures are good and crisp too.The price, considering all the facilities is more than reasonable.|#|I have to say that this is the second 1200 ,the first returned under guarantee because the electronic display went haywire.This did not put me off however.I would have liked a more compact battery system but then perhaps their bulk gives a more solid feel to the instrument.Very little to dislike and a lot to like.
7.0|#|Viewfinder|#|Zoom ratio slightly low.
7.0|#|when you look through the optical viewfinder you can see the end of the lens, has no effect on the picture but it is off-putting|#|
1.0|#|None. The lens failed.|#|Everything is marked with the lowest score. For example, the camera may have warranted a 7 for Ease Of Use for the short time it worked, but ultimately, I couldn't use it at all. I would have scored Overall Rating as zero but that isn't an option. This was my third Canon Powershot but the first to fail.

10.0|#|Really nice little point and shoot camera. I bought it because it has a view finder as well as the display screen as I sometimes find it difficult to see the image on the screen (e.g. in bright / dark conditions).  Have read some reviews saying the battery life is short, but I haven't experienced any problems.|#|
10.0|#|At last a camera you can use properly with a view finder wonderful|#|Non
5.0|#|Seems robust, I`ve alreadt dropped it and it seemed to bounce rather well.  Comes on quickly and closes quickly|#|.  I was expecting something better than my ageing Samsung and I`not sure it really is.  Overall a little dissappointing for a Canon, even a cheap esat to use one

10.0|#|Great photos taken, brilliant quality and good value for money|#|Could have more functions like black and white or maybe you can blur the back or the front of the image
8.0|#|I bought this camera for my wife who can't stand trying to see what her camera was looking at when the sun shines! The viewfinder although small is perfectly adequate for holiday snaps and the picture quality seems fine to me. I had read some reviews which said the quality was not good but it's better than my more expensive Olympus.|#|Not too happy about 'AA' batteries but at least the're cheap and easy to get.
10.0|#|A great pocket-sized back up for (or alternative to) to your SLR.|#|No guide marks in the viewfinder to help correct alignment in close-ups.
10.0|#|the camera is easy to use and has lots of good functions which enable you to take better quality pictures and movies so overall its a really good camera.|#|

8.0|#|bought for elderly relative wanting basic camera with viewfinder, so this was just about the only one that fitted that requirement.  Also, using AA batteries makes it easy for her to buy new ones without having to worry about buying the right ones.  More features than needed so the basic 'set and forget' setting is an excellent idea.|#|On/off and shutter buttons not best placed and the openings for battery/card fiddly for less than perfectly agile fingers.

8.0|#|Optical view finder|#|No case
7.0|#|Bought for taking pictures largely in difficult coastal conditions, the camera is simple to use.  The video is surprisingly good.|#|The camera was bought to replace a brilliant Canon Powershot (with viewfinder) that was stolen.  The viewfinder is its bad point. I regard a viewfinder as essential for the many occassions when the screen cannot be properly seen.  The eyepiece for the viewfinder is too small and it is hard to frame a shot.  It is a pity that Canon has effectively dropped the viewfinder as an essential part of compact cameras.

10.0|#|Excellent features for a camera at this price, and the picture quality is good too. Using standard AA batteries is a bonus as you will not be left stranded. Overall a great point and shoot with extra functions if you want them.|#|Lapse time is slow, but for a camera at this price you need to accept some compromise.
7.0|#|Good quality photos.Compact size. Fair amount of features. Good value online.|#|Unfortunately shutter lag and shutter button needs getting used to if you have had other digital cameras.

8.0|#|It has a view finder!  Viewfinders are hard to get in this type of camera - I therefore bought 2 'A 1200's.|#|None yet
9.0|#|The use of standard AA batteries is brill. I feel relieved from the tyrrany of a specific battery needing a specific charger. This will be an ideal camera for electricity free camping holidays.|#|It doesn't have some of the snazzy colour options - but I don't need them.
7.0|#|A decent camera, at a reasonable price, with a viewfinder - invaluable in bright sunlight.|#|
10.0|#|Optical viewfinder|#|None
9.0|#|Optical viewfinder - AA batteries - single hand operation is easy|#|
10.0|#|nice and compact, easy to use, but also has extra features if you are more knowledgeable. The macro feature is excellent. I used to have a canon A1,many years ago and am looking forward to playing with this more...|#|the zoom is probably the week point, but it is still ok .
7.0|#|Fast start up. Good autofocus. Bright images. Neat styling.|#|Feels flimsy compared to their a480. Battery cover looks like it won't last long.
7.0|#|View finder to help see what you are framing when it is a bright day|#|None found yet- still learning how to use it all
8.0|#|Compact, light-weight and takes great pictures in low light. Impressive zoom and no annoying pop-up flash. Cool colour and smart metal body. Easy to follow menus and clear screen.|#|Battery life could be better and battery quite fiddly to replace. Will definitely need to buy/carry a spare. Cover for USB and mini HDMI sockets feels flimsy. Pricey.
8.0|#||#|No hard copy manual.
9.0|#|I bought this as a camera to take travelling and provide me with first class photos without having endless features that I don't know how to use. The IXUS 230 is excellent in all respects. Small, light and compact, and cuts to the chase by removing a lot of the manual features that the majority of us don't know how to use, without sacrificing picture quality. Would definitely recommend.|#|Cant really think of any.
9.0|#|Easy to take quality photos. Looks good. Feels robust|#|Battery cover a bit flimsy. Menus not as intuitive as others I've used before
9.0|#|Perfect pictures, great colours, great manual options|#|Nil
9.0|#|Superb image quality for a (relatively) cheap compact.  Low light performance is excellent.  Plenty of scene modes and the ability to make some limited manual adjustments if you want to.  Slow motion video is absolutely amazing and the main reason I chose this camera|#|Menu system takes a little getting used to.
9.0|#|The camera is nice, sleek and stylish. I got it in the colour blue and it looks amazing. It takes good quality pictures and its got great camera modes. This is my first personal camera and its pretty decent.|#|You need to a memory card to start taking pictures apart from that I couldn't find any faults with it
10.0|#|Overall a very easy to use camera. We have a digital SLR and wanted a small camera to slip into a pocket. This camera meets our needs exactly.|#|
9.0|#|Really high quality images in low light conditions. Large viewing screen and accurate face recognition. HD video is also really nice too!|#|Auto focus can be a bit inaccurate but only while your getting use to the camera. Also the shutter button and surround is plastic; asthetically metal would have looked and felt better but thats me being picky!
9.0|#|Auto scene selector and facial recognition.|#|Haven't found any yet!
10.0|#|Excellent camera and made a great present for the wife.  She wanted a camare that would take good photos in low light and this works well.|#|Feels a bit 'cheap' with plastic components.  Cheaper Nikon that this was replacing felt better in the hand but did not take pictures of the same quality.
9.0|#|Only had it for a month but what I have seen so far: The many features and functions are surprisingly simple to use. It produces excellent image quality, indoor even 'very good' without flash. The metal casing gives it a robust feeling.|#|As I only had it for a month, I may not have noticed everything but one thing I noticed is that it doesn't give me as good a grip in my hand compared to my previous Canon Powershot A710 IS (that side of the camera is fairly smooth but not 'slippery' though...)
9.0|#|Bought to replace ageing Pentax which which didn't always focus in low light situations, but you couldn't always tell on the tiny screen. This camera focuses sharply every time no matter what the light levels are and the size of the screen gives a very good indication of the photo quality.|#|Sound recording level from video is not all that good, but it was not bought for video use.
9.0|#|just a fabulous point and shoot camera. Absolutely love it and have had some stunning photos of a range of subjects since buying it less than a month ago. Amazing|#|I find the menu really confusing and hard to work out. Hubby hasn't had any problems though, so I think I just need to get used to it.
9.0|#|Small, good image quality, fast, great zoom for such a small camera, great price.  As this model is now not the newest, you don't pay for the unnecessary gimmicks such as 16MP and wi-fi that newer ones have, but you still get a great camera.  A significant step up from all phone cameras.|#|For the serious photographer this doesn't measure up to an SLR or bridge camera, but for its size and price you'll struggle to beat it.
10.0|#|Fabulous camera, very easy to use and small enough for your pocket.|#|
10.0|#|Compact, easy to use|#|None
8.0|#|good image quality in low light conditions eg gigs|#|
8.0|#|Small, neat and great images|#|expensive for what you get
9.0|#|This is a great little camera. Compact, light-weight and very handy for popping in your bag or pocket. I upgraded from the IXUS 120 recently, which I took with me anytime I went anywhere interesting. It's perfect as a 'point and shoot' camera, although the 230 HS has plenty of other features. The movie facility is handy for capturing street scenes, events, people etc. Highly recommended.|#|This model is slighly bigger and heavier than my old one, but this is mainly to compensate for the bigger screen.
10.0|#|There have been criticisms of its controls, but they follow the previous Canon style and I don't have any problem with them.|#|It is too early to judge, but I do just wonder if it is really robust enough.
8.0|#|Qual of image massive improvement on what I had before.|#|Takes a long time to find and get used to and use the features.
9.0|#|Solidly built, good image quality, clear large screen|#|Manual / auto switch fiddly to use

10.0|#|A very easy to use small compact camera which is ideal for everyday use. Good images on both prints and video|#|
8.0|#|The picture quality is really good, even compared with a previous canon ixus.  I haven't looked at all the features available as just wanted to take some snaps and it did the job brilliantly.  Very happy with my purchase.|#|
7.0|#|easy to use pretty much intuitive controls.|#|in auto mode outside on a dull day i had to keep putting the flash on manually or photos were almost totally black even with the flash on the photos were not good
10.0|#|Perfect for casual photography, although I have used on some Olympic sporting events and it coped well.|#|Hard to discover/use some of the functions on the manual settings
8.0|#|Reasonable price|#|
10.0|#|Excellent value easy to use.|#|None
9.0|#|The camera itself is also very aesthetically pleasing to look at, and for who want it, the camera is available in a range of colours.|#|Would prefer to charge the battery within the camera rather than having to remove it but gin this is probably just becausey old camera worked in this way. I'll get used to it.
7.0|#|Not had a chance to do very much with it yet - still getting to know my way round the functions.|#|No user manual included.  It takes so much paper and ink to download it all and is bulky to store.  The old little manuals that used to come included with the camera were so useful and so much better.
10.0|#|Bought for a parent who didn't want anything too complicated, no complaints|#|If you are wanting a camera with a lot of manual controls then this is not the camera for you
10.0|#|Easy and portable camera, well worth the money. You can even mute it so you don't get all the annoying sounds!|#|None as yet!

9.0|#|Great Image quality, fast power on time so ready to take photos very quickly, slow motion video for fun shots of bomb diving a pool! good zoom at x8 but with digital zoom too you can get really close to the action without too much depreciation in quality.  Very neat and smart camera.|#|Because of the amount of features available the menu system, which is well thought out, can be quite extensive, if you want it to be - but you can just leave in AUTO mode for easy use. The buttons could be a little more pronounced to make this the perfect little point and shoot camera.
8.0|#|Stylish design, a wealth of functionalities and, most important, quickly ready to take a picture.|#|Compared to my 5 year old IXUS, I don't think the image quality has improved that much. It is good, no question, but I expected more to be honest.
9.0|#|Compact|#|

9.0|#|Compact, lightweight though sturdy quality build, very clear image, reasonably easy to work out the general features .|#|Would have much preferred it to have a small hard copy of the Users Manual rather than having to download a number of A4 size pages which are not so easy to carry around.
9.0|#|Being used by multiple people, needed something easy to use but with good quality .|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use, good compact size that easily fits into the pocket.  Good screen size.  Very good for point and shoot photos if that is the requirement.  Quick to set up and start using.  Battery lasts well.|#|Limited instructions in pack but more available on- line.
9.0|#|So good for such a small camera!|#|None
10.0|#|Very good battery life before recharging needed.|#|Not sure why it does not come with a card or carry bag to protect the rear screen as the cost of these would be minimal if provided with the camera

9.0|#|(I don't know why Canon has discontinued this camera after a short production life because it seems to be better than its replacement.)|#|Not really a bad point but you often need to use Pragram Mode to get the best out of the camera but this is easy to use.

10.0|#|Small and compact. Easy to use as I previously owned a Canon IXUS and many of the features are easy to use, and in some respects they are even easier on the IXUS 230 HS Compact Digital Camera. I tend to use mine for close up, normal and zoomed in images. Good viewing display and larger than on my previous camera.|#|Shutter noise seems louder than on my previous IXUS and the shutter itself is more delicate  (This probably has some relevance to the shutter speed) and is easily moved if touched with finger when the shutter is closed, although quickly moves back to its resting position. I would recommend that the camera is always carried in a camera case as I would not trust the shutter to remain intact if put in a bag without protection.

10.0|#|Awesome camera for its size. Fits into a pocket yet is far superior to many point and clicks. Zoom is just incredible, I am blown a way.|#|Comes without a memory card, so you can't start using the camera until you have one
9.0|#|- Feels solid and well built|#|- Pop-up flash in awkward position, just where you naturally grip the camera
10.0|#|Battery charger does from 100v to 240v so can be used in US and Europe.  Adapter for UK use supplied.|#|It has no internal memory so won't work without a memory card, but not really a bad point, just something to be aware of.

10.0|#|Its easy to use and the zoom is great. Better than carrying an SLR about. Its great for traveling.|#|As with all compacts the taking of photos by looking through the screen is still in my mind not as good as a view finder on an SLR but ok.

10.0|#|My goodness, this camera has crazy features that will make all you pictures unique and different every time. However it also has the clarity of a professional photography....so you will be pleased, no doubt. Battery life is so good; couple hours charge will last for days!|#|Nothing I've discovered yet!
9.0|#|Love this camera. It takes really nice pictures as far as I've tested and is really light to hold. Perfect for casual days or evenings out with friends, I haven't had a full chance to to test it out which is why that score isn't higher. When I tried it out in store I couldn't find the features and didn't think it really had any different settings for different lighting situations, aside from the flash. When I got it home though I had a browse around and found out it did, just not quite as many as other cameras, but it's often easier to pick when there aren't so many to choose from.|#|

9.0|#|shoot camera then this wonderful budget camera would fit your needs. Even without flash, the picture quality is especially superb when there's enough sunlight, while lacking a little bit during gloomy days such as Winter. Video quality is also great, although only at close range. Zooming while videoing is available but will make the video quality grainy and blurry, hence is less favourable.|#|- Small buttons for some with bigger fingers.

The G.P.S does work, it located the pictures to within a couple of metres of location although the tracking doesn't seem to follow the actual route taken when displayed on PC.   Maybe I just don't fully understand it yet!   The camera feels solid and well built.  The price I paid was great value, I don't think I would have paid full price.  For me the camera does all I want.|#|Only problem I am having is keeping my fingers out of the way of the pop up flash.  Just got to learn to re-adjust my hold on the camera!
9.0|#|A compact camera which does everything I want it to. It has a brilliant zoom - although a little 'fuzzy' at full zoom. The camera looks good and I found it very easy to get started. I took children having fun and it coped with the movement well. I haven't yet tried the video and there are a lot of other features which I haven't had chance to look at yet!|#|Quite heavy for a small camera.

9.0|#|Takes good quality photos for the type of camera it is. It has an excellent zoom.|#|The flash is in an inconvenient place. It pops up where my finger is to hold the camera. I just have to remember to hold it a different way when I need the flash.
8.0|#|Clear pictures, GPS is good.|#|Zoom good but you have to hold the camera very still, tricky to do.
9.0|#|Excellent still image quality. Movie quality also very good. Anti-shake works well on long zoom. Well built and simple layout of controls. With a good class 10 card, the shot to shot time is reasonably quick. Battery life good. Small enough to carry anywhere, but still big enough to provide decent handling. This is my third Canon in this series.|#|Like almost all cameras of this type, there is no viewfinder - whatever the manufacturers claim, this is a serious problem with strong sunlight behind you.

The only point I will bring up is the picture quality at maximum zoom isn't as clear as I was expecting, I think a tripod might sort this problem out though.
9.0|#|I wanted a bit more than a point and shoot, and also small enough to put in my bag, but big enough I could actually hold it and press the buttons.

10.0|#|STM manual focus is veryyy nice touch also - again much better than expected and the build quality of camera and lens is really nice|#|Autofocus in live view mode isn't great... Regularly struggles if the scene isn't 'simple' and even when it is working - can hunt around for a good two seconds before finding focus - so just stick to using its INSTANT live view autofocus

9.0|#|Light, 5fps, vari angle screen useful for taking photo's from different angles, info on the screen for what each setting does useful for beginners and people who haven't used all the settings on their DSLR, Image quality good and high megapixel means you can crop pictures and still have good resolution. Touch screen functions.|#|18-55mm lens could be better, wich I had paid the extra for the 18-135mm lens.  Using 18-55 mm lens on video setting you can hear the sound of the lens constantly focussing on the recording.
9.0|#|Very easy to use automatic mode, excellent range of features and settings for the more adventurous/experienced types. Whilst the supplied lens is basic it is more than adequate for a starter kit and good value as a bundle, Image stabilization and auto focus are a must for photos. Free kit bag is very useful!|#|No real bad points. Auto focus on the supplied lens too noisy for movie mode (can't wait to get the 40mm STM pancake lens!).
9.0|#|My first DSLR so i'm a novice with it regards to how to use all the functions. There's a lot this camera can do and I don't see the need to change this for a very long time as the features seem to cover everything.|#|Can't see any.

10.0|#|This is really a good product that fulfill my desire on photography and video graphy.|#|I get colour fringing on unedited videos which I played straight from SD Memory card. After I convert the video, there is no colour fringing problem at all. I dont know weather it is a bad point or not but just wanted to mention.
9.0|#|Out of the box this camera takes very good pictures. The touch screen is easy to use once mastered. The wide range of options on the controls should enable an experienced photographer to take great pictures|#|Nothing wrong with the camera to date. The touch screen will need regular cleaning for live view. it is also the main centre for changing settings so it  means the LCD display is generally on. Not sure what effect this will have on battery life in practice
9.0|#|to it|#|Lens autofocus noisy on video (not that I use it)
8.0|#|Suprisingly the touch screen, it thought this would be gimicy but it actually works really well, it lets you navigate though the menus a lot quicker. I was looking at this or the 60d and i made the right choice for me, its so much lighter and with the new Digic5 it has a few extra features and specs that put it on a par. Lets you edit in the camera, has a clever HDR backlight control feature which does all the hardwork for you when taking over/under exposed shots. The battery life lasts all day for a couple of days full use, recomend having a spare though no matter which camera you buy. Gave this camera 8/10 as i'm sure there are better cameras out there for a lot more money, but within its price range you wouldn't go wrong chosing this camera.|#|Nothing stands out as a bad point on this camera that any other wouldn't have.
9.0|#|The video feature is excellent.|#|Unable to use the view finder to take video, which would make framing easier and more accurate in bright sunlight because like all LCDs they can be difficult to see at times, despite maximum light adjustment. LCD OK in less bright sunlight.
9.0|#|An excellent all round camera for the am/pro! It has lots of good features and tells you what they do as you select them, this makes it very user friendly! The flip screen is brilliant for tripod work!|#|Canon said they would send 4 DVDs to help get me started! They sent one and it didn't teach me a thing, it just said what I could learn on their courses! Grrrr! Nice camera though!

Unusually with todays products is that it also comes with a pocket sized complete manual - highly recommended.|#|Only recently bought camera but to date have not found any bad points.
9.0|#|Excellent images may be obtained by simply setting the camera to 'Scene Intelligent Auto'.|#|Face recognition and tracking is only available using 'Live View' with LCD screen and not through viewfinder but this is a minor issue.

10.0|#|I have had two G9s so the G15 is an updated version of what I am used to.  It has a faster lens, which is great, and is excellent for video.  I am pleased the makers still use mainly metal in its construction, so it is more rugged than its rivals.  Also pleased to see Canon returning to a fixed screen, rather than the swivel screen that has limited use and made the camera bulkier.|#|A disadvantage of the fast lens is that it is reluctant to use flash when I want it to, but I will just have to play with the settings.  The box included a CD with a manual, but only in Chinese!  However it is easy enough to find the pdf on the internet.

9.0|#|Good manual (on dvd or download) - did explain the options well.|#|Still expensive. Got mine cheaper as next model just out but it was a stretch
9.0|#|Wonderful quality pics even in low light, provided you set up for the pic properly. Solid build, relatively compact size compared to DSLR camerals.|#|Colour balance in certain artificial light situations could be easier to get right. Sometimes menus not intuitive. No SD card provided.
9.0|#|Among many others, good low light performance. Very close focusing in macro.  Viewfinder useful in bright sunlight. I like that the flash needs manually raising to avoid it operating without being asked.|#|Not had it long enough to find any yet.
10.0|#|Very good value for money.|#|If you want a point and shoot camera don't bother. This can do that but you will miss the opportunity to take control and be creative.

9.0|#|Not too heavy considering it's many facilities and options.  I look forward to using it on holiday instead of hauling my Canon 7D plus lenses.  Eye Level Viewfinder is very useful.|#|The ELV only extends through the optical zoom range.  Initially, I found  the menu complicated ( I'm a slow learner ) but I'm learning. The Auto and P settings are excellent if needed.

10.0|#|This compact is perfect, both for the photographer who only wishes to obtain superb images from the full auto programme and for the advanced photographer who enjoys using the more creative aspects the camera has to offer.|#|None really - happy with the inclusion of the viewfinder in addition to the screen display, but would have preferred a square eyepiece format.
8.0|#|très bon appareil super photos|#|
9.0|#|Gives very good picture quality for a compact camera; Gives control over all settings making it suitable for most situations; Seems to be very well made and robust; very clear screen; optical viewfinder makes it usable in situations where screen cannot be seen.|#|No information in oprtical viewfinder gives this limited value and I haven't used it as much as I expected - perhaps an EVF would be better in the next model.
8.0|#|Great alternative to SLR|#|
9.0|#|Well designed.  I do like to have an optical viewfinder; there are so few compacts fitted with one these days.  This one is goodwhen the sun shines on the screen.|#|I have not yet discovered any
10.0|#|Quality of build, awesome aperture, fast and agile, easy to carry (not the smallest but small enough for travels). quick control for exposure control. You can´t go wrong with this one.|#|don´t know yet but the cover for lens seems pretty thin so carry case would be recommended to protect cover from taking hits.

8.0|#|Solid build|#|5 x zoom against the previous G9 I owned which had 6 x
9.0|#|Small enough to pop in a pocket and take anywhere with good quality build and plenty of features.|#|Pushing it into a tight pocket can accidentally rotate some of the dials on top, so when you pull it out to take a quick shot expecting it to be on  'auto' it may be on portrait, and the exposure compensation on +2 for example.  Not a major issue, but check before you shoot.

9.0|#|Smaller and more pocketable than the G11/G12. The f/1.8 lens is better for low light shots and therefore (for me) the camera is more useful. The autofocus seems faster than the G12. GREAT for close-ups/Macro with amazing 1cm distance from subject. Battery charge life seems to last forever. Great little camera! excellent image quality and great features. Video quality is amazing!|#|Internal flash seems a little weak/underpowered.
9.0|#|easy to use, quality, program,...|#|heavy
9.0|#|Good value for money while provides all the best features needed by an enthusiast photographer. F2.8 Aperture @ 140mm zoom makes a lot of difference|#|Having so many dials and modes takes getting used to before being able to use the camera effectively.
10.0|#|Easy to use..great quality images. I am a commercial photographer and use to use my iphone as my main casual camera but wanted a camera that had images big enough to edit and use without the light being blown out.

Very impressed with lens quality and ease of use. There are many features and it will take sometime to discover its full capabilities. A big plus and the reason for my choice is the HD video and the ability to view through the view finder and also on the screen. Very pleased with my choice.|#|but I suppose some economies needed to be made to keep price down.

10.0|#|I was looking for a DSLR camera for a very long time and after reading all the reviews I decided to buy the Canon EOS1100D, I have taken atleast 3000 Pictures in the last 1 month but I havent explored the Manual focus yet , I am still using the Auto focus which makes life a lot easier so I am not really bothered about the Manual Focus and cant comment on it.When you zoom a nearby object and take a picture in Auto Focus mode in normal day light , the picture quality is simply Mind Blowing...I would definitely recommend this camera over Nikon D3100 ( exactly the same spec as Canon Eos1100D ) as there is an option to atleast use another lens , just in case.Nikon wont take any other Lens...|#|Night shots are good , wont say excellent.
10.0|#|initial lense 18-55m. I've only had the camera for 1 month, so am still finding me feet with it. However, I'm glad I made the purchase.|#|Camera is bulky, however, I knew this when I purchased it! I also felt a little intimidated with all it's buttons etc, however, I brought myself a Dummies Guide to EOS 1100d. Lastly, again this is no fault to the camera directly, however, be warned once you buy a product of this kind you do end up buying 'extras' battery, sd card, which all adds up!

Good shutter speed compared to other cameras and as a beginner cam as well. Battery back up is good.|#|sporty photo shoots can't be done properly with this.

10.0|#|easy to get started. battery life excellent.|#|
9.0|#|Very small but with a full range of controls including manual. Shoots RAW as well as JPEG. The touch screen control is very effective and an excellent build quality. I have owned an S90 for some years and this S110 is a very good upgrade on what was a very good camera anyway that a keen photographer can carry with them anywhere.|#|None from my perspective and the only comment I would make is that if you want simple point and shoot camera, whilst this can do that, there are probably other alternatives on the market more suitable.

Haven't explored many features yet but very happy with the performance so far. Good quality feel and weight to it.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|Light, Video has straight horizons (unlike Go Pro's that suffer from the barrelling effect)|#|2) If you want to embed GPS data into your photos and video then you need to have your smart phone with you and remember to activate the app BEFORE you take your shot which is ridiculous.

9.0|#|A great camera in a little package.|#|Nil
9.0|#|Video Shooting is also very easy, and a very useful feature. If you don't want it, just don't use it, but when you do want it your not loosing time fnding your camcorder.|#|A bit on the expensive side, but considering you are getting video (*.mov format) at 1080p for up to 29.59min max at one shot, its a lot better than carrying around two cameras
9.0|#|very good quality of images when using high iso level (to 1200), easy to hold, all fonctionnality as well as a reflex.|#|Pay attention to full card: i have lost all my pictures because when the card is full, the camera can't read the card and want the user to reformat the card...Just don't full the card!
9.0|#|The sharp and vibrant quality of the image is outstanding. Time frame between pressing the shutter and capturing the shot is almost instantaneous once the lens has focused. Diversity of the camera is excellent in relation to capturing  various media subjects utilising the various types of lens available.|#|Would have expected such an expensive piece of hardware to have at least a soft case for initial protection as well as a small memory card so ot could be used straight out of the box, neither of which were provided
9.0|#|This was my first SLR, and in all honesty, I expected to have to learn the manual before using. But it is so easy to use, you literally can just turn it on and shoot, as it offers settings that enable you to do that. Image quality is sharp and crisp, and it is just an awesome piece of kit. I recommend it to all!|#|Haven't found any
10.0|#|Would recommend it to any one thinking of purchasing a DSLR for the first time.  There are many accesories which can be purchased for thie camera, and I would recommend a half decent zoom lense if you are interested in wildlife shooting.|#|None so far
9.0|#|the kit lense 18-55mm IS is good starting point, you will be looking soon to expand your lense collection (old SLR Canon EF fit is compatible)|#|
10.0|#|a spare LP-E5 battery.|#|Not encountered any yet.
9.0|#|1080P video is superb providing you're not trying to make a movie but then most people, even with a good camcorder, aren't.|#|Video mode picks up lens focus noise and there is no provision for an external microphone.  This can be overcome by investing in a Canon Ultrasonic lens - a costly solution...
9.0|#||#|My canon 300 400 all use CF memory cards for which I own a number of high quality rather expensive CF memory cards.  Now I have to start over again to purchase high quality SDHC/SD memory cards.  The quality of the basic kit lens (18-55mm) is well below the expected quality of a canon lens.  The slower frame rate to achieve HD video.  Lack of an external mike output.
10.0|#|great camera to use a good balance between pro and amateur for settings, you can be creative or let the camera take control.|#|standard lens has some color abaration on edges, can fix in processing

8.0|#|Image quality, but see below.  Image quality in poor light without flash. Comfortable to hold.  Good quality results with JPEG, no need to use RAW.|#|Kit zoom very mediocre quality - have bought cheap 50mm 1.8 lens and results are far superior.
10.0|#|I have never owned a DSLR before but found it easy to pick up the camera and get going without any reading up. Learning by fiddling about with settings is fairly easy. More advanced things require reference to the manual, which is small enough to keep handy. The photos look brilliant, and comparisons with other camera-owners seem to suggest that the 500D has more features for the price than anything else. The light weight of the camera is a bonus when carrying it around all day or shooting single-handed.|#|Some features are not adequately explained on screen (and don't have an obvious effect) so reference must be made to the manual.
10.0|#|great images ~ really sharp with excellent colour reproduction . The camera copes extremely well with wierd lighting too ~ like a shot I took of a lit candelabra. Took a while to get used to the automatic focus override and am still getting to grips with the manual functions but that could be my problem! The camera is comfortable to hold and light to carry ~ another plus factor for me.|#|

10.0|#|Fast and easy to use in preset modes. Once the manual modes are managed very easy to use.|#|1080p HD slow frame rate - OK for landscapes but 720p better for moving objects. Better still buy a Canon dedicated HD video camera
9.0|#|Used to work with Nikon but wanted to experience Canon, good light camera, sensor cleaning and stabilizer are a plus, large lcd screen very handy. A bit confused at the beginning since it is a bit different from Nikon but at the end all quite clear and overall a very good camera.|#|
10.0|#|Excellent Qualit Feel to the camera, more than an entry level DSLR but less daunting and costly than a pro camera.

10.0|#|I am new to digital SLR photography and I was first scared that the camera might be 'too much' for a beginner, but you can just use the full auto mode until you are comfortable with the other modes. The camera also has a 'creative mode', which is similar to full auto but it gives you some more options and it's really intuitive. I am happy with it!|#|I haven't found any so far.

9.0|#|, I am now abe to take advantage of all of the additional features that this type of camer offers. The quality of the pictures taken has now improved dramatically e.g. I can see where the focus point is and so I am not disappointed that the background is in focus but the subjecy isn't on the final image, backgrounds are blurred on portraits when I want them to be.|#|Haven't found any yet.

9.0|#|the size look and weight of the 500D is impressive, this shows its good build quality. 15.5/15.1 mega pixels make it perfect for post production and give you good scope to digital zoom and keep the quality. settings display screen is that out of the 50D 920.000 pixels, would put most TVs to shame. Lens is great for landscapes and group photos, also portraits, indoors also good with its good f stop. IS so worth every penny.|#|cropped sensor, but as are all models in this range so this point should not be a problem, Lens end rotates when focussing, so no fade filter can be used easily, this can all be done easier in post anyway.

9.0|#|Excellent rear screen definition and more rapid/accurate focusing than earlier model (I previously had Canon 20D DSLR). Pictures quality higher (15 megapixel) and HDMI output provides excellent viewing on LCD TV. Shutter quieter than 20D and more rapid multiple shot sequences. Works well with a range of lenses.|#|Not found any yet.

9.0|#|Solid build, great image quality and more functionality than I know what to do with (yet). I'd been using a 350D for a number of years and wondered for a long time whether upgrading would be worth it. The answer is a definite yes.|#|Not found any yet.

10.0|#|its not the first expensive camera that ive had but it is the best|#|on off switch looks a bit flimsy.
10.0|#|I upgraded from a Canon EOS 400D (which I loved) as I have become a lot more proficient with my photography skills. I got to the stage where there were limitations with what my 400D could do for me. I was torn between going for the 500D or this 50D. I wasn't bothered about the videoing capabilities of the 500D so opted for the 50D. I like the sturdy feel and can look forward to getting to grips with the many different features available.|#|As I expected it is heavier and have therefore had to invest in a new sturdier bag to carry it and my equipment over a period of time. I expected this though and do not see it being a problem.

10.0|#|its a canon dslr they are the best|#|there are none
9.0|#|I have just upgraded from a 450d and I can say this 50d is real quality at a bargin price. It just feels right, for shooting horses showjumping it is great with just over 6 fps I never miss a good picture, the 450d just couldn't quite keep up. battery life is great, just shot about 900-1000 frames on first charge (admittedly no flash used). I shot some photos at a wedding yesterday and they've come out great, even with low light in the church, images have come out sharp and clear. All in all its a great camera and I would even recommend it over a 7d if all you need is a still camera, I still don't understand why people want to use a Dslr to shoot video, but then again I'm probably short sighted. I recommend getting some quality glass to go with this beauty, I bought a canon 24-105 L and its ace. By far the best two purchases I have made towards better photography.|#|Had to buy compact flash cards as my 450d used SD's, no big problem though

10.0|#|As good as the original Canon battery. Can't tell the difference except of course the price.|#|None
9.0|#|Build quality is excellent  with a metal body. Image quality is very good with the right lens and is still pretty good at high ISO. Large high resolution screen for image review. Liveview feature. Around 6 fps for sports/wildlife is very useful.  2 Programmable modes is very nice.|#|Lack of movie mode may be a problem for some.
1.0|#||#|My flash not working !!!
9.0|#|Upgraded fro a 350D - it is solid and stable and has excellent quality  - the 15+megapixels make a difference. Lot sof fetauers which serve me well and more!!|#|Not so keen on where the on off switch is - prefer it to be more accessible - but that's the only negative thing I can say so far
10.0|#|excellent product ,  great pictures,|#|no bad points.
10.0|#|Haven't had it for too long, but I'm able to take great pics fairly early on with the kowledge that there is still huge amounts of untapped potential once I get the many features sussed. A well built body that,for me, feels comfortable when I handle it.|#|As yet, I haven't a great deal of negativity to share with you all. I thought it might take a while to get to know all the features and therefore not get any good pics but this is not the case.
9.0|#|Great features and build quality. 15mp!! super clear display screen and fast focusing.|#|Can be a little bit noisey at high ISO, but this is fixable by exposing correctly and is quite easily remedied is Photoshop.

8.0|#|Excellent images, ease of use and and the ergonomics.|#|The on/off switch is awkward to use.
9.0|#|Great feature set but does require user input to get the best out of camera. If you only intend to use it on auto save yourself some money and just buy a good compact.|#|none found to date
10.0|#|70-200mm Canon L USM lens,Brilliant quality images.Would highly recommend.|#|Body material feels like cheap plastic but lightweight.
8.0|#||#|point considering the price and level of this camera. I mean, you can't ask much more from an entry-level dslr.
9.0|#|From the 400D to this the 600D, it has been improved no end. Live view is a very usefull feature for taking pictures over the heads ofd people in a crowd and down to earth level for macro. SD card is also good, over all a great little camera. A very happy customer, so far.|#|Very noisy when the live view turns off, so far this is the only negative point.
9.0|#|Great upgrade from the1000D , Excellent value for £££ .|#|None .
9.0|#|Responsive|#|Film setting awkward to use, but works fine andtakes good quality HD movies
9.0|#|A good bit of kit|#|none i can think off
10.0|#|This camera is so easy to use in conjunction with the manual. Takes fantastic pictures.|#|Absolutely none
8.0|#|If familiar with earlier models such as 350 / 400d you will find the 600d very easy to use.  The display screen is very clear for reviewing images.|#|Difficult to use focus ring on lens when LCD screen is rotated out, could just be something to get used to doing.
8.0|#|Solid build quality and good results|#|A little heavy
9.0|#|Much smaller and lighter than the more pro models and the LCD being able to swivel not only protects the screen from zips when carrying it around the neck but also saves getting into too many different positions to see your shot|#|None
10.0|#|Overall a great camera, this is the third upgrade i have made and the best so far. very easy to use and produces first class pictures.The video option is also very good and again very simple to use.|#|No real bad points other than it can be quite expensive to get quality lenses to go with it.
9.0|#|Pictures are super amazing, of course depends on lens, but i am very happy with what i have done so far.|#|None so far
9.0|#|Easy to get fantastic quality images.  I've just upgraded from a EOS350D and the new larger LCD is a great improvement for reviewing photos (also see bad points..).  The 600D seems to have much better control of focus points.  All in all, well worth the upgrade.|#|isn't quite what I expected and is quite difficult to control focus.  Same applies for the HD movie mode.  Part of me wishes it was a mag/ali case rather than plastic but the price hike to the next model up was just too much.
9.0|#|Overall, very good value for money|#|Only minor issue is the slow frames per sec. Could have done with being a bit quicker but I can live with that the the relatively low price paid.
10.0|#|This camera is a pleasure to use....the Q menu system makes adjusting parameters a doddle|#|Can't think of any just now but I may find something one of these days.....just love the camera to bits
10.0|#|The live view mode, fold out screen, quick controls, professional features|#|Make sure you buy Class 6 or above SDHC cards (doesn't mention it in the manual anywhere; Using Auto-focus in live view mode is difficult - the lense keeps hunting, so switch to manual; Manual focus is a bit tricky when the screen's out wide to the left

7.0|#|Canon take note: Nikon cameras are better made, better spec'd and cheaper - You're playing a dangerous game, and a diminshing market share will be your future!|#|Live view is just about acceptable.
9.0|#|great value, high spec camera body. the moving live view screen is very helpful and very clear images on it|#|the drive mode could be faster-a bit laboured at times. would prefer ISO settings to be at 1/3rd stop increments rarther than the full stop increment.  but these are fairly minor quibbles

All this they don't tell you before you buy!

9.0|#|Another very good update from Canon.  I appreciate the various oicture formats and the arty modes add a bit of fun to a serious piece of kit.|#|None really.
8.0|#|Superb camera for someone looking to improve the picture quality from entry level SLR or bridge/superzoom cameras and wishing to learn along the way. Do not however expect point'n'shoot straight from card picture quality. Experience in working with Photoshop as well as further investment in better lenses is required to appreciate full capability of this small miracle.|#|The Tamron Lens is not well suited to floral/insect macros. It,'s a basic lens more designed for entry level widelife photography but provide good introduction to zoom lens usage.
9.0|#|Tamron takes nice closeups, especially if used with a tripod.|#|Bag is not very good, I bought a different one within days.
9.0|#|It's a fantastic camera and lens deal - great images and very intuitive features/controls|#|If you're going to offer a bundle then make sure the bag comfortably carries both items.... I'll probably end up buying another bag. Not a showstopper but a little more thought about putting a bundle together is needed.
10.0|#|fantastic quality pix and fast enough to keep up with a horse.  Easy to hold and use but then I like Canon products.  Took advice initially from a pro in the States.|#|A bit on the pricey side but I got a good deal online
9.0|#|The EOS 550D is everything your looking form a SLR camera. It sit's really well in the hand and the picture quality is nothing short of the very top quality. With HD video as well as photo's you have everything you need in one place. This is the camera to have and hold....it will also last the test of time.|#|With some many features you have got your work cut out in terms of getting the most out of what this camera can do. The best way forward would be to attend a 3 day course as it's difficult going through the hand book and to be honest we perfer to play than read!!
10.0|#|Everything an excellent product which gives fantastic image quality.  Perfect for amateur motorsport photography which is what it will be mainly used for.|#|None found as yet after six weeks use!
9.0|#|Excellent system  easy to use with well positioned controls. Great variety of systems from simple point and shoot to close control through programs, Great camera for a serious amateur as well a budding phorographer.|#|Difficult to criticise. Metal body would be great and smaller f-stops but then the price also rockets so great value for what it provides.

7.0|#|Menu is clear and, once you have the hang of it, very easy to use.  I have taken some very good (for me!) action photographs and landscapes.  The feel and balance seem just right.|#|The RAW format is not standard on older packages, such as my 5 year old PhotoShop and new Serif Photoplus X4.  MS.net has been corrupted on my PC and so the EOS Utility won't work.  I have to convert from Canon CS2 to DNG.

9.0|#|The camera is easy to use with a good understandable and readable manual provided.  As a novice, this helped me get started.

8.0|#|Only had the camera a few weeks but reults are very good and it is easy to use.   Haven't tried everything yet but looks like it has all the features an enthusiast will need, menus are easy to understand and access.|#|Not the cheapest option around.  Went for the twin lens option but the bag won't hold both of them - so need another one.
9.0|#|Brilliant camera for someone wanting to progress in digital photography. The camera itself gives you so much help and assistance, it makes it nearly impossible to take a bad picture.|#|It feel a little bit plasticky, just a little bit though.
9.0|#|Well suited to keen amateur willing to take the time to learn how to get the best results.|#|shoot user, as fully auto modes do not always give the best results that the camera is capable of.
10.0|#|This is my first canon camera i have purchased last one i had was a sony Dsc-S600 which serverd its purpose, needed to upgrade to a better quality camera as i have young kids and wanted to capture there younger years, my reason of choice for the canon powershot SX220 hs, was the good reviews i read of the canon sx210, the sx220 was a newer model to be relesed so i went for this. Have to say so far very impressed with the quality of pictures it takes, and the 14x optical zoom is amazing, the genral feel of this camera is nice, it has a good build quality for a point and shoot camera its really amazing, as you can take very good pictures in low light condtions without the flash. im no expert on features and settings but have found it very easy to use, really suprised at how userfreindly i have found switching to different modes and how easy it is to use the menu. the HD video is so easy to use and you can easliy use the zoom function while recording with out affecting the quality of the video still learning to use the different setting so can not really say to much on the different setting modes, But so far very impressed.|#|the one thing i would change would be the place of the flash as when turning the camera on i find my finger gets in the way so it doest pop open. but it can be lifted manualy.
9.0|#|Great focussing and produces great, crisp images when shooting potraits.|#|Not too impressed with the loss of 3mp when you activate wide-angle shooting, but 9mp still gives a crisp enough images for photos of friends.
9.0|#|I have owned several earlier models and this corrects the problem of it being very easy to inadvertently move the camera off the auto setting. Great screen, and excellent picture quality. On highest zoom setting a tripod is advisable.|#|
9.0|#|Quality Product|#|As I have only just purchased the camera my only complaint is regarding the instructions only being found on the DVD.  As a new user it is very helpful to have the information readily available without having to open up ones computer.  You can't easily carry a DVD player on holiday, certainly not for the majority of people.  I would have willingly payed more for the approx 206 pages.
10.0|#|As for value for money, it certainly was in my case, as it was on a special offer, being end of range, But if purchased elsewhere, at full RRP it is really more expensive than it should be compared to others with same specifications.|#|.
9.0|#|Terrific zoom, robust build quality, ability to manually adjust settings and good in low light|#|

I have not had time to get to grips with half the features but what I'm particuarly impressed with so far is the incredible zoom range and quality. I also love the continuous shot mode that has allowed me to get some great candid shots of the kids when they refuse to sit still and pose. Movie quality is superb. Battery life seems pretty good too.|#|As mentioned by many others the flash is a bit awkward. It's easy enough to stop it popping up when you turn the camera on, but if it transpires that you actually need it you have to turn off and on again (unless there's something that I haven't figured out yet). Nothing bad enough to outshine the other excellent features.
9.0|#|the price was good for the features advertised.|#|Instruction manual distinctly lacking in info so doubt I am currently getting the best out of the features, all of which I am still trying to find.
9.0|#|Excellent zoom capabiliity for such a small camera|#|Pop up flash irritating
10.0|#|easy to use and great results. I'm very impressed with the video quality - even when taken indoors. Photos taken indoors are excellent and I often don't even need to use the flash. I'm very pleased with the camera. I used it on a 5 day trip away and haven't needed to recharge it yet :D|#|I bought the leather case as I felt the camera needed protection as I tend to carry it in my handbag.
9.0|#|Very versatile camera, automatic and manual modes, excellent optical zoom range to capture most scenes from wide angle to distant|#|Nothing much

10.0|#|great camera for the money|#|flash is in wrong place but it doesnt worry you, just push it down if you dont need it, apart from that minor issue the camera is great
9.0|#|Just another excellent canon camera. Images are very good. The only slight issue is trying to keep the camera still when using the zoom in video mode.|#|
9.0|#|Excellent range of features and quality within a very compact pocket-sized camera.|#|
8.0|#|great image quality, outstanding display..very clear view, loads of new features, amazing zoom -total of 56x including the digital.Very good video quality!|#|you need 5 presses of buttons to delete a photo, sometimes slow when saving however might be due to the memory card.
9.0|#|Zoom lens is excellent!|#|Would prefer a better manual rather than printing out disc from PC.
10.0|#|All good so far. Compact, weighty enough for stabilising shot and doesn't feel like a toy. Great zoom. Great selection of settings, auto smile is fun, when the subject smiles the camera takes the photo! But plenty for the seriously keen photographer. Been looking to replace my old Canon for years but the picture quality was still so good that it was difficult to beat. I am very happy with this as a replacement.|#|None
9.0|#|Picture quality is very good in low light. Very Compact and has most of the functions you would find on SLR cameras. The Screen is sharp and clear.|#|One of the bad points is the location of the flash, this is where you would hold the camera. Also the flash pops up when you turn the camera on.

9.0|#|Super camera in most of all departments - Set the videa feature to HD 1080 and you be amezed with the quality video, even for a total amateur like myself - The zoom is superb and sharp throughout the range.|#|I would echo most of the previously revues, like the silly pop-up flash evry time you power the camera. The worst criticism I found it to be the recording button, far to small and I was experiencing difficulties engaging at the first attempts, with the opposite happening if lightly brushed against it.

8.0|#|Program options|#|I prefer cameras where you can recharge the battery within the camera rather than using separate charger dock. That option means one cable and not chargers and more cables
10.0|#|The best digital camera around at the moment.|#|Some people have mentioned the flash button rising as soon as the camera switches on - yes it does, but so what? - just hold your finger over it.  If that is all wrong, then goe an buy this camera.  You will not be disappointed.

8.0|#|Many of the control features of PowerShot G-series, but a fraction of the price and more compact. Decent sensor.|#|Minor usability issues, e.g. over-sensitive scroll wheel and must restart camera to enable flash once closed. Ideally, RAW shooting would be supported, but I wouldn't expect this in a typical compact!
9.0|#|fast autofocus, continuous autofocus mode whilst shooting moving objects, macro feature, great optical zoom length, auto and manual modes allow full control. General build quality, excellent image quality.|#|Position of flash is where you put your index finger. The small flap that covers the hdmi /mini usb sockets is of poor design and I suggest will fail with repeated use (plastic and tiny lugs that look fragile)
8.0|#|Light, easy to handle and has the features of a DSLR ie can set at AV for good quality shots. Great sized screen, excellent optical zoom  - and its purple!!!|#|Silly pop up flash everytime you switch it on - why?
8.0|#|Great spec, image quality and ability for manual control.|#|flash is built in where you would usually hold the camera, tok a while to understand how to use all the different settings.

I have blog which needs good quality pictures, this camera yhas not failed so far to give me the results which I have demanded of it. Starter and intermediate I would say, a camera you can  grow with as I have had DSLRs before, but I love this camera, and such a good price with the twin lens kit I bought it with. I also love the grey c, so different. I do love my 1100D I couldn't find any reviews anywhere that had anything bad to say about it, so i took the plunge and have no regrets.

Yes it looks a bit cheap but to be honest I dont look for that in a camera I take pictures with a camera not sit it on a shelf and look at it!|#|If I had to be picky I spose the screen is difficult to see in strong light and the protectors are a bit fiddly.

9.0|#|Have used a Canon camera before, so the menus were easy to use.  Good feature list. Easy on batteries.  Excellent screen.  Really easy to pickup and shoot, but lots of options when you want to tweek some of your shoots.|#|The battery cover feels a bit filmsy.  Some small scratches on the screen, but only visible with the camera off.  Then again it is a refurb so didn't expect it to be perfect.
10.0|#|Perfectly sized for pocket or handbag, but  with an excellent screen which is visible even the brightest of sunlight.  Easy to use - it takes minutes to grasp all the functions.|#|Absolutely none!
8.0|#|This is a remarkably compact and functional product.|#|There really aren't any valid criticisms. The manufacturers, canon, have clearly put a lot of thought into the design and functionality of this item.
8.0|#|Very simple to use and does what it says on the tin - takes very, very good photographs.|#|One or two features short of the competition but quality makes up for quantity
9.0|#|The display screen is huge! Which is very handy when you want to get a perfect picture. It's simple to use and small enough to take out on a night out. The quality is great.|#|Like most canons the battery dies without warning, there is no indication of the battery level but the battery life is quite long so not too much of a problem.

9.0|#|I upgraded from an earlier Powershot which I'd had for years. My new A640 does everything I want it to do and more. The best feature for me is it acts like an SLR with the manual focus so you can blur out the background and still have a sharp image in the forground. It's easy to use.|#|Haven't came across any yet

9.0|#|Excellent range of features for a compact camera.  Can run it manually or as automatic as you'd like.  Basically a mini SLR without the bulk!|#|Screen resolution is a little less than expected.  Why do Canon insist on placing a button on the camera for direct printing?  Who does that?  Surely it would have been better used a direct command button for ISO or Shot size.

9.0|#|Nice to hold and easy to use.  Very quick start up.  Easy to use all controls with right thumb, very useful when operating the settings.|#|Find the battery and card cover difficult to open.  I previously had a Canon Powershot A70 which was more accessible.
10.0|#|A very simple to use camera with many useful facilities. It can be used with wide angle and telephoto lens attachments, at extra cost.|#|No serious bad points except it uses different card technology (SD card) which means that if upgrading from an earlier model (eg A75 or A95) the Compact flash card cannot be used.

9.0|#|Large flip screen, high resolution, good 4X zoom, fast shutter response|#|none to date
9.0|#|The camera has some excellent features and general picture quality is superb. The menus are relatively easy to use and the moveable LCD adds to the ease of taking good pictures.|#|Indoor non flash pictures with people still limited in quality, the aperture and shutter speed options aren't immediately obvious to use and play with.
9.0|#|Auto mode is very good and covers most things. Still getting to grips with the other modes. I got a 2GB memory card with it and just take lots of shots at different settings if I want to make sure I get something. Under normal conditions the one taken on AUTO is the best anyway! Swivelling view screen is brilliant, I've used it a lot to take pics from unusual angles like very low down on the ground, leaning over a wall, and so on.|#|It's a bit of a fiddle to change ISO settings, aperture override etc. but gets easier with time. It tends to use the flash too often for my liking, but you can easily turn the flash off. I find I can hold it steady enough to take quite long exposures without blurring.

9.0|#|A brilliant camera with an amazing ready-to-use time, only takes about 3 seconds to be able to take a picture.

9.0|#|overall a great camara, i am a professional photographer, doing wedding portrait and wildlife shoots. my main camara is the canon 5D but this has proven to be a quick and easy to use backup. ideal for shooting when you dont have loads of time to set up loads of equipment. even the flash is an asset.|#|the lens is poor. but ok. in my opinion the first thing to do is get a better lens. ie 28mm to 105mm usm lens. using a good quality lens on this camara gives a professional look to the camara and the pictures.

9.0|#|It is so easy to use and I could use the lenses from my old 35mm eos on this.

I'm new to raw files, it's fantastic for changing the white blance after taking the photo eg - you can change a yellow tinged photo taken indoors to neutral by changing the WB to tungston.|#|There is nothing i don't like about the EOS400D
9.0|#|Easy to handle and light weight for an SLR ,Very good picture quality .|#|Better if it had used AA type batteries- other than that a very good buy.
10.0|#|Excellent image quality when used correctly, good frame capture rate, very easy to use.|#|None really - but it's not a point and shoot, so you do need to know what you're doing to get the best result from it.
8.0|#|In-built flash is very good.|#|Flash unit rattles when stored - disconcerting.
7.0|#|Battery pack and its re-charging|#|Extraction of flash card from its camera seating could be a lot better.
7.0|#|Battery life is excellent.|#|The cheapest decent Canon lens is more than I paid for the camera body. Images have a slightly 'soft' look to them. Lack of live view. The camera defaults to aperture settings that give the theoretical best results without consideration of the exposure time. Consequently, unless you are in good sunlight, using a tripod or have a very large aperture lens you need to pay constant attention to the exposure time to ensure that the images are sharp. This is worst in the pre-defined modes.  It means that for point and shoot results it actually gives inferior results to my Nikon Coolpix 7900 digital compact.  Fine if you really set up every shot properly though.  To be honest I have been a little dissapointed by this as my first foray into DSLRs.
10.0|#|quality of image and ease of use|#|
10.0|#|It's an excellent camera to handle, which is expected from Canon. The image quality is mind blowing! The anti-dust mechanism is an added bonus!|#|I would like to see it weather proofed.
9.0|#|So easy to use and great that it has similarities to my other canons, therefore quite easy to pick up and use first time. Quality and affordability is brilliant. It's a pleasure to play with.|#|None so far!
9.0|#|WAS MY 35mm PENTAX SPF.|#|RIGHT-ANGLE VIEWFINDER AND REMOTE RELEASE WOULD BE A GREAT HELP TO ME BUT THEY ARE FAR TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ME TO JUSTIFY THE SPEND.
9.0|#|If your thinking of entering into the world of digital photography, I would recommend the Canon, the features available on this model, and the image quality are exceptional. The interchangeable lenses are a big advantage, enabling the user to have a basic point and shoot camera, and as confidence grows, experimenting with additional lenses and using various features. As with all Canon products you get what you pay for, and accessories can be costly. In my opinion the quality far outweighs the price.|#|No real bad points. However, if the user is only using a camera for the odd snap shot I feel there are more suitable cameras on the market, for a fraction of the cost. This particular camera needs the user to study the instructions carefully to get the best results. Not the right camera for occasional use. this camera needs to be used regularly for best results.
9.0|#||#|(Though both the above are sumountable when using the advanced settings)
8.0|#|The camera is well balanced and has very good feel.  It is svery straight forward to use from the outset.  Menus are simple to use and the auto focus is rapid.  Battery life is long, though at this price a spare battery ought to be supplied.|#|.  We had an unexpected total system failiure which due to the vageries of the warranty system resulted in a long repair yet having only recently purchased it the body should have been replaced automatically for the sake of peace of mind.

Good size screen on back - can see what you've taken clearly.|#|Too many features - maybe some peopla will use them, but I probably need only a tiny fraction.
10.0|#|The camera is of excellent quality, with many features and makes a beginner photographer take pictures which are like a pro.|#|Sometimes difficult to setup to your current surroundings
8.0|#|I have found that as with most Canon products it is quite easy to use, but still learning all the features. One wery useful feature is the optical adjustment on the eyepiece resolving the problem of reading specs.|#|Although the build quality is quite good I would prefer the body to be of metal.
10.0|#|the camera is light, comfortable to hold and use, the 10 megapixels gives fantastic quality, and the feature are easy to use and understandable.  Excellent camera!|#|None!

10.0|#|Low noise at high sensitivity. Light weight. Compatible with earlier Eos lenses available secondhand. Self-cleaning sensor.

Hydrogen alpha line filtered out along with infra red so insensitive when photographing galaxies.

9.0|#|Compact and light for an SLR; small handgrip; excellent size screen for picture review; varible settings allow user to decide how 'auto' the photo can be: total, partial or not at all!|#|No major issues that I have yet found other than the small handgrip for fellas - perfect for me though!  Would have liked the option of being able to use a slower iso than 100.

10.0|#|Very easy to use in fully automatic mode, but enough capability to turn incrementally manual to get more precise results (or just for fun!)|#|
8.0|#|Great camera; light, intuitive, a great introduction to dSLRs.|#|The Kit-lense is adequate, but you will quickly want to go and buy many replacements. It's not a very slow lense, and the auto-focus is annoyingly poor in the dark.
9.0|#|An excellent SLR with great features and image quality.  If you are reading this to decide which SLR to buy then this  is the one.  You'll be an accomplished photographer before you need anything better.|#|
10.0|#|Good menu's so it is easy to find what your looking for.  Good instruction booklet with good guidence.|#|It gets a little heavy after a while.
9.0|#|GREAT ALL ROUND CAMERA JUST SELECT AUTO, POINT AND SHOOT|#|NONE
10.0|#|Superb picture quality and ease of use|#|It has got a light body, which means its hard to control with heavy lens.
10.0|#|Battery grip is great. Not yet used in anger but will prove very useful when on holiday or expecting to be using a lot of flash. Also gives a bit more substance to the feel of the kit when standard 18-55mm lens is fitted.|#|Standard 18-55mm lens feels a little light and not as robust as I'd like.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality and easy to use.|#|Yet to find any!
10.0|#|The camera is a joy to use and gives excellent results.|#|I am used to seeing the photograph on the monitor and it took some time to get used to only using the see through lens.

9.0|#|Very straightforward automatic modes, plus plenty of other options to explore.  Decent built in flash - takes better pictures indoors than many.|#|Could have a bit better zoom.
8.0|#|When everything goes right, it takes phenonominal photos and the flexibility of DSLRs, particularly when using the RAW file format is excellent.|#|Getting everything right is not as easy as it looks and there are some superb compact digitals on the market now which are almost as good as entry-level digital SLRs and are relatively easy to use.

9.0|#|I Loved the package deal for this product I wanted to upgrade my camera (Small digital) to a decent camera that i could take good sports shots with so having a deal with both a small and a bigger lens was perfect.|#|As you get the battery grip with this package it would have been nice to have had two batteries to go with it rather than have to go and buy a second one.

10.0|#|This is a 'proper' camera, it looks great and it takes great pictures. A bit of a no brainer really!|#|The supplied kit lense is not bad at all but a more experience photographer will notice it's minor flaws, so a body only kit may be the better option and let them choose their own lense.
8.0|#|Easy to use.  Fast response times.|#|Flash is a little sensitive and pops up more than I would expect in daylight conditions
9.0|#|This is a superb camera, simple to use but with every facility a serious amateur photographer would require and an excellent image quality. Its adjustable focus points and precise exposure controls give you all the control you are likely to need.|#|A couple of the controls are in a location where they can be accidentally activated, but I haven't found anything to make me say this is less than a great, versatile camera.

8.0|#|It has an automatic feature so uf you are new to this type of camera you have the option of effectively pointing and pressing to take a picture.|#|The instruction booklet is small , therefore difficult to read. There is also an assumption about the degree of knowledge that one already has as to the variables that can be altered when using the camera.

9.0|#|Ease of use, controls are generally of a good size and have a positive feel.  The grip feels secure in the hand because of the texture of the finish, which makes you confident you aren't going to drop it.   Balance and feel are better than my old T-90.  The displays both outside and through the viewfinder are informative and clear.   Auto-focus is fast and reliable - manual focussing is easy with the supplied screen.  Metering is spot-on.  Colours are well presented, if slightly warm under certain lighting conditions.  The kit lens has a real quality feel to it.  The zoom is silky-smooth and the image-stabilising works very well.|#|The kit lens is a bit slow f4-f5.6.  I'd have liked a faster one, but can't afford it at present.

10.0|#||#|The reality of moving from a high end compact digital camera to full size DSLR means you also have to think about your photography. I used to have a 35mm SLR (OM2 SP) for around 10 years and then moved to compact cameras, then into digital photography with high end compact camera's. These return excellent results for simple snaps largely because of the processing and intelligence in the camera. Buy a DSLR and while it can also do some of these things you are buying it mainly so you have full control. What you don't realise is now you have to work and think to take a great picture. The camera does not compensate for you. Something you don't realise when you switch back into serious photography having left it 15 yrs ago. Not a fault with the camera, but something that we may not think about. Anyway no regrets on purchasing decision.
9.0|#|Its just another great Canon DSLR. A big step up from my EOS D30 bought new in 2000. Great image quality and low noise performance. Excellent colour balance and dynamic is very good too.|#|Awkward On/Off Switch - It is so fiddly
9.0|#|Overall, this kit is superb. Picture Quality is faultless at 200 ISO and below. 10 Megapixels is plenty!    If you can, buy an L Series Lens.|#|No HDMI, Average LCD screen.
9.0|#|Easy to use and takes fab. pictures|#|
9.0|#|Brilliant screen. Much better menus than the 20D and 350D. Live view is a bonus when using on a tripod. Nice weight and balanced when using 17-85IS. Not too heavy with Canon 100-400IS lens. Will be my primary camera from now on.|#|None that I have found yet
9.0|#|Grip and balance. Speed of focus.|#|Power switch  a bit fiddly especially with cold fingers.
8.0|#|Image quality excellent|#|Not so much a bad point but a change from the previous model in terms of formatting the card.
9.0|#|The EOS 40 was replacing my EOS 350D. The camera is very nicely balanced with a much better display screen than that on the 350. The controls are well laid out but with so many setting options the manual needs to be at hand to make changes. The review screen is much bigger and clearer than the 350 but is still  difficult to clearly review in bright sunlight. So far picturers taken with the 17 - 85 have been very good and the image stablising feature has noticeably reduced blured shots. The battery appears to hold its charge much longer, which is good as I haven't yet bought a second battery. I have since purchased a 75 - 300 IS lens and am very pleased with action shots taken with this lens. Overall I am well pleased with the Camera and would definately recommend it to others.|#|None really, possibly the review screen could be brighter. My wife's Canon IXUS 860 screen is brighter and the picture rotates too when turned from horizontal to vertical. This is not a real critism of the camera which I am more than pleased with.
9.0|#|The 40D is very easy to use. I upgraded from a 300d and the controls were similar enough that the transfer was painless. The additional functions, such as live view (especially through the lap top!) are fantastic.  The camera feels well built and is extremely comfortable to use. The shutter is quiet, and the rapid shot superb.  Being able to take raw and jpg together is a useful (if data-hungry) function.|#|It would be handy to have a live view button on the body itself, rather than having to go through the menus. The live view is a little complicated to use effectively.  The kit lens is probably more basic than I would expect for the money - it's good that it has IS, but is not fabulous in low light.
9.0|#|Very happy with the 40D my first DSLR, great fun learning to use, surprisingly easy to get to grips with the main functions, great quality results and good build, really appreciate the display on the top, lens is excellent, not at all cheap. Battery lasts for ages and charges quickly, PC remote control software is fun, editing software is ok. Feel like the paperazzi with the 6 shots/second, girls love it. For results I'd say the 40D with17-85IS lens is three times as good as the best compact and 50% better than the 400D.|#|PC Software supplied didn't work properly, had to download updates for 5 programs from cannon site. Your nose touches the LCD display when you take a photo, leaving a greasy screen, ergonomics are ok but could be a bit better. Difficult to decide which additional lenses to buy, few obvious upgrades.

A huge improvement over the 20/30D which were in my sights over the last 2 years.|#|Heavy compared to the smaller body cameras like the 450D.

Good software. Love it.|#|option. Very large files (so buy a large CF card). Not straightforward to process the RAW images, but software is quite good. These are minor complaints!
10.0|#|Build quality and overall feel. Ease of use. Features, particularly image stabilisation, sensor cleaning and live view.|#|Power switch is quite fiddly, so I hardly use it as the auto power save feature enables me to simply leave the camera turned on all the time and it comes alive as soon as I touch the shutter release button.
5.0|#|The menu is uncomplicated and easy to follow . The controls are very well positionedand in easy reach allowing the camera to be operated with ease . The view finder is large and bright with good information displayed and i found the focus points very useful. I found the sports mode at six frames a second was excellent for taking photographs of moving subjects and with its continuous auto focus allowed me to capture garden birds on the feeder and select the best picture. The camera is well balanced making it easy to hold steady and when coupled with the image stabilizer lens almost eliminates all camera shake which can be seen through the view finder when holding the shutter release half way down.|#|poor the quality of the pictures were both at close up and long range the fine detale just was not there.I have tried all of the different settings including auto and manual focus, mounted the camera on a tripod ,taken pictures in raw and jpeg,nothing seems to work. I would not recomend this camera kit to any one stick with the camera on your phone as the eos 40d is only slightly better.
10.0|#|Fantastic features, excellent build quality, great contrast. Included software is very good too.|#|None really! Other than you will need to buy a Compact Flash card right away, and a bag is a must.

8.0|#|USM fast focusing lens|#|I only bought this camera because Canon make a better range of lenses than pentax/samsung. The basic body is not as good as my GX10, but canon does more lenses which have USM.
9.0|#|As the first DSLR I have owned it is complex but flexible and I am confident I will enjoy using it. I could happily score it 10 for all features but have varied it to give the impression that I have some critical knowldge.|#|Although the flash is miles better than my previous Canon Powershot S50 I already feel I would like to upgrade to a flashgun.

Also i love the fact that it takes AA bateries (some might not like this) as i travel frequently and can't rely on chargers.|#|The only thing that lets the camera down is the fact that you manually have to lift up the flash. However, this is a minor quibble.
9.0|#|Excellent feel to the camera ie build quality, 10 x optical zoom in a compact is amazing.  Image stabilzation make the camera very easy to use and the results are excellent.  As usual excellent Canon quality lens, still one of the most important things to me.|#|No zoom on video.  Wide angle could be lower. Some noise at high ISO settings but not much to worry about. It would be nice to be able to buy the camera and case as a bundle instead of having to purchase separately and pay for extra p and p.
9.0|#|Good zoom and optical image stabilzaton and face detection ,very good photos ,easy to use and very good video mode.nice to hold,some good design and interface and like the jog wheel for viewing pictures.|#|average battery life ,slow recharge of flash between shots,digtal zoom only when shoting video have to use optical before pressing button

9.0|#|Excellent camera, packed with features, easy to use and great image quality. Ideal for beginners or those more experienced with photography. Much smaller than an SLR so its easier to carry but not so small as to make it fiddly to use like many of todays compacts.|#|Flash needs to be raised manually, but that can be postive when you dont want to use the flash and instead rely on the camera to adjust automaticaly for low light conditions.

8.0|#|easy to use|#|Quite large in size
9.0|#|I really like this camera, for many and some obvious reasons: amazing power in a very handy little box that fits in any pocket. Good still picture zoom facitlity, and easiliy accessible modes. In short, a gem!|#|However, being used to another Canon (EOS 300D), I found a few things disappointing: first of all, where we live we get amazing sunsets, perfectly captured with the EOS, but NOT with the Ixus. The sun has a vertical line through it, and the picture just does not have the kind of definition it would provide in 'normal' circumstances. Furthermore, the video option is good, but DON'T zoom in as you will be very disappointed!
10.0|#|I was told to choose quality of lens over quantity of mega-pixels but the Canon Ixus has both!  Its superb lens gives stunning picture quality and the zoom takes crystal clear shots even at 12X zoom.  The camera has good design, sturdy casing and is easy to use.  It also has a viewfinder but I have never had to use it as the LCD screen is excellent.  I can't actually fault this camera as it has exceeded all my expectations.|#|No camera case!
10.0|#|Compact size. Elegant design. Superb functionality|#|Manual not as comprehensive as I would have liked. i.e. no instruction on how to find remaining battery power.

9.0|#|I found all features of the camera easy to use once you've explored the menu a few times. Very impressed with the quality off the different shooting modes, came in very handy when out in the snow and lots of indoor photos in different environments.|#|About 10 out of 300 photos came out slightly out of focus. Not sure why, maybe it was my own fault.

10.0|#|excellent picture quality and very easy to use but if you want more out of your camera there are plenty of added features that can improve picture quality.|#|this was a replacement for my canon ixus5.5 which i had for a couple of years only reason i had to replace it was i because i broke the screen! i was slightly disappointed that the 7.7 ixus has cheap black plastic parts where as the 5.5 had metal parts though the reduction in price made up for it.
8.0|#|Great camera - very light, and easy to use. Digital video and pictures clear and on the whole sharp. The software that comes with the camera is easy to install and simple to use.|#|mechanism this would greatly improve the camera's functionality: A lightweight camera is very difficult to keep absolutely still so it does take a little practice to get a shot that isn't blurred, when you first start using the camera.

Should have a proper manual of instruction and not need to load a CD each time to check operation. I really feel that the little pamphlet provided is totally inadequate and useless when travelling if you need help. I  feel very strongly about the need for a printed manual of instruction   that one can take with one on holiday.

9.0|#|Is a great camera for the absolute beginner with its Auto modes but also great for the more advanced (like me!) who also want to be able to make their own exposure decisions, whilst only having to carry around a small lightweight camera.|#|The only bad point I've found is that the menu button on the back does get pushed a lot accidently by the heal of my thumb when in taking picture mode.
9.0|#|Quality of zoom and macro images; the image stabilisation feature; the range of special settings and the facility to customise settings. Good software, too.|#|The sheer range of features can be somewhat bewildering - but then, you can always trust in the auto setting.

Very good macro at the wide angle settings. Unusually long zoom at the tele end, for a compact.|#|Not obvious when image has failed to focus - the warning light is out of vision when concentrating on the screen. No indication of battery charge until it has pretty well run out: very sudden with virtually no warning. Can be surprisingly slow at loading images onto the card, apparently randomly - generally quick but every now and then it takes quite a few seconds.

10.0|#|Idiot proof and excellent build quality.|#|
9.0|#|Generally an excellent camera in terms of features, quality and ease of use|#|Poor LCD screen, large but low resolution and copes badly with direct sunlight.
9.0|#|Has just about everything you need from a 'smaller' camera before getting a lot bigger and a lot more expensive. Excellent picture quality. A lot of great features but if I'm honest 98% of the pictures I've taken have had the camera set to auto! Has just about the best video I've seen on a camera. I've surprised myself with how many times I've used it.|#|Struggling here. If you're after a camera that will easily fit into your pocket go for an Ixus otherwise the A710 shades it.

8.0|#|Solid Feel. Excellent results when used in Auto  mode for quick shots. I like the 'chunky' feel of it and its weight which adds to the image stability feature when shooting.|#|From my point of view , and what I use it for mainly, (close up and portrait work ) I find it  excellent and cannot fault it.  It is heavy on batteries but no more so than similar size cameras. If it continues to function like now I will have no complaints.

10.0|#||#|It's a bit fiddly to get the SD card out of the battery compartment and that is by far the simplest way to access the photos. If the SD card was in it's own compartment at the side (like my previous camera, the Canon Powershot G2 for example), that would be simpler.
9.0|#|Excellent resolution and easy to use functionality.|#|Could do with the ability to capture in RAW format.

8.0|#|variable position LCD screen|#|
10.0|#|I am a serious snapper. Sometimes I want fill in flash, sometimes I want to use an aperture priority setting but mostly I want a camera that does everything by itself. This camera suits me perfectly. It uses standard AA batteries which is brilliant as you can pick up rechargables very reasonably. The start up time is very good.|#|Can't think of any.
9.0|#|Comfortable to hold; clear screen and viewfinder; obvious shutter sound so that you 'know' you've taken a picture; easy to use for basic photography with added functions for the more serious photographer.|#|The manual itself, being on-line, is rather inconvenient as you obviously can't take it with you when you're out with the camera and decide you need to use a feature you've not tried before! There are a lot of features not available on lower spec cameras which you obviously need to learn how to use.  Personally I don't like to try to take it all on board at once and will only learn how to use a feature when I actually need to use it.
8.0|#|Large LCD screen.  Auto setting produces good results if you are too lazy to use other settings.  Starter memory card is with practising with a few times before putting a larger card in - a good way to learn.  Image stabilization is very effective.|#|Battery and memory compartment very hard to open.  Half press before shooting not always effective.  Battery life is lousy - get rechargeables quickly.  Don't understand why Canon don't make memory card bigger than 512mb.
8.0|#|I haven't got to grips with all the features, but this takes good clear images.  Macro is very pleasing.  I couldn't do good close ups on my previous camera.  I also like the image stabilzer.  The Canon software which loads the pictures on to the computer etc is easy to use.|#|The battery life is very short and on this point alone I would not recommend this camera to anyone.  It is also quite complicated to get to grips with all the features, although to be fair, it does take good pictures most of the time on auto.
9.0|#|Initial impressions are really encouraging. The larger LCD screen is obviously better but still is difficult to view on bright days|#|With our previous A70 we received a full and comprehensive user guide. The user guide provided with the A720is is no where near as detailed. Unfortunately we have mis-laid the better user guide.
10.0|#|Good picture quality, and brilliant zoom, easy to use.|#|Slightly bulky
8.0|#|easy to use, great pics, price on digital cameras still quite high for most people.|#|having to purchase wheels separate, what use is the camera without a card! could at least supply with a 500mb card for the extra bit of cost,
10.0|#|Great camera, most features are instictive if you have used a digital camera before.  I only needed to use the manual when it came to the features I didn't have on my old Fuji.  Image quality is great I did an A4 picture of my friends cat and each hair stood out in fine detail.  This is a good progression for a second camera which has enough automatic settings to get you started but leaves you wanting to have a fiddle with the more advanced things you can do with it.  I also think you can't beat the fact this camera has an optical viewfinder not just the screen, all digital camera makers should take note this is what tipped me against other similar spec cameras in this price bracket.|#|It would be good to have the manual in written form rather than on disc.  I printed the whole thing out and have it in a folder which is much better for finding things than a pdf although not great if you wanted to take it with you.  The door to the battery and card compartment isn't the easiest but that's a small niggle.  Why the small memory card included?  It would be better to give nothing than this and perhaps add the saving to that written manuel!!
8.0|#|Gives very good results on Auto setting. The menu and dial are very intuitive; I got used to it very quickly. The image stabilisation is excellent. I have very shaky hands but still get good results even at full zoom. The software is also very easy to set up and use, and makes it very easy to find and edit photo's.|#|I prefer to use the viewfinder rather then the screen, but the image it shows is very inaccurate, even at long distance. For example, if you like to put the horizon a third of the way down the frame, you need to line it up with the top of the viewfinder to get the right result. Of course, the screen is accurate, but it's strange that Canon could have got this so wrong. Other reviewers have made the same comment.
9.0|#|Picture quality. Images from this camera are often mistaken for those taken with an EOS|#|Red eye correction only works well if the camera automatically recognises a correction is necessary.  Results are not so good if the frame needs to be manually set.
9.0|#|SD card, AA batteries, optical viewfinder, high quality movies with sound to limit of memory card, 2.5 inch LCD screen.|#|Optical viewfinder is inaccurate.
8.0|#|Compact design.|#|Higher than average image noise, possibly due to smaller than normal sensor size and high pixel rating.
10.0|#|x6 zoom is what I was wanting, and it is great.  AA size batteries means you can always buy fresh ones if the rechargeable ones run out of charge.  Having the viewfinder is useful in sunny conditions.  The high speed 2 GB chip in the package works brilliantly.  Power-up and power-down work quickly.|#|The carry bag offered in the package is nice, but too small - a spare chip + 2 batteries can only just be accommodated.

8.0|#|Easy to use. If you are not fully into photography, you can easily understand this camera. You can either use all facilities or like myself, leave on auto and it does the job brilliantly.

9.0|#|I have owned this excellent camera for a month. Image quality is great.  A wide range of preset shooting modes (portrait, landscape, night shots, etc) and there is also full manual control for those who want to advance their photography skills. The macro setting in particular has given me some fabulous pictures. The video mode is also useful. Good value for money.|#|Disapointing view finder.  LCD screen not great in bright light, but does the job. Average build quality. Battery/memory card compartment feels as if it will fall apart, but is fine so far.
8.0|#|Image stabilisation is great. Picture quality is very good.|#|Switching between camera and viewing mode for settings is awkward.
9.0|#|Very good image quality straight out of the camera. Very useful zoom range. A lot of manual controls should you wish to use them. Very smooth movie mode. Uses AA batteries. Is a Canon.|#|The full instruction manual is not printed but is on CD in pdf format.
9.0|#|The Powershot A720is can be relied upon to take good photos in most situations and is dead easy to use.|#|Could be better built, the switches feel a bit feeble, flash charge cycle is a bit long but that's true for all 2xAA powered cameras.
9.0|#|It is very compact yet sturdy.  The menus are easy to operate and the picture quality is very good.  An all round camera for novice photographers and experienced amateurs alike. Extensive range of options for shooting in different conditions and even movie playback option.|#|Really cant think of any!  I love this little gem of a camera.
9.0|#||#|low light noise levels
10.0|#|The camera is easy to use and the controls are well thought through facilitating picture composition.  It was bought primarily because it had a viewfinder (Avoiding sunlight reflecting from the screen) and it was a pleasant surprise to find that it appears to work through the lense like an SLR .  Power usage is low and I am still using the original batteries.  Build quality is good. Real value for money.|#|SLR.  Remote control would be useful.
9.0|#|Good quality results. Adequate zoom range|#|Battery/memory card door also could be more sturdy
9.0|#|Optimum size - not too small. Easy to handle. Plenty of features - probably too many, as I am not very experienced. Found it very easy to use the basics. Very easy to focus and the image stabilisation is brilliant. A great camera - very good value.|#|Managed 4 photos with the SD memory card supplied. Surely for a few extra pounds you could provide a sensible size? Also think rechargeable batteries should be supplied.
10.0|#|The camera is also nice and light and compact.|#|The viewfinder seems really small, but I don't use this because of the size of the LCD screen.  Of course, using the LCD screen to take pictures does make the battery life shorter, but that's the case with most up-to-date models of cameras now anyway.
9.0|#|A brilliant small camera with a good memory with a viewfinder, and an excellent optical zoom.|#|Telephoto lens takes a bit of getting used to, also after flash pictures time delay until able to next photo.
9.0|#|Size (goes in shirt-pocket, just), 6x zoom, fabulous picture quality, fast shutter response, excellent macro goes incredibly close (but see bad points), effective flash, big screen (but see bad points), optical viewfinder, sensible layout of controls.  Haven't got to more complex use yet, but seems like plenty of possibilities.  I always have loads of AA rechargeables with me for GPS, torch etc, so for me the fact that it uses AA is a plus point.|#|Had quite a few macro pictures out of focus - I may not have got the hang of it yet.  Seems to focus better if using some zoom with the macro ?  Rather restrictive 'auto' mode (eg can't force 'fill-in' flash).  Flimsy flap to battery compartment.  Heavy on batteries (but see good points).  REALLY stupid position of tripod mount point (at very edge of base, so with a mini tripod it always falls over).  No wireless or IR remote control available.  Can't see screen in bright light (thank goodness for viewfinder)

9.0|#|Small and compact fits easily in pocket.  Good zoom and easy to use menus .|#|Not so much a bad point as a disadvantage it does discharge batteries quite quickly.  Need to carry replacement charged batteries.

9.0|#|This little camera takes excellent pictures, is economical and has enough manual settings to make a perfect second camera for anyone with an SLR. For less experienced photographers wanting to learn more about photography, the A720IS is an excellent place to start.|#|It is not the most intuitive camera I have used and if you had not used a Canon before then you would need to read the manual but as a point and click it works straight out of the box. It is only the more advanced features that might require some study.
9.0|#|Quality - manual options - easy point and shoot!|#|Not wide angle enough

9.0|#|image stabiliser and zoom reach|#|Focussing can be a little hesitant at very close distances, and sometimes gives focus confirmation when the image is obviously not actually in focus.
10.0|#|Moving up from the Canon Powershot A75 to the A7210 IS was a very pleasant upgrade.  The image quality due to the increased pixel count is very noticeably improved.  Also the image stabilisation works excellently - am finding that there are many more photos pin sharp now.  Its also a nice solid camera in the hand.  The larger screen is also a major bonus to me over the old 1.8 inch.|#|The time lag between taking one shot and being ready to take another is slow.  I use top quality JPEG sizes which makes for larger files of course - not sure how much it would speed up on a lesser JPEG size.

9.0|#|The image quality is excellent as you would expect from a Canon but I selected this model because of its 6x zoom. Build quality is good and I also like the size. It's smaller than my old A40 but not so small I can't use it.|#|The time it takes to recharge the flash

9.0|#|The product is compact and lightweight and produces good clarity pictures. It can be as easy to use as you want as it has an auto option which produces good quality pictures. Even takes good quality photos in bad light.|#|
9.0|#|Lots of features, good image quality and a 6X optical zoom included|#|Plastic case, but still has a solid feel.
10.0|#|Easy to use with lots of manual features if you want them..but Auto mode really good.  Battery life good|#|A bit bigger than other similar cameras but the advantage is you can use normal batteries.
10.0|#|The Powershot A720 IS has many of the popular features at the moment, face recognition, camera shake correction as well as 6 optical zoom and 8 mega pixels. Overall this camera is a nice combination and would suit any person who enjoys taking photos of all sorts of subject.|#|If this is your first more technical camera, then the dials and settings can be confusing to begin with. The only advice for this I can give is read the instructions carefully and play around altering different things, this is the best way to get to grips with the different options available.
10.0|#||#|-none so far
10.0|#|Automatic setting works very well for most shots and focus is accurate and reliable.|#|None.
9.0|#|I find the picture quality good even on maximum digital zoom.The macro function is also excellent. Rapid resetting for the next shot.The image stabiliser woks exceptionally well. The batteries last for ever - even non-rechargeable ones.|#|every time you switch the camera on when I would have hoped to set it as default.The standby function seems to time out quite quickly.Maybe I haven't found out the correct settings yet.The written manual is basic to the point of being ridiculous.I haven't used the CD yet but hopefully it will explain the functions.
9.0|#|Can be connected to mains using universal adapter.  Great manual control features.  Great image quality, good usability.|#|No functions assigned to left and right of multidirectional button, flimsy feel of casing, low battery light flashes which is distracting and unnecessary.  Not a particularly good-looking camera.  No way of adjusting the brightness of LCD, also LCD is quite low-res.  None of these are serious problems.

9.0|#|Good Battery Life|#|
8.0|#|Good to have an optical view finder.  It took me a couple of days of endless playing but have now mastered all the basic functions.  There are endless permutations for manual changes for which you need a good understanding of how a camera lens works but I don't suppose the results would be much different to those achieved by using 'Auto'!|#|You need a degree in technology and endless 'stickies' to understand and follow the instruction booklet.
9.0|#|Good clear pictures even at the very simplest of settings|#|It is sometimes difficult to select the right function quick enough to capture the moment as you would like
10.0|#|Great point and shoot camera or you can have the versatility to be more creative. The optical and digital zoom is also good, with the cameras video quality working remarkably well. Optical image stabalizing is a great bonus for the price and has functioned well. A great macro, down to 1cm. It takes AA batteries, great for travelling! In all I have been very pleased with the performance of the camera after spending several months looking around.|#|Feels a little plastically. The catch for the battery and card slot looks a little flimsy, no problems to date.
9.0|#|It's a compact SLR based product and a good complement to an SLR. It's versatile, allowing both auto and manual options, zoom capability is great, and size ideal for ease of portability.|#|Doesn't come with a memory card of any use
10.0|#|Fantastic quality at the price.  Very easy to use but also lots of features.|#|Slightly plasticky but not really a problem
8.0|#|It is easy to use and has lots of features for a bit of creativity|#|Since it was catergorised in compact cameras, i would assume it be compact but in fact it is not, it is chunky. I also thought all digital cameras would be rechargable but was completely let down there, it is odd to produce a camera which doesn't recharge especially when the technology is there.
9.0|#|Lovely pictures, fairly easy to use, image stabilisation, viewfinder etc. More to explore with this camera.|#|
9.0|#|Comfortable to hold, simplicity itself on automatic, plus lots of manual exposure and other options.|#|Battery life is pretty short.  Need top quality Ni-Mh batteries in good condition.
9.0|#|Really quick at taking photos and photos are great quality even with the massive zoom.|#|Build quality could be better.
10.0|#|Loads of technical features that take you beyond a simple point and shoot. Amazing closeup shots and image quality.|#|Not exactly a bad point but it does take a bit of time to get familiar with all the features and be able to use the camera to its full potential. Having said that you can just point and click if that's your thing!
9.0|#|Slow shutter lag after half press to set focussing and exposure set.|#|Can't see why it can't switch to macro automatically when image is too close on ordinary setting.
7.0|#|Good value, good quality, lots of features|#|very complicated
10.0|#|Good size. Small but large enough to grip comfortably and handle. Easy to carry around and functions are easy to use...and lots of them. Easy to download and sort on the computer.|#|Like all digitals, can be difficult to see screen in bright sunlight. It was useful to have the viewfinder.
8.0|#|Excellent combination of Resolution and Optical Zoom combined with image stabilisation technology|#|Does not have remote control via PC.  My old PowerShop A60 has this and it is a very usefull feature for wild life and scientific photography.
9.0|#|Good little camera|#|Not as good as my G9!!
8.0|#|Easy to get great pics, Video really good, 6 times zoom useful, uses AA batteries so you can never be stuck without power.|#|Does not like my 1200ma rechargables shows low battery very quickly, seems to last on alkaline Ok , so may be my batts, no time lapse like the Ixus, slightly bulky.
9.0|#|Image stabiliser allows telephoto without shake; good quality video shots|#|Video takes up a lot of space (no compression) so limited in length. Not sure how good battery life is. Wish windows could just see it as a USB memory card or disk so easier to manage transfers.

9.0|#|For a small camera there is an excellent zoom, enabling you to take wildlife pictures withut carrying a massive lens about, and it is still small enought to be used in your handbag on nights out. Has fully automatic features and fully manual features and everything in between. for a camera with so many features it is easy to use. Also takes ordinary size batteries, so if you run out you can easyily get a replacement in shops any where in the world.|#|The automatic features do work well for nighttime shots, although you can easily get round this by adjusting some of the programmable settings.

10.0|#|The ease of setting the camera to fully automatic or manual and the preset functions are great, especially the kids/pets mode! The best bit is that I was expecting the camera to waste batteries but I've found this not to be the case!|#|Can't really think of any to date!
9.0|#||#|Door where batteries are installed is rather flimsy.
8.0|#|Not reliant on LCD monitor, conventional viewfinder provided as well.  Loads of features but mostly relevant + well-organised.  Easy to handle.  Compact dimensions.  Good macro-focus.  Good software support.|#|LCD screen can easily shatter.  Image quality suffers where lines are involved e g railings, yacht shrouds etc.  Heavy on batteries.  Slow flash re-cycling times.

8.0|#|A very versatile camera,with its manual settings,good for experimenting!|#|Doesnt feel as solid as earlier models.
8.0|#|Going on holiday it will be nice not to have to take a heave charger and not be stuck on a day out with a flat battery as I can allways have a couple of spares with me.|#|I haven't used it that much yet to find any bad features.
8.0|#|The Camera is very easy to use with clear icons on the LCD screen for each mode. I particularly like the choice of different picture settings and the manual control. Also the screen is great in low light conditions, as it enhances the image to make framing your subjects easier.|#|My only 2 bad points would be that the 16 MB memory card supplied is near useless as it only holds about 4 pictures, not even much good as an emergency back-up so most people will discard it, which is not very eco friendly. Also the use of the tripod mount is more difficult as its positioned at the left hand edge and therefore weight distribution is uneven and anything other than a fixed based tripod will have problems.

10.0|#|Compact, easy to use. Factory default settings are pretty much at the optimal for 99% of folk.|#|32Mb supplied card is a bit of a joke (2-3 photos), but the cards are so cheap online that it's not a major one so long as you know in advance you'll need one. The camera doesn't obey generic Mass Storage Device, so it won't appear as a drive letter but uses XP's built in attached camera option.. Not an issue if you either have a card reader or don't mind using XP's inbuilt option... Either way, you don't need to install any drivers on XP anyway, so it's not a huge ordeal - might be worth investigating if you have Windows 2000, though
10.0|#|Great photos, even when zoomed, a little complex when you first use it, but you soon get the hang of it. Great camera bought for my daughters xmas present, now I am jealous and I want to upgrade my Olympus.|#|The manual which comes with it doesn't explain all of the functions, you have to go online to do this, which is a bit hard if you don't possess a computer, again a little complex trying to follow the instructions, I think that you are better off to play around with it to find the best way to use it

9.0|#|Huge viewing screen, small and compact. Excellent photo quality and resolution|#|No seperate viewer so not fab outdoors in bright light, instructions very basic and no advice on where to find full user guide
10.0|#|Great picture quality. Quick turn-around between shots. Lovely large display. Excellent video and sound. Lightweight but robust. A lot of camera for not a lot of money.|#|Takes a while and a lot of reference to the manual to get used to all the features, but I suppose this is to be expected from an 'all-singing-all dancing' camera. Buttons a bit fiddly. Also harder to get the memory card out than our last Canon camera.

Menu options are all on-screen and pretty intuitive.|#|None found so far - usual meagre memory on the standard card - why do they bother?

9.0|#|I spent a long time researching what camera I wanted to by; I'm not an expert photographer or anything but I love playing around with them and it was important to me to get a good quality one.  My previous camera had been the model before this and I loved it, unfortunately I made the mistake of taking it on nights out and university and after many drops it finally broke. However, this is such an upgrade. Far superior, with many more features that I have yet to discover but also don't feel the need to just yet. I love Canon's and will continue to by them. They have excellent battery power and the photo quality is incredible, with crisp images. My favourite feature so far is 'Macro Digital' which astounds me with its precision.|#|The only thing I can possible think of is that the spin dial is a bit hard to maneuver and it can take a little longer than on the old model to change settings. But it is nothing particularly of note and I don't mind it.  I read all the reviews on it and am glad I ignored the bad comments as none of them have been true for me.
7.0|#|Good quality.|#|Supplied SD card totally inadequate, they might as well not bother including it.

9.0|#|It seems easy to get good results even before you have learned how to use the finer points|#|A pity there isn't printed information on how to use it so that one doesn't have to go to the computer screen each time one wants to learn a further point.
10.0|#|Fantastic little camera - well made and easy to use, with excellent image quality|#|None that I can see....
9.0|#|Really easy to take pictures and video clips within seconds of turning on. Nice big clear screen, good viewing angle and works well in low light. The best bit is strangers find it easy to use so you can get group pictures that are not out of focus with you in it.|#|Slightly fiddly menu system and videos clips are very large in size. I use a 16gb media card and took around twenty-five 3 min video clips and it used up most of the storage space! Canon need to use a more efficient video codec.
9.0|#|Excellent image quality, light, easy to operate, no fuss.|#|The metal front of the camera easily rubs and scratches, but then it is designed to take a few hard knocks.
9.0|#|Easy to use, great screen, good features.|#|Not cracked effective red eye yet.

9.0|#|Easy to use compact camera that produces excellent pictures, good firm build quality gives the cameras a very reassuring feel to the camera.|#|The lens like all the others at of this type gives a wide equivalent of 35mm which in confined spaces is quite often not wide enough.

8.0|#|Good quality pictures. Easy to use simple features.|#|Only the basic manual came with the camera - had to download 2nd user guide for more complicated features.
10.0|#|Large screen. Excellent clarity of photos. Good zoom. Simple 'point and shoot'|#|
9.0|#|I like the way it is stainless steel, all the other canon ones of its kind are plastic and they look cheap. Massive 3 inch screen. Easy to use.|#|

10.0|#|Good solid design,Large viewing screen,Lots of features, Good quality pictures,Good compact size.|#|Understanding how to operate all the various features [ you have to view the instructions on the disc on the computer]. I would have preferred an instruction booklet which i think would have been more convenient to refer back to.
9.0|#|large easy to see screen,even in sunlight,compared to previous camera|#|
9.0|#|TV, a ton of nice features and the best camera interface I have ever come across.|#|Can't take pictures in black and white (can only change after you've taken them), in-camera red eye reduction software doesn't really work and the panoramic photo stitching thing is hard to get right.
9.0|#||#|Only one I can think of at the time, is the manual could be improved, mind you half the fun is findindg out what the camera can do, I think you will be very very suprised.
9.0|#|screen|#|no case supplied
10.0|#|large clear viewing screen, excellent image quality, all normal features - superb macro facility, faultless build quality, great value|#|Small memory card provided - even as back-up.

9.0|#|Image quality|#|The Apple-esque roller wheel isn't very easy to use.
9.0|#|stylish and great photo quality|#|slightly larger than average camera
9.0|#|screen is superb and you can adjust the brightness with one button press which helps you see the screen even on bright days. It's excellent if you just want to point and shoot.|#|Some people might find this a bit heavier than most other cameras in it's class. There are no manual settings to speak of which might hamper in tricky situations. Some of the buttons can be a bit fiddly and some of the options, like deleting photos, aren't very intuitive.
9.0|#|Nice and easy to use and the buttons/wheel design works really well.|#|Only that it isn't as fast as my Ixus 75 (which I lost).  I guess that's down to the difference in megapixals.  Still pretty darn quick though!!
9.0|#|Good viewing screen.|#|I don't like the  instruction manual on a disc but would prefer a hard copy so that it is easier to read and practice features on the camera, where I choose, rather than having to be at a computer..
7.0|#|Very light and sleek. The auto options are enough for most settings.|#|The flash sometimes needs to be turned off as the photos become overexposed!
8.0|#|Familiar Canon controls, picture quality and versatility|#|
9.0|#|The digital macro feature, great for close ups of insects, flowers etc. And the time lapse recoring feature. Superb photos.|#|None about the camera. But it is annoying that the manual is only on CD. With so many features it's difficult to remember everything. And a computer is not always available! Yje beach or a party for instance.
9.0|#|Small but with big picture screen.  easy use buttons.  lightweight.  all round very good.|#|not found any yet.
9.0|#|very goog image quality, a lot of nice features and options, face detection and stabilisator, quick, reactive, and so elegant !|#|no detailed user manual, the build material keeps marks and digit prints so it looks a bit dirty after an intensive use.

9.0|#|Excellent overall quality and performance with a camera that is small and easily carried|#|The rotary selection wheel is erratic and not easy to control to rapildy select new scene modes. Too much finger pressure and the wrong scene is selected - but maybe I have fingers like suasages at my age.

9.0|#|Same style operation as my previous two IXUS cameras; Excellent indoor photo quality; excellent photo zoom|#|The outer silve case scratches very easily - mine is already marked, and it has only been in a ladies handbag iwth a soft lininig.

9.0|#|Small, lightweight yet many features.  Good quality image with good auto functions on ISO and focus.  I really like the colour swap and highlight features too.|#|Yet to find any!
9.0|#|Good, quick start-up time.  Solidly built for the most part; small; good looking piece of kit.  LCD screen is good and suggests picture quality is high, but as I don't tend to print photos out in hard copy very often I cannot comment on how they come out in print.  Overall, This seems to me to be a very good camera.|#|The on/off switch, the only part of the camera which does not feel solidly built, looks and feels very flimsy and requires quite a push to work.  Face recognition feature seems a bit haphazard - sometimes seeing faces where there are none, or failing to recognise them when they are; this may be because I have not read the detailed instruction manual properly yet (it is only on CD) and so I may not be using it correctly.
8.0|#|Image quality very good, although I think that the image stability makes some pictures look a little false. Great zoom, where the image stability comes into its own. Good macro and generally a good quality product.|#|I preferred my old Canon Ixus i, which produced good pictures and was easy to hold and operate.
9.0|#|Image quality and build quality v. good.  Colours very realistic.|#|Fiddly on/off switch.
10.0|#|The biggest bonus though is the VIEWFINDER as the real-time screens on most cameras are very difficut to see in bright sunlight. However the screen on this model is better than most.|#|It was so good that my daughter fell in love with mine, so I ended up buying another one for me which doubled the cost!
10.0|#|Easy to use, compact and with good features|#|The only drawback is that you can't charge the battery while it's in the camera, you have to put it into a charger.  Most of the time this isn't a problem, but it adds to the luggage on a trip.
6.0|#|High quality poicture;p good close up facility|#|None yet, but early days!
9.0|#|I like the viewfinder|#|
9.0|#|Useful - if simple viewfinder.|#|Mode dial very strange to get used to - no feedback when rotating
9.0|#|It is very easy to use, very compact in size and take fantastic quality photographs.  I would recommend this camera highly.|#|The button to switch the camera on and off is slightly small, but i see this as a good point as it will not accidently turn itself on in my pocket or handbag and drain the battery.
10.0|#|Picture quality is good with lots of different functions available. Small in size which fits in your pocket easily.|#|Does not have the wide angle lense. Scratches easily.

10.0|#|Very easy to operate, even my 8 year old Grandson took some great pictures. Fantastic night pictures and symbol shows in full screen so easy to read. Lightweight and does not feel cumbersome as I recalled from SLRs of twenty years ago. I think this will rekindle my interest in photography and make me more adventurous again.|#|Have yet to master battery life and was expecting a warning when it needs a recharge.
9.0|#|This is a great value camera.  Plenty of features, easy to use and so much better than smaller digital cameras.  I should have bought a SLR years ago.  It takes a picture so much quicker so that you don't miss the moment which is so important when photographing children.  A compact digital camera can take almost a second to actually take a picture, as soon as you click the button on the EOS 1000d the picture is taken. You can also set it to shoot at 3.5 frames per second which is also useful.|#|Haven't discovered any yet.
10.0|#|Having been an amateur photographer for over 40 years i find this one of the easiest cameras  i have ever used.In full manual the creative possibilities are amazing and with the I.S lens it is possible to get shots that were only dreamed of before.an amazing camera.|#|hav'nt found any so far
9.0|#|Excellent picture quality. I had a great day out at Westonbirt Arboretum and took over 150 pictures from Landscapes to macro close ups  all the  pictures were excellent. It was great to be able to just point and shoot or take time to compose the picture properly This is my fourth digital camera but the first SLR digital. The best yet.|#|I am still trying to come to terms with all the settings. Your company was certainly the best value by far of all the ones I looked at on the net, but the camera was still a little pricey for a poor pensioner, but I deserved a treat. I didn't tell the wife how much it cost !
9.0|#|I found it very straightforward and easy to use.  There's a range of automatic settings and a wide range of manual options, eg for different filter effects in black and white photography. This was my first digital SLR camera and it had an easy to follow instruction booklet and took no time at all to get going. The image manipulation software was easy to install and has a useful range of functions.|#|Manual focusing took time to get used to, and understand the right combination of buttons to press. It does tend to feel a bit plastic, but I think that is likely with any camera in this price range.
9.0|#|Easy to use, lots of features for the price, lovely photo quality.|#|If its a firts venture into SLR photography (as it was for) can be difficult to get to grips with all the features.  Would recommened a purchase of a dummy guide to go along with the camera that helps you to understand thefeatures of the camera.
10.0|#|excellent pictures quality and ease of use for someone who wants to point and shoot whilst offering loads of features for more experienced users.|#|on a couple of occasions it auto mode has been a bit slow to take the pic, maybe struggling to focus because of multiple subjects. Probably operator error and still only a minor issue when set against all the benefits. We are loving the pictures we can now get.
9.0|#|image quality is just amazing compared to the previous compact camera I had which was always out of focus. Overall I am very happy with my pruchase. I love it!|#|there are lots of new functions to learn and some not in the obvious places but I will learn them with more use
9.0|#|Exactly the sort of camera you need when first using an SLR|#|
10.0|#|I am a beginner and love this camera. Brilliant value for money.|#|
10.0|#|Excellent value. Comfortable grip/size/wieght. Vey good images|#|
10.0|#|So much lighter and easier to use than rival Nikons. I'm very impressed with this camera, it's my first DSLR purchase after months of borrowing and testing various models.|#|It's not got video, but then I didn't want video on my DSLR so I'm not bothered. Might put some people off though?!
9.0|#|one would expect.|#|In full AUTO mode the pop-up flash pops up every time !
10.0|#|Very easy to use.  Takes great pictures at a fast speed so you can catch the kids just when they smile!!!|#|Not found any so far
10.0|#|Lots of preset settings so you can get started straight away. Then there's hours of fun to be had, fiddling with all the advanced settings.|#|Can't think of any, got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it.
9.0|#|Feels great to use and superb build quality for the money. Can easily be used as a simple point and shoot or you can take manual control and tinker with the settings. Perfect starter digital SLR.|#|Kit lens is fine to start off with, but you'll be wanting a larger lense almost immediately!!
10.0|#|Excellant Camera , I was going to buy the 450D but im glad i didnt , the price differance is a lot and the picture quality of this camera is fantastic , i have had a couple of photos blown up to A3 size and the quality remains the same . I have always used a SLR and would recomend this to anyone.|#|None so far .
9.0|#|It Is very easy to use and is of a make that you know means good quality. Comes with very clear instructions and takes very good quailty pic's.|#|Having never used a SLR camera before I have had to attend a course to learn how to get the best use not just on full automatic mode.
10.0|#|1. Easy to use. 2 picture quality is excellent. 3 zoom facility is excellent. overall the camera gives excellent value for money I would recomend it to anyone wishing to buy a digital camera.|#|None.
9.0|#|creative photographer. Excellent quality images. Built in flash works well.  Long battery life.  Overall this is a good entry level Digital SLR camera.|#|Not impressed with the supplied lens cap which could easily become lost as it it cannot be attached to camera, other than that I have found no bad points.
10.0|#|Very easy to use.  Produces some excellent photos.  Very easy to download the images onto a PC.|#|None to date.
9.0|#|Light, easy to use even for a begineer,|#|Feels a bit plasticy. Nothing else.
10.0|#|This is my first proper camera so wanted something affordable that would give really good quality. The features are really easy to use but has been helpful to have a friend that knows about them to get it all set up for me. The pictures are excellent and everything easy to download onto the computer. Would highly recommend it for both amateur and professional shots.|#|Cant really think of much yet but to point out there is no video feature. However, I have a video camera for that and its not why I bought the camera.
10.0|#|I have been waiting to dip my toe in with a DSLR but have been put off by the cost and complexity, I need not have worried this has all the functions of a point and click and add-ons of an SLR, but not a massive cost, its real fun getting around the functions, I have been taking pictures of flowers to get to grips with it, everyone has said WOW when they have seen them, what more can I say? You like taking good pictures get one, good snapping!|#|Not found any so far!

The transition from point and shoot to entry level DSLR is not a particularly difficult step, however, it's not just pick up and go.|#|A case and perhaps some filters would have been nice, but for and entry-level camera there's really nothing wrong with it.
9.0|#|I'm a novice photographer but I've found it easy to use - the instruction manual is comprehensive and easy to follow. I'm thrilled with it.|#|Maybe a little heavy but you have to expect that, it isn't a pocket camera.
10.0|#|This is my first DSLR, my previous canon point and shoot is IXUS40, so it was about time to get a new one. I am really pleased with the quality of photoes, and ease of use plus amazing price.|#|none.. but if you are expecting the Live view - it's only available on Manual modes.

9.0|#|Fantastic, striaghtforward camera with all the buttons in the right place for ease of use, especially as this is all relatively new to me.  The photo techniques that are waiting to be explored make every taking picture exciting.  I'm sorry i just don't have more time to experiment with all the features!  The camera can be easily used by anyone in fully automatic mode with amazing results for pointing and shooting. Then, the presets are there for those wanting to go that bit further and the custom settings allow you to do most things an amateur would want. Battery life has lasted surprisingly long so far.|#|The click of the camera is rather loud. Not so good for those interested in sneaking up on wildlife to take candid shots. Though I'm sure most other cameras have a resounding click also. No other bad points to report as yet.
10.0|#|At the moment I am still getting used to the camera but so far I have found it easy to understand.  If you dont want to spend time setting up more complicated artisic shots it can still be used as a point and shoot on auto mode with the added benefit of good quality photos and without the shutter lag that you get on the majority of most non SLR point and shot cameras|#|It's obviously more bulky than a point and shoot camera but if you want more control and want a camera to allow you to create more flair in your photography then that's the sacrifice you make.

10.0|#|EOS100D + 18-155IS lens is a really excellent value for money product providing a great entry point to the world of SLR digital photography. The product seems very well well engineered and is sturdily built - it should last for many years provided it is treated with care. I have used film-based SLR's before (for their sheer range of use, clarity of image, range of add-on lenses and versality) and I also own a small digital Canon Powershot that I carry around. My new EOS100D offers the benefits of both cameras; the quality and versatility of the SLR plus the sheer convenience of digital photography.|#|No doubt if you spect more you would get a better camera but for me it's an excellent entry level product to the world of digital photography.

8.0|#|Camera is easy to use, the lowish score is because I have not tried everything fully. Pictures are flawless, auto focus seems to work far better than anyothers I have tried. I have a class 10 SDHC card 16gb fitted, which says it will take some 3300 pictures on the highest setting, more than enough. Battery has a very good life, and will quite happily last a whole day, which is very goog news. Nightime photo's are a real plus.|#|Cost of additional lenses. Generally all the Canon extras are pricey, good news is that there are many pattern parts to purchase.

9.0|#|I bought this for my daughter to do her college course. Nice bit of kit. Low score on ease of use is my view due to the vast stuff it does. But overall looks stylish, light enough to use over long periods and excellent photo's. (Once you've learnt to use it.)|#|In the package was included a UV filter, the package would be better if it had a small starter tripod instead.
9.0|#|Great camera, Not too large, plenty of features to get to grips with|#|none really
9.0|#|Well put together, image quality really is excellent, the lens I ended up with (the 18-55 IS) really is quite good.|#|The non-IS lens wouldn't have been anywhere near as good.
9.0|#|The camera is wonderful - well built, easy to use with pretty much all the features I need for astrophotography.|#|I use it for astrophotography, so one thing it could use is a setting for night vision on the LCD - its a bit too bright even on the lowest brightness setting.
9.0|#|Just about everything|#|Printing, the CD that came with the camera is not easy to follow. The prints are good but as yet I have been unable to size my prints and they all come out at A4 size.
10.0|#|I bought a Canon particularly as I have a Canon EOS SLR and the lenses, and Cokin filters, I have are compatible, the main feature I like. It has all of the features of my SLR but is digital.  Apparently it shoots HD video as well but I've not got that far yet.|#|None so far

10.0|#|This is my first SLR digital and have no experience but all the automatic features make photograpy quite easy and if you take enough photos then you are bound to get a good few snaps along the way.

The camera is thinner, more light weight and makes much larger video clips.  Picture quality is superb for my use making high quality photos for my websites that I design.|#|Canon does not say which type of SD card is best for the camera.  There are so many different levels of these memory cards in terms of writing speed, that I am at a loss for which is best for video writing to the card.  Additionally, I like to carry my camera manual in my camera bag for on the road...and all Canon gives is a PDF file which is impractical for printing and carrying in the camera bag.

Good quality pictures for this price range of camera.|#|Viewfinder is low resolution and actual pictures look better than the image displayed on the camera. Flimsy cover for batteries and memory card.
9.0|#|The AS1100, is a well designed and built unit. Though not the slimest compact it feels very comfortable to handle and thus encourages confidence to use the unit. The screen is very clear and the control dial easy to read and use. Video capture and play back are excellent.|#|
8.0|#|Takes photos fast, which is what I was looking for to take photos of my baby.|#|
9.0|#|The camera shake feature is excellant on this , generally very easy to take photos. Batteries are standard AA .|#|I can think of is if you take it out of your pocket , the shooting mode dial accidentaly moves. The face detection thingy I need to look at more closely as it only appears to capture 1 face rather than multiple - dunno yet still learning.

10.0|#|Light and small, yet takes great pictures.|#|
10.0|#|It has an eye viewer; the image screen is useless in sunshine ie the tropics.  Good choice of settings and is the right size for hand and pocket.  It sems to be stronger made than some others on the market which have failed when the telephoto software breaks down.  A useful small camera and good back-up.|#|

9.0|#|Optical viewfinder is a must for sunny days or when on holiday my main and also for concerts when not allowed to take pics they cant see the light on your lcd, also to take vids at concerts - not allowed.. The macro feature is great I did a test pic of one with and one without macro the result is amazing. This also takes pics really fast. its well worthe the extra money.|#|menus still not very clear and the written manual is too vague.
10.0|#|Point and Shoot.Even my wife can use this camera with ease and she is not at all technically minded. This was a priority for us as we are not camera buffs. The Macro is excellent. The software is straightforward enough and within minutes I had excellent pictures downloaded to the PC. Suggest you buy the 4GB card for what it costs. Camera feels solid and is a nice size for the pocket.|#|
10.0|#|really good image quality and it takes the picture as soon as you press the button rather than a second later so have missed the moment|#|none discovered so far
10.0|#|Small, stylish, compact. Excellent picture quality. Love the image stabilisation feature, no more blurry shots! Excellent focusing.|#|None so far!
10.0|#|Because of the colour you can't miss it.|#|Wish the small handle attached to the camera had a button you can push down to your wrist so that you feel that you are holding it more securly, like the old style. But nothing wrong with the camera at all.
10.0|#|Easy to handle and very easy to use with brilliant picture quality and a fantastic zoom|#|Not found any bad points at this time
9.0|#|Easy to use and compact enough to slip in a pocket and feel comfortable|#|Instruction manual a bit brief and you are expected to download the remainder from the software
9.0|#|Brilliant camera window.  Many features, some of which are still to be explored.  Improved switching between stills and video to prevent accidental use of video.|#|Somewhat flimsy door for connection to computer.

9.0|#|picture quality is very good. very user friendly. ideal size for slipping into your pocket.and looks good|#|havent found any yet
10.0|#|The small size and ease of use.You can view photos taken without switching on the camera.The best thing,and this is why I chose it, is the viewfinder as with my previous camera (an excellent Panasonic which i sat on and broke the screen)I could not see the screen in bright sunlight. A bonus is that the zoom is done on the viewfinder as well as the lens so it is approaching my old film SLR.|#|I am 78 years old and not very good at computors and I think it is very mean of Canon not to supply a manual in paper form.I have inserted the disc but cannot find the photos i have tranferred to my computor  which I did easily following the book which came with the camera.Panasonic supplied an excellent comprehesive book manual and i think I may have to use that camera,which still functions, to tranfer and find, print etc, from the computor.
10.0|#|Very easy to use. Night shots captured really well without flash. Sturdy design.|#|was able to format the memory card accidentally. No safeguard as to whether or not format was required as on most cameras.
10.0|#|This is a great camera, very user friendly with a simple short guide to how to get going and the option of installing the CD for lots more detail. The camera replaces an older much slower one. I like the battery system - so easy and speedy to set up and recharch; so far it seems to have a long charge. I have used the camera a lot and for flash and I really have not noticed a drain on the battery and have only topped it up just in case. Its got a view finder - useful in sunny conditions - my old camera has a view finder so I know how useful it can be.  Slim and easily slides in handbag or pocket.  Can be used on auto which does/controls every thing for you or there is the option to do your own controlling. All the menu is so eay to use and understand. I am really pleased that I choose this camera and am getting excellent photos.|#|So far I,ve not come across any!

9.0|#|A good to take anywhere camera, slips into handbag or pocket as long as I can get it befor my grandaughters who love using it because it is so easy.  The results are excellent and compare well with a more expensive camera.  Love the colour!|#|
10.0|#|I was given one of these cameras for my birthday and loved it.  My boyfriend was impressed so I bought him one for Xmas!  The picture quality is amazing for a compact camera and it's a great price for a camera that has a large viewing screen AND a viewfinder.|#|The only bad point is the user guide which gives only very basic information.
9.0|#|It is small and easy to carry and use|#|I haven't found any
9.0|#|It shows the preview of the centre focus prior to taking the photo. Fast recovery after every snap. Recommended for point and shoot users as the settings have been automatically optimised by the camera.|#|There are limited settings for different environment, possibly because most settings are automatically adjusted when taking photos. The hinge of battery cover seems easily damaged so need to be careful not to drop it.
10.0|#|It's lovely - really compact but with great zoom and screen image.|#|
9.0|#|image quality, menu easy to use|#|covering material (plastic) could be better quality, or metal
10.0|#|Excellent, all-round compact;. Stunning images even at 12x zoom (optical+digital that is). Just does a great job, whoever is holding it. Can't fault it.  Tiny - so wife loves it too.|#|Doesn't stabilise the image too well with low lit conditions  AND in long zoom.  But otherwise.. GREAT!
9.0|#|Neat, solidly built good optics for the money|#|Nothing bad to say, it is good value for money
9.0|#|The item is very light and and compact I love the colour and the many features of the camera dissapointed that the camera does not come with even a cheap case as some lesser model so|#|on a cheaper camera i had before i was able to change some setting on the camera which changed the pixel of a picture using format and i tried to do this but not full understanding (until an experence photo taker friend explaind)  what i was about to do (due to jargon) cleared my entire memory card of all its pictures from xmas to start of march o my little boys.  if the warning message would have been more cleare ie are you sure you want to delete the photo stored i would not have continued but instead to just stated do you want to save these changes(nothing about deleting photos) of which i did answer yes as i though  was just change the quality of my prints as this is what it would have don before - this in turn has made me very apprehensive about using thiscamera for important photos so please be aware of the formatting part as well as evey thing else ( i dare not touch anything now)
9.0|#|This is my first Canon and I am extremely pleased with it, the main reason for purchase was the viewfinder as I had had problems before in bright sunshine with the screen reflecting. It takes excellent pictures and was very easy to use.|#|Haven't found any yet.
10.0|#|great little camera, a lot camera for the price, this is the 2nd ixus I have purchased, I liked the ixus 82 is that I bought my daughter for Christmas  09, that when this ixus 95 came up at a great price I couldn't resist updating from my Olympus|#|THE ONLY MINOR BAD POINT IS THAT NO MEMORY CARD COMES WITH IT SO TO USE IT STRAIGHT AWAY YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND ALREADY HAVE ONE
10.0|#|it is easy to use and compact to put into a hand bag. The picture quality is just great. The view finder also helps when taking pictures.|#|None

10.0|#|Having had Ixus range models before I had no hesitation in going back to them after making the big mistake of choosing a Sony camera. The quality of pictures when there was slight movement was awful compared to how the Canon Ixus range perform. Don't think twice,any Canon Ixus range will be a great purchase I'm sure. Down to my recommendation three family members also have a camera from the Ixus range and none of them are disappointed with them.|#|None that I know of!

10.0|#|This is a great camera to use for its simplicity and easy to understand instructions, producing high quality images. Small and compact and has prodoced some excellent detailed images of my art work.|#|Not really a bad point, more probably about me not understanding how to make the flash stay off permantly rather than having to turn it off every time I turn camera on.
10.0|#|The only problem, as with all cameras with live view, is the difficulty seeing the picture in bright sunlight, but it does have an optical viewfinder to help.|#|
10.0|#|Looks good, well built, easy to use, small enough to carry around everywhere you go. Long battery life between charges. Takes good pictures. More importantly it has a view finder as well as screen on back so can prolong battery life when charging is difficult (when on holiday camping!)|#|Instructions could be a bit more detailed.
9.0|#|Very easy to use and really good quality pictures. Lightweight but doesn't feel cheap.|#|

9.0|#|Simple to use, light and compact digitial camera with excellent picture quality.|#|It would be helpful if a case was provided with the purchase package as most people will slip this camera in a bag or large pocket and this would avoid unnecessary scratching or seeking the purchase of a suitable cover.

3.0|#||#|I am annoyed that it does not allow you to crop and save a cropped photo. This was not obivious from the specification and I just assumed it would have that facility as we have had cheaper cameras in the past that have had that facility. I thought it was standard these days. Unfortunately by the time I realised I had thrown the box away so can not exchange it for a camera with the crop and save facility. I would love to be able to upgrade if I could??????

8.0|#|features seem quite intuitive to use. Can be used quickly when needed. Light enough for hauling up a mountain.|#|Lens isn't brilliant. Lack of compatibility with other canon lenses is a bit annoying.
10.0|#|A very easy to use and stylish camera that takes high quality professional pictures in all conditions time after time. I'm looking to extend the range of use by purchasing more lenses but haven't yet made up my mind which to but first.|#|None that I am aware of.
10.0|#|Image quality is fantastic especially with Sigma 70-300mm Macro lens|#|18-55mm lens in the kit is cheap feeling
9.0|#|the images are phenomenal, you can get some really impressive pictures and effects with minimal fuss, using the pre-set potrait and macro modes.|#|The LCD is only used to review shots afterwards, not used as a viewfinder. Whilst it is different to cheaper digi-cams, it doesn't take much getting used to and i actually think its better to compose shots through the viewfinder.

10.0|#|Excellent quality shots, fast turn around of images, no delays even on high resolution shots.  Excellent amateur/professional camera.|#|None.
10.0|#|Good easy to use, also works with my old EF lenses good starter camara with the point and shoot options and manual options for more control, screen is a good size.|#|watch out for which CF card you buy some don't work with the camara
10.0|#|It looks attractive to look it, and modern. It is easy to use. Having never used a digital SLR camera before, I found ease of use through the functions simple without having to consult the manual more than once. The pictures come out looking amazing. It makes you feel like a professional photographer even if I did only buy it for a hobby.|#|No bad points, but first time users should definately research before buying to make sure it is what they need and want. I found that light is needed even if you are using the flash, and many first time users should take this into account.
9.0|#|controls  3. easy to switch between point-and-shoot and thought-out modes as necessary|#|Only one grouse - you have to view through viewfinder without a screen option
10.0|#|Excellent Quality photos, fairly easy to use plus good range of EF lens available|#|Small point position of DOF button

9.0|#||#|If your're used to a digital camera which lets you change photos before transfer to the computer, you can't do it with this one (not a big deal really)

10.0|#|Amazing camera - photo quality is awesome. Really pleased with every aspect of camera!|#|Nothing at all
9.0|#|This is great to use from the start - easy quick start with it.  Also think it looks great too!  The camera bag I got free with it has proved to be a great gift as it holds everything you need.  Just need the time to get out and about to start using it to it's full potential.|#|The manual is massive and it's going to take a long time to get to grips with it all.  Also the flash isn't very strong and I will defo need to buy a mounted flash for it.

9.0|#|EOS SLR.|#|
10.0|#|as a  novice it is super easy to use great professional finish love it.|#|none so far except the lens cover does not have a loop to hold it when its removed so you haver to leave it down and it can be forgotten. i had a cmera before which had the lens cover attached with a loop and was great, but then the camera was not nearly so good . no other bad points
8.0|#|compatible with EOS lens system|#|None so far
8.0|#||#|Images, when taken on automatic tend to be darker than when taken with a Canon Powershot and a 30D
10.0|#|fantastic camera for price|#|standard lens doesn't show camera body in its best light
10.0|#|A good quality product.|#|
8.0|#|As you would expect from Canon, a superb DSLR with very little to fault.|#|Not the most comfortable camera to hold. The firmware and bundled software are a bit clunky but usable. Canon's approach to fill-in flash is counter-intuitive, to say the least.
8.0|#|Compared with my compact cameras, including a Lumix LX3, the 500D takes really high quality photos right up to ISO 1600.|#|The 18-200 lens is not at its best when photographing near objects.
9.0|#|Zoom range is outstanding one lense does all, just what I wanted. Large LCD screen, picture quality is very good.|#|Canon software would not load on my net book (screen resolution not high enough)
9.0|#|An excellent superzoom. No need to keep changing lenses. great when travelling|#|
9.0|#|15Mpixels - great for large prints. 3 frames/second on continuous shooting to catch fleeting expressions during portrait shoots. Very fast write to card time.  Fast startup. Live view.|#|It's years since I've had a SLR, so the camera/lens combination seems a little heavy and unbalanced towards the lens - but that might just be my lack of experience with this kind of camera.
9.0|#|very low battery consumming ,even at very cold tempurature (several days below 0, just the batteray very kept warm when not used especially at night)|#|above 800 asa the quality becomes very low
9.0|#|Excellent build quality, image quality and versatility - this latter thanks to the 18mm - 200mm lens.  The siftware supplied with the camera is also excellent and very easy to use.|#|Would have been nice to have a custom made bag come with the outfit.
9.0|#||#|Very slow and non-automatic focus in film mode.
10.0|#|The lens kit does exactly what I want it for and as I am an amateur I dont have enough experience to give you a report on the lens kit|#|
9.0|#|Big camera and lens combination to carry around, but if you have it you will want to use it and it produces great results.|#|
10.0|#|Just a joy to use|#|None that I have noticed.
9.0|#|Easy auto, good pictures, great lense.  Will take ages to learn how to use all the features - steep learnig curve!  I'm happy I chose it though.|#|
9.0|#||#|Haven't found any yet although I think a spare battery might be required
10.0|#|The canon 500D is lightweight...packed with features and takes remarkable photographs...Easy for a beginner to pick up and start shooting while also professional enough for an advanced photographer to use|#|the body is made of plastic and therefore less durable than other camera
10.0|#||#|TIP - Try to acquire your SD card from a rainforest in south America  if you can ;) and make sure that it is rated high enough for HD video. Mine is a class 10 and it works wonderfully.
9.0|#|If you want a good deal then you can do a lot worse than buy the 500D with twin lens kit.I also brought a trek bag and 8 gig shdc card with the camera and it still cost less than the 550D.|#|none for me considering the price.
9.0|#|Great camera for the price and came with 2 lenses which really gave me the boost in camera equipment.|#|I use it for filming also but the 500d doesn't have a mic input and full HD only films at 20fps which is really good but just isn't quite enough for fast moving subjects.
10.0|#|I cannot find anything but good points with this camera,it has all that I expected and then some.The presets are fantastic, taking the headache out of having to figure out how to get the best shot,but also has manual control for the more discerning.The lenses  supplied  with the camera  are amazing and simply open up a world of possibilities.This package with all its extras has exceeded my expectations and in a word is QUALITY.|#|Have truly found none
9.0|#||#|Cannon accessories are prohibitively expensive. Kit lenses not the greatest quality but do the job. On camera flash is a bit harsh (As are all on camera flashes)  But given time and the money they can be all be addressed.
10.0|#|Image quality is awesome. It's an amazing camera and getting everything to go with it is the perfect way to get anyone started.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|A feature packed winning camera from canon, simple enough for the novice with enough growth potential to keep even the most ardent enthusiast hooked for a life-time.  The capacity of the camera will greatly exceed that of the average user.|#|Shame there is no sun shade as standard with the standard kit lens.  A package including a canon flashgun would also have been a welcome addition from Jessops to help get the best from this camera.
9.0|#|Light and easy to handle by comparison to other makes I have owned. Quiet shutter which does not scare the animals or birds away.|#|none
9.0|#||#|None so far.
10.0|#|The camera is just so beautiful. I got it for my 18th birthday, and it was - although expensive - the best present I could have ever imagined. The lenses are easy to put on and take off, and once you get used to them, they take the most stunning shots. The canon 500D takes such wonderful photos, whether its artsy ones or simple point and click at a birthday party. I would really recommend it to anyone!|#|The only thing I would say would be to do with the viewfinder. I didn't realise that for most options you have to look through the viewfinder, rather than at the screen. this is very minor and doesn't really matter too much, but I did fiddle with the camera for ages, worrying I was doing something wrong, before I realised! ;)
9.0|#|Both lenses are Cannon so you can be certain that they are to the best build quality and fit to the camea body perfectly. The camera is easy to use straight from the box and with time and practice  the more advanced options become second nature. DVD supplied is very useful for the novice.|#|None so far.
9.0|#|Great camera, it's my first SLR and using the automatic features is great. Point and shoot. I take it almost everywhere with me and the 75-300 lens is great for getting up close, it was a lot better than I anticipated.|#|
9.0|#||#|None.
9.0|#|The fact that the camera comes with two different lenses seems to make it pretty good value for money; the 70-300mm lens gives some great zoom effects and the 18mm setting gives a reasonably wide angle.|#|The camera is still very much a new toy for me and I don't have enough experience to really pick it apart and find faults. It is my first D-SLR and it has already opened up a whole new world of photography to me, with my prior experience being based around fairly basic point-and-shoot digital cameras.
10.0|#|Regardless of your previous experience this is a pick up and use camera. Even my 11 year old took fab photos on day one. It is really light and the operation of the many features is logical and easy to work out.|#|
9.0|#|Great entry point into the world of Digital SLR's. Lots of advanced features and also easy to use for those with little experience.  Pictures are a real step up from a normal digital cameras.|#|None
9.0|#|The HD video is amazing|#|The leses are not of high quality!
7.0|#|Big screen, instant replay, adjustable dioptre setting on viewfinder and lightness, 18mp quality. Ease of operation|#|As a long retired ex-professional I find that the lenses are quite 'soft.' EFS 18-55 and EF 75-300 so the uploaded image has no crisp lines and edges. It will work a treat for potraiture and people shots but for sport and wildlife will lack crispness.  Offering a deal with fast fixed focal length lenses like a f1.8 50mm and a fast 85mm would bridge a gap between this camera and the professional models. Canon did it very well, pre digital, with the A1 which saw lots of professionals using it with the 7fps motor drive.
10.0|#|Good quality pictures and live view is great for focusing during astrophotography.|#|None found yet, but obviously the kit lenses will eventually show their limitations.
9.0|#|All good points so far|#|No bad points found in the fist week of use
9.0|#|Great DSLR for starters, like myself.|#|Nil
10.0|#|This was my first DSLR.  It is great as an entry level.  I took it straight to Norway and the Sub Arctic in the hope of capturing the Northern Lights.  It did everything I demanded of it and more.  Now I am home it is fab for micro photography for my handmade jewellery items.  Versatile and could only be beaten by buying the next level up. Easy to change lenses whilst on the go too despite frozen fingers!|#|This isn't really a bad point, however I do recommend getting one of the more specialised pocket guides book at the outset of purchase so that you get the most out of your camera straight away.  As an entry level DSLR the manual included expects certain knowledge that you may yet need to comprehend.
10.0|#|Easy to use even for beginners (like me), the fully auto feature allows you to just point and shoot until you figure out all the manual settings. The sensors for low light (without flash) photography are fantastic, so ideal for museums etc where they wont allow flash photography. The bag is the perfect size to store everything that comes in this bundle pack. The lenses are easy to fit/change. Would highly recomend this camera!|#|If wearing it around your neck for long periods of time it can become quite heavy but I'm sure that's the same for any SLR as this one doesn't feel heavy compared to some.
9.0|#|Only had it 3 weeks but seems to tick all the boxes. Easy to use for a numty like me who doesn't want to fiddle about with lots of settings, though there are plenty of settings to fiddle with if one was so inclined.|#|One small niggle, why can't the lens cap have a cord on so that it can be left attached to the camera rather than having to stuff it in the nearest pocket, possibly containing dust or other matter which may not be lens friendly.
9.0|#|It will take time to master all the functions and I have no issues at this point relating to the product. I think I purchased the best brand out there for the price I was willing to spend.|#|None at present.
10.0|#|Ease of use, out of the box, point and click. Simple and the image quality is fantastic|#|None
10.0|#|it feels good, the controls are all easy to access, the settings are easy to use|#|cannot think of any, but then I am not an expert !!!
9.0|#|Love the camera, functionality, the build (even though could of been a little stronger looking), the grip and general feel of the camera.|#|Not many creative auto functions but I will need it mainly for manual purposes so does the trick perfectly!
9.0|#|nice camera, easy to use and good image|#|not yet found
10.0|#|Well built, easy to just point and shoot but then when you want to be more creative the option is there for you and it's fairly simple.|#|Shoulder stap would be much better if was a clip on type instead of being threaded through the body and the lens cap would benifit from having a cord attached from the body to the cap.
10.0|#|lots to learn, but it comes with a good manual and Canon software. you cant take a bad picture due to the detail captured you just zoom in and trim the image. I have so far just been messing about in the house and garden and have taken the best pictures in my live. Well worth the money.|#|The tamron lens does not have an image stableizer built in nor does the camera so if I bought this again I would pay the extra and get the Canon 250mm zoom.
9.0|#|Great price, small (compact) for a dslr, image quality is amazing, great for experienced people and beginners.|#|you really need a screen protector but thats nothing wrong with the camera.
9.0|#|I purchased this camera as a replacement for my Canon Eos350D and as back up for my Canon Eos40D. Extremely pleased with the performance and, as a semi-professional sports photographer, I am impressed at how fast the camera processes the images, even at the highest resolution. The sensitivity of 3200 ISO, extendable to 6400 or even 12800 is great for taking in low light (great for under floodlights at sports events). Overall very pleased with my purchase.|#|The 3.4 frames per second continuous shoot is no better than the 350D, but for anyone NOT wanting to take fast action sports shots this shouldn't pose too much of a problem. I would have much preferred around 6 frames per second (like the Eos40D for example).
10.0|#|Very nice and simple camera|#|None,so far
10.0|#|Battery life is Amazing!!!!!!|#|None that I can think of.
10.0|#|Fairly complex but not difficult to use with use of manual and practice.|#|None really.

10.0|#|A lot of camera and lens for the money.  Very easy to use and master.  Very versatile with the 12 600 iso speed.  Image quality is superb and easily edited with the included canon software.  A good alround camera without the gimicks.|#|No found any
8.0|#|Good auto functions, software makes it easy to download and amend images|#|although the lenses were interchangeable with my 500D, I was disappointed that the battery pack has been changed

Loads of features and so easy to use, that even my 7 yr old boy is taking some fantastic pictures and easily understands the in-built features.  Most definately worth the money..

Software is provided to do this manually on a pc but I've found it tricky to keep the shots in synch with white balance etc
9.0|#|The price of the body is excellent as is the quality and usability of the product in general.|#|Both lenses provided although absolutely fine are lacking a bit in quality, it would have been great to get a good quality 70-200mm lens instead of the 75-300.

10.0|#|twin lenses to get you started, lcd automatically shuts down when you come to use the eye piece instead of selecting one or the other manually. good layout of settings. live view on screen, most of the buttons you need to use regularly are mostly under one finger. fairly light unit even with 300mm lens on but still has a feeling of quality.|#|add on lens prices.
10.0|#|Fantastic piece of kit. Easy to use on automatic, with plenty of manual functions as well. Good overall package with two superb lenses. Look forward to many years use.|#|None.
10.0|#|Picture quality is second to none, easy to use and understand even for a newby to dslr's.|#|Lenses, not the best in terms of quality. Would suggest to just buy the body and then purchase a super telephoto and decent prime lens instead - wish I had.
9.0|#|It takes amazing photos and videos. The camera itself is not that big, so is easy to take about and carry.|#|I can't find any yet!
10.0|#|for a beginner the best is offered by Canon.good features.easy to use.good quality. the tamron lens does the job well, i love it.|#|so far no. i hope the camera and lens will keep the brand flag high up for a long time.

9.0|#|OK - it's not a top of the range camera - but it's not a basic snapper either. At 18mp the images come out with all the sharp detail you need and the lenses supplied will do most of the work the average punter will be looking for. Definitely a step up from anything else on the market at around this sort of money or less. Highly recommended.|#|

Not too big or heavy if you aren't used to an SLR|#|The lenses are a bit cheep, and suffer fron the lack of IS, and the ends twist with focus so using filters is a pain.

It's very easy to use and takes great pictures without messing around with loads of settings. It does everything I need it to do. Managed to get some great slow shutter shots.|#|None really, need an understanding of what the ISO and F settings etc.. do, but it tells you in the manual.
10.0|#|The camera is still quite new so I have a lot to learn still, but it's very easy to use which is important as I'm a total amateur.

9.0|#|Fantastic camera if you want to start to become professional photographer. The combination of the 2 lenses is the also a strong point. Took the camera on holiday and when I came back I couldn't believe when I was watching the photos on my led tv: the quality is superb. Money well spent. What impressed me is the ISO  which can get images in the shadowy room whitout using the flash.|#|I don't at the moment I'm still testing it. Will let you

10.0|#|A sturdy, light case that is comfortable to hold. I have found it very easy to access the menus and features. Only ever having used cameras on automatic setting, I have quickly begun to get to grips with this camera's semi-manual and manual settings and am achieving some very pleasing results after only a very short time. I'm looking forward to even better photos as I learn to master the camera's true potential. Very good value for money for a keen beginner.|#|None so far.

8.0|#|quick start guide,  very sturdy casing , user friendly touch controls, fast shooting action|#|
8.0|#|It's light and a good size. The bundle is value for money and a great starter kit.|#|Tamron lens in this kit has no image stabiliser, which does make a difference to some of your freehand shots.  Build quality is a bit plastic like considering how much it costs.  I've switched from olympus because the accessories are too expensive but prefer the olympus settings and ease of use! The software is also questionable for editing!

10.0|#|Easy to use|#|Fps speed could be faster
9.0|#|Cracking camera for a lower end model.  I am a beginner to intermediate user and have taken to this camera very well.  I did go on a crash course to get me up to speed with the general theory of photography. Now all the settings make sense and I run the camera fully manual. I haven't used any other models of DSLR so I am a poor comparison but I get all the shots I need from this model and I am really please with it.|#|Live view mode you would think is really handy but basically renders the automatic focus useless, especially when using it to shoot video.  You have to go manual focus otherwise the camera pretty much goes through the complete focal range of the lens before going sharp.  But on that note if you have gone for an SLR why would you want to use it like that anyway in my opinion.
8.0|#|great pics, compact, great features, the 2nd lens is a must have, also very decent sound when shooting videos too!|#|no image stabilisation but not a problem if you haven't got a shakey hand!

9.0|#|Excellent choice of lens' to get started, The camera is way at the top end of entry level, and has many enthusiast features, and being a very recent model, should see you right for a good length of time|#|Body is slightly small in your hand
10.0|#|I've used a Canon before so many of the features/buttons were familiar which helps.  The quality of the pictures really is excellent. This bundle comes with the Tamron zoom lens which works really well and represents great value when compared to the genuine Canon equivalent and means you can do more straight away.  The case has plenty of room to keep everything safely protected including the UV filters.|#|None that I've found so far, three weeks after purchase.

10.0|#|I was a professional press photographer for over 45 years and the 50D and 17 -85 lens are amongst two of the best  pieces of equipment I have used for their price.|#|I just wish that the manufactures would not put out so many pieces of equipment so often.  With my purchase I find I very hard to find faults and it not be constructive to nit pick.
10.0|#|The camera itself is brilliant. The fps are brilliant and the 1.6 crop factor is great for that extra reach.|#|The kit lens is horrible, save your money for a proper lens or buy second hand.
10.0|#|well put together with lots of features and generally overall a lovely camera to operate.|#|not included .This would be the first camera kit I have purchased that did not have a proper Brand hood.

Keeping same lens fitting (EF) is great. Solid feel gives confidence in structure.|#|Can feel heavy after long session.
9.0|#|shoot. High ISO performance is amazing. Great image quality with prime lenses.|#|You'll be disappointed if you use a non-L zoom, you need prime lenses. Depth of field often incredibly shallow and automatic settings don't bring great results, you'll need to learn to use manual settings to get the most out of it so it will take time - you won't get perfect shots right out of the box. You'll be referring to the manual a lot.

10.0|#|This was an upgrade from an EOS 400D so the step up was very significant.  Main points are the build quality, which is what you would expect from a semi-pro camera.  The camera feels very solid and robust and the larger size make it feel more secure when using it.  Menu options are more extensive and, once you get used to them, are very intuitive.  Image quality is simply unbelievable from the 17-85 IS USM lens, with focussing being both quick and quiet. Image stabilisation is also a bonus, guaranteeing that more of my images are pin sharp.  Early days yet, but so far I am convinced that the camera will more than exceed expectations.|#|None other than the comparative weight of the camera after using my old 400D for the past few years.
9.0|#|Good build quality, digic iv processor is really good at controlling noise, heavy enough that it feels secure in hand but not too heavy, menu is easy to navigate and use, brilliant features for the price.|#|Really need a new lens to get the best out of this camera
10.0|#|It is so easy to use in automatic modes, and easy to use in the more creative fields.|#|It is not advisable to use when raining
9.0|#|I previously owned a EOS350D, I find the layout of the buttons and menu interface are much improved and the larger screen gives much better photograph previews. The custom functions are really useful too, I have one of them set-up so that the camera is always set-up for landscape shots.... this saves a lot of time and I never miss a shot now!|#|I find that when wearing the 50D around my neck that sometimes the mode selector changes, and sometimes even the on/off button too!

1.0|#|at this stage none. it has not performed to my expectation|#|I would not have bought the camera if I had known that it uses a different operating system to my two other canon cameras (one an Ixus, one a Eos). I feel like I have wasted my money.

9.0|#|The macro facility is also superb.|#|
10.0|#|Superb built-in lens, equivalent to a 36mm to 432mm SLR lens with Canon's Image Stabilisation. Live histogram a real bonus, camera responds very fast and has full manual control if you need it. Uses AA batteries, forget alkaline and get NiMh rechargeables - A set of 2500mAH will last for over 600 shots! Stereo sound is superb quality and great for adding to slideshows and dvd presentations. Swivel live viewfinder display a real creative plus, camera controls feel good and very easy to use without resorting to the manual. Movie mode is the best available on a digital camera, macro and super macro modes also great to have!|#|Very noisy at ISO400 and even more so at ISO800 (although handy to have the options). LCD display and viewfinder LCD display not very high resolution, making manual focusing very difficult (though auto focus is excellent anyway). Best image quality at around f4.5, smaller aperture gives little noticeable improvement in depth of field and loses some sharpness. No indication of battery level until just about to go flat!  Manual focusing a bit fiddly so rarely used. Video mode doesnt support PAL 25 or 50fps, only 30fps so will need some conversion for best quality. No widescreen on video, although available for photos.

8.0|#|Well designed. Easy to understand how to use the main features.|#|An image card was not included in the price. As with toys now including batteries, I think all cameras should come with an image card (even if it is a small one that dies not store many photos).
9.0|#|Easy to use and effects are useful ie what's going to be best for the picture. My 19 and 15 year old children had a great time with it when visiting New York.|#|

8.0|#|Bought it for my seven year old grandson. A good camera.  Good value for money.|#|Build quality could be better. But still good value.
9.0|#|Great little camera, easy to use, yet with all the functions you need. As a novice with a digital camera have found it perfect. Easy to load photos onto compter-and I'm not very computer literate either!!|#|None that I've found. Camera is perfect for my needs.
10.0|#|I read through the book first and also asked a professional photographer who told me Canon are excellent.|#|None found yet, though I have only had the camera for one week

10.0|#|compact, lightweight with an excllent zoom and picture quality.|#|rear buttons quite small and a bit fiddly, but it is a small camera, so to be expected really.
9.0|#|best price for this camera, it's also sold as the IXUS 125 in horrible colours, or in Red at twice the price. The pictures are really good.Amazing camera for that price|#|As with all compact cameras, there is that slight lag between shots that you don't get with SLRs.
10.0|#|It is compact, light, easy to pop into a bag 'just in case' you see something interesting when you are out and about, or sling it around you neck in the free camera bag for quick and easy access when you intend to take some shots at an event if on a journey. I extend the camera bag strap so that the camera is at hand level. Head shots, crowd scenes and street views - it's easy to compose a good looking sharp shot.|#|
9.0|#|Easy to use camera that doesn't cost the earth.  Great to have a deal that includes a few extras (ie case, memory card, etc).  Overall an excellent product for the price paid.  The HS system is excellent.|#|Can't think of any.

9.0|#|It's ability to take my 'L' lenses with the adaptor is great - means it can double as an emergency body|#|No viewfinder means holding it away from your body - a less stable shooting position

9.0|#|Excellent camera - pictures are stunning|#|neck strap short!
9.0|#|Easy to use and very compact|#|Battery life not great
10.0|#|Currently the best compact camera around. Packed with features and produces high quality images. I particularly like continuous shot mode so far and I'm still discovering new features daily.|#|Body feels more plasticky than previous models, although this does make it very light. Battery doesnt seem to last so long, but then I have had it turned on for very long periods.
10.0|#|Excellent point and shoot pocket cam.|#|
10.0|#|Image quality|#|Poor plastic casing for a Canon in the Ixus range
9.0|#|Small and lightweight.|#|No case or memory card provided.
8.0|#|Large screen. Physical controls as opposed to touchscreen.|#|Outer casing appears cheap to the touch.
10.0|#|Very easy to access set up features. The image capture is as you would expect and the video recording is of a higher quality than you might expect. Battery life has proven to be very good especially when dealing with video. Overall a fantastic camera for the price that has delivered everything I wanted so far.|#|You cannot autofocus whilst filming video, but this would only be an issue for those wishing to film whilst not in direct control of the camera.
10.0|#|The menu is very varied, the image quality is fantastic. I love this camera!|#|As a DSLR beginner, it took a little while to get my head around the various functions of the 600D, but I'm getting there!
10.0|#|Great as starting kit, but I would not shy away from some professional work.|#|Apart from it being cheaper than many lenses you can put on it to enjoy it even more - none.
10.0|#|Easy to use|#|No viewfinder so taking shots in sunny conditions is awkward
8.0|#|good quality pictures for the size|#|GPS tracking via your mobile phone feature is too much bother
10.0|#|Excellent auto focus|#|None at this moment in time but still learning.
9.0|#|Focusing system really fast|#|None.
9.0|#|Having used the original 7D for many years I have to say the mark II is a massive step forward! Brighter images, quicker focusing and dual card slots really help!|#|Very heavy, so after a 6 hour shoot it does start to show, also make sure you have fast memory cards as it can shoot extremely quickly!
10.0|#|Great Camera|#|

8.0|#|Picture quality|#|No Wi-fi
9.0|#|After 1 week still getting to know this camera, so difficult to pick one from so many good features, I've upgraded so it's a dramatic improvement in the quality of my shots! Great video.|#|Difficult to find one, neck strap gets in the way although you could say that about any camera! A bit heavy for trekking but then you come away with great shots.
10.0|#|Very Good camera I all ready have 7d and 2 is a good addition|#|Takes a while to find your way around the menu and controls of camera

10.0|#|Very quick to start, programable time lapse without a trigger, 65 point Focus is brilliant. Image stabilisation is also excellent.|#|Only 30 fps 1080p not 60, typically the canon branded accessories are very expensive for what they are - £80 for a battery charger (mains lead plus a plastic box to clip the battery into!)
9.0|#|10 PFS|#|Non  so far
8.0|#|great bit of kit|#|65 point autofocus takes a little getting used to for certain types of photo
8.0|#|Amazing camera with fantastic image quality that even though now superseded, will still remain one of the best cameras on the market for many years. Very tough build quality.|#|Heavy, some niggles re how the storeage cards are used, now fixed on the 1DS3. Would like to see more control over drive, such as linking to frame bracketting. Would be good to see more flexibility in terms of auto ISO settings.
10.0|#|Resilliant. I managed to spill beer in it and it still works.|#|
9.0|#|Excellent image quality and build quality.|#|None.
10.0|#|Excellent camera overall.Small and lightweight.|#|None
10.0|#|Can't get better than this.|#|Too titchy and made for people with hand like sparrows' feet. Daft small capacity memory card and no battery charger.
9.0|#|swivel screen is one of the reasons I went for this. great for awkward positions or holding the camera above your head in a crowd.|#|plastic construction slightly flimsy feeling. quite a chunky feel as well, so not for the image concious who want to slip a camera in their pocket!
9.0|#|swing-out and swivel viewing screen|#|cover for usb cable
9.0|#|very impressive zoom , excellent quality pictures, handy swivel screen. easy to use.|#|no bad points encountered so far but it is a bit bulky and heavier than previous cameras.  however, quality of pictures and zoom make up for this.
8.0|#|Ease of use - simila features to other Canon products|#|Plastic feel to it
9.0|#|Easy to use, good range of shooting modes,although I use auto the most! and a flip out lcd screen|#|none yet!
8.0|#|Easy to use, and easy to upload onto PC.  Has similar settings as all other canon cameras.  Pictures always come out good and clear.. not like some other cameras where the auto focus makes the pics blurry.|#|The most annoying thing about any digital camera... if you dont have rechargeable battery facitility, you will notice the battery life go really quickly.. therefore you will need to have a good stock of batteries (really annoying).
8.0|#|It's compact so slips into your pocket but is better quality than many much elaborate models.  Very responsive shutter - you don't have to wait several seconds between pressing the button and the shutter operating.|#|Can't think of any
9.0|#|i purchased this camera to use with a person with learning difficulties and he has found it excellent and easy to use.he is now becoming a skilled photographer.|#|no bad points

8.0|#|Versetile small camera. Good picture quality.|#|The first one I had had a defective function selector but the camera was replaced by dealer
8.0|#|Very compact.Easy to get going.|#|we have not yet found a way of varying the flash by degrees. There is, of course, a flash control but my other camera has a control which allows 1/16, 1/8, 1/4 flash and red-eye reduction.
4.0|#||#|great camera though if dropped breaks easily and repairs cost more than camera is actually worth
9.0|#|A great camera for those who don't want to lug an SLR around, but like to customise their shots. On the other hand, the automatic/ default modes also take a great picture|#|Nothing significant - a great camera
8.0|#|size, ease of use in 'simple mode', solid feel|#|less easy to use from the point of it's many features, LCD not easy to see in bright light (and I don't just mean when it's really sunny)

9.0|#|The large LCD screen which can be rotated to give alternative viewing positions. Also can be rotated so that the lcd screen is covered and protected|#|I find that the exposure time can be longer than expected, giving the subject time to move and become blurred
10.0|#|This is the fourth or fifth Canon camera I have used, and I really like the brand. This model gives really good value for money for a 7MP camera.|#|

10.0|#|Excellent camera with a wealth of features packed into a small easy to handle unit. For the price it is hard to beat especially the fact that it is powered by 2 AA batteries which makes it easy to use as they can be replaced without having to take a charger on holiday. Would recommend it to anyone especially as a first time digital camera.|#|No real problems found.
7.0|#|Very easy to use, simple identified features|#|Slightly disappointed in the quality of the images, seems to take a bit of time to reload itself after a photo has been taken
8.0|#|Easy to use.Good quality video. Easy to download to pc.Good one handed ergonomics, if you are right handed.|#|Should come with carrier pouch to attach to your belt. Could be a bit slimmer .

9.0|#|Optical Viewfinder. (Essential)|#|None found as yet.
10.0|#|Manual control, good build quailty, price. - I bought the camera as a carry everywhere alternative to my dSLR, I wanted manual controls for more creativity and something reasonably small. Image quality is great upto about ISO 400, after that noise becomes a bit of a problem, but pictures are still usable and you can always convert to black and white foa  grainy film effect!|#|Not as slim line as some so not quite as pocketable, small price to pay for the features though.

This is a minor point but with a heavy lens, it tends to extend itself by gravity when being carried, and I prefer to lock it to make it more compact.  And it's just a bit fiddly.

9.0|#|This is my first SLR camera (previously digital compact) and have only had it 1 month. Although a steep learning curve for me, I'm finding it relatively easy to find my way around and see the difference in quality when experimenting with different settings and options.  If I knew the camera better I would probably get even better pictures and so mark the image quality higher. The manual is easy to follow and very useful, especially when read in conjunction with books on techniques etc. It is easy to change the lens.  I love the span of zoom on the 2 lenses I chose and have already taken photos that far exceed the expectations I had.  I love it and am hooked - already making a list of extras I want to buy and buying books to learn more.|#|None that I have found so far, except it is making me hungry for extras which soon rack up the £'s

8.0|#|Point and shoot, with plenty of features for the expert. Commonly available AA batteries mean you will never have the problem of the battery packs running out miles from a power point. Canon quality shines through.|#|Sometimes not so hot at focussing, need to take a little time composing and targetting the main object. I often take pictures from a moving boat, which sometimes seems to 'fool' the focussing on distant landscapes. The lack of a viewfinder is the biggest problem. I had an earlier powershot which had a viewfinder and was absolutely invaluable in bright sunlight. Some of the pictures I've taken were a bit point and hope, just couldn't make out the screen in any detail.
